Confession.
At first I was put off by the performances by Brianna Hildebrand and Alexandra Shipp in Tragedy Girls.
Too smug. Too much winking-at-the-audience. Too much transparent acting.
It was as if theyd seen Heathers and I Know What You Did Last Summer and Scream and Scary Movie and a dozen other self-referential hipster-slasher-clever films, and they were owning it and not acting it.

Perhaps the biggest reveal in Tragedy Girls is the discovery of two star-potential actresses in a film from a seriously talented filmmaker.

Suffice to say Tragedy Girls has great fun with myriad horror movie tropes.
