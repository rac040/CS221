Oh sure, each of these inspirational, based on a true story sports movies is about coaches and players and situations that are unique in their own way  yet theres a certain familiar and comfortable rhythm to these movies, and it almost never varies, and it almost always works, even when were fully aware of how the music, the plot turns and the performances are manipulating us every step of the way.

, USA, which sounds a little bit like it might be the story of some coal mining towns struggles in the mid-th century but is actually based on the true story of a fledgling team of cross-country runners from one of the poorest counties in the United States, who competed in a couple of meets and then disbanded because they didnt have a chance and they couldnt afford to compete and the kids all had other obligations.

Coach behind 'McFarland, USA' shares his story
McFarland
 High, a predominantly Latino school in one of the roughest neighborhoods in Central California. As Jim and his wife Maria Bello and two young daughters drive though town on moving day, one of the girls asks, Are we in Mexico?
After a dicey encounter with some tough-looking low-riders on their first night in town, Jim is ready to pack the kids and leave town  but where to go? Theyre stuck. He has to provide for them.
Jims transition from assistant football coach to forming a cross-country team and learning the sport along with the kids he recruits, and then guiding the team through some rough patches as they encounter family setbacks and humiliating defeats, follows a path as clearly marked as a cross-country race. For those of us who arent all that familiar with cross-country, director Niki Caro Whale Rider and a team of screenwriters do a nice job of explaining the rules of the sport without getting bogged down in the details.
Heres the thing about cross-country. Its an individual sport AND a team sport. If you finish first in the state championship meet, youre the state champ! But your teams ranking depend on the finishes of the top five out of seven runners. Which means when the race is over, everyone has to stand around while the judges compile the scores and then announce the winner.

, USA still has plenty of moments where you find yourself rooting hard for these kids, even though you know youre watching a re-creation of events from the mid-s.
McFarland
, USA devotes as much time to the multi-generational Latino families as it does to the Whites.
Diana Maria Riva is a wonderful as the matriarch of the Diaz family, which has three brothers on the team. Theyre allowed to practice and participate only if they keep up their schoolwork AND their backbreaking jobs picking in the fields. Carlos Pratts is excellent as the fastest and the most troubled runner on the team. Ramiro Rodriguez has some shining moments as Danny, whose build and footwork are more suited for football than running long distances on open terrain.
McFarland
 USA has the obligatory coda where we found out how everything played out for the coach and the key members of that  team. You should stick around for that.
