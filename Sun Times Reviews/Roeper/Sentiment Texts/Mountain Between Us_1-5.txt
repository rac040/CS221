Thats some mountain, all right.
  Positive
A gigantic mountain of ridiculous, snow-covered steaming 
Something.
  Negative
For the first hour or so, The Mountain Between Us is a tedious and corny survival story, but at least its bearable, thanks mainly to the all-in performances from Kate Winslet and Idris Elba as a couple of strangers stranded in the unforgiving, icy wilderness of northern Utah, clawing and climbing and bantering and bickering as they desperately try to remain alive.
  Negative
And then  theres the potential for romance?
  Negative
Are you kidding me?

She broke through the ice and nearly drowned.
  Neutral
They were nearly killed by a cougar.
  Neutral
Not to mention the fact neither one of them has been near a shower or a bar of soap in a very long time.
  Negative
Oh, and theyre fairly certain theyre going to die any time soon.
  Negative
And oh yeah, shes engaged.
  Negative
What a perfect recipe for a Nicholas Sparks-type romance!
  Very positive
The Mountain Between Us begins at the jam-packed Denver airport, where all the flights have been postponed or canceled due to storm activity.
  Negative
Winslets Alex, a plucky and somewhat nosy and slightly annoying photojournalist, is desperate to get home because shes getting married tomorrow.
  Very negative
Elbas Ben, a neurosurgeon, has to get to Baltimore because hes scheduled to perform surgery on a -year-old boy in the morning.
  Negative
Seems reasonable to ask why Alex is so far from home on the day before her wedding.
  Negative
Yeah, yeah, work.
  Positive
Come on.
  Neutral
Or for that matter, why Ben isnt already in Baltimore, getting a good nights sleep before operating on a kid the next morning.
  Neutral
But there they are.
  Neutral
Alex overhears Bens desperate pleas to find a flight, so she approaches him with a proposition: Theyll split the cost of chartering a plane to a regional airport, where they can find connecting flights to their respective destinations.
  Negative
Suffice to say that turns out to be a really bad idea.
  Negative
After a well-filmed and suitably harrowing plane crash sequence that kills off the pilot but leaves his Lab retriever intact, because you DO NOT KILL THE DOG in movies such as this, Ben and Alex awake deep in the mountains, with her leg shattered and his torso bloody and bruised.
  Negative
Only a few artfully painted scratches mar their handsome movie star faces.
  Positive
The beacon in the tail of the crumped Cessna is broken.
  Negative
The food supply is extremely limited.
  Negative
Theyll be able to survive for a few weeks on water  theres plenty of snow and ice around to keep that supply going  but unless they find a path to civilization, theyre doomed.
  Negative
Off they go!
  Neutral
How about this way?
  Neutral
What about that way?
  Neutral
How about winging it?
  Neutral
Yikes.
  Neutral
For a skilled and sophisticated photojournalist, Alex often comes across as whiny and nave.
  Negative
When Ben talks about how he loves working with the brain because the brain controls everything, from thoughts to emotions, Alex says, But what about the heart?
  Neutral
The heart is just a muscle, grumbles Ben, as if talking to a -year-old.
  Negative
Alex believes in taking increasingly reckless chances because after all, theyre probably going to die anyway.
  Negative
Ben is a humorless stiff who insists they should formulate a plan and stick with it, no matter what.
  Negative
Now is not the time to improvise!
  Negative
So they butt heads and make up, butt heads and reconcile, butt heads and REALLY reconcile.
  Very negative
At one point you almost start rooting for the elements to win out, just so these two would just shut up.
  Negative
The Mountain Between Us actually goes downhill in the scenes that take place in the relative comfort of the civilized world.
  Negative
Im not saying they wind up rescued.
  Neutral
Maybe Im talking about flashbacks, or scenes not involving the two main characters.
  Negative
Not telling.
  Neutral
Dermot Mulroney is saddled with the thankless role of Alexs wet blanket of a fianc, Mark.
  Negative
We dont see any reason why Mark and Alex would have been engaged in the first place.
  Negative
Or any reason why the viewer should be engaged with this nonsense from the outset.
  Neutral
