Some sequels are worth the wait.
  Positive
A full two decades after Danny Boyles heroin-soaked Trainspotting blew our doors off with its cutting-edge visuals, dark energy and unforgettable soundtrack, not to mention seminal performances from a quartet of talented young actors, the boys are back in town,  years older but not necessarily an ounce wiser  and Boyle has delivered that rare follow-up nearly as enthralling as the original.
  Positive
If you havent seen the first one, if at all possible you should spend the next two hours of your life watching it, and then get back to me  and then see T.
Its not as if Trainspotting  doesnt work as a stand-alone film, but Boyle regularly peppers in callbacks to the original, from ever-so-brief flashbacks to new scenes that echo some of the classic moments from the original, that the T viewing experience will be vastly more rewarding for those that have seen and loved the first movie.

'TRAINSPOTTING' SPOILERS FOLLOW
Some  years ago, Ewan McGregors Mark Renton skipped Edinburgh and his partners in crime and addiction with some , pounds of drug money that wasnt all his.
  Negative
Mark left , pounds for his sad-sack pal Spud EweN Bremner, but he stiffed the manic and temperamental Sick Boy Jonny Lee Miller and the even more unbalanced and dangerous Begbie Robert Carlyle.
  Negative
Renton has been working as an accountant in Amsterdam, living the straight life, but now hes ready to face the past and own up to his sins.
  Negative
He comes home, where all three of his former best mates are still living on the fringes of society and still seriously messed up.
  Positive
Spud is still struggling with hardcore addiction, and has given up on life to the point of contemplating ending it all.
  Negative
Sick Boy has hooked up with an enigmatic ish Bulgarian beauty Anjela Nedyalkova with more going on upstairs than Sick Boy might realize.
  Positive
Hes running a crummy pub, using any and all available cash to score coke, and scheming to turn the pub into a classy brothel.
  Negative
As for the psychotic Begbie, he has just escaped from prison.
  Negative
His attempts to reconcile with his wife and grown son grow increasingly awkward, desperate and tension-filled.
  Negative
And once Begbie learns Renton is back in town in one of the funniest sequences of any movie so far this year, hes all about hunting down the traitor and killing him.
  Negative
Trainspotting  bills itself as T, as if Boyle and the producers are acknowledging theyre trying to make one memorable sequel  and Begbies pursuit of Renton is only a shade less relentless and untiring than Robert Patricks T- in Terminator .
  Negative
Working for a script by John Hodge who adapts and expands upon author Irvine Welshs original creations, Boyle shares our affection for these characters  but constantly reminds us that while theyre fascinating, theyre fascinating disasters.
  Positive
When Renton and Spud, and even to some extent Sick Boy and Begbie, look fondly on the past, theyre conveniently forgetting how pathetic their lives were and how their so-called rebellion against societal norms set them on perhaps permanent paths to utterly worthless lives.
  Negative
Renton has ostensibly shown the most growth  after all, he kicked the habit, got married and took a respectable job  but in his mid-s, hes still flailing his way through life, and even as he tries to make amends with former best mate Sick Boy for one betrayal from years gone by, he eagerly and selfishly pursues another, perhaps even more personal form of double-cross.
  Very negative
Begbie was the one member of the group to avoid addiction  but hes addicted to the life of crime and the lure of violence, and his attempts to lure his son away from the straight life and his frothing-mad obsession with destroying Renton would be laughable if they werent so chilling.
  Negative
Jonny Lee Miller has a high old time hamming it up as the maniacal, coke-addicted, roughly charming Simon, aka Sick Boy.
  Negative
In fact all four of the main actors do fine work in slipping back into characters they havent occupied for  years.
  Positive
Trainspotting cast members Kelly MacDonald and Shirley Henderson return in brief but most welcome cameos.
  Positive
Renton revisits the Choose Life monologue, while the soundtrack revisits a few key entries from the original soundtrack, via remixed versions or covers.
  Negative
T Trainspotting has one foot firmly planted in nostalgia and the other rooted in the present, and thanks in great part to Boyles unique, world-class talent, everything old feels new again, and everything new has the blazing look of an original and blazing piece of art.
  Very positive
