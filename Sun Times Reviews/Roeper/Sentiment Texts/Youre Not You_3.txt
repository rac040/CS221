Sometimes formulaic works.

Something that earns your heart.
  Positive
Hilary Swank 
has never become a giant movie star, but theres a reason she has two Academy Awards.

When given the right material, she soars.
  Positive

plays Kate, a

Within a year, shes unable to use the bathroom or take a shower without the help of a caregiver or her husband, who is fiercely protective of her and seems nearly obsessive about taking care of Kate.
  Negative
In a plot development that stretches credibility but 
we need it to set
 the table for the rest of the story, Kate hires a new caregiver: the utterly inexperienced Bec Emmy Rossum, a human train wreck who bounces in and out of college, hops in and out of the beds of strangers Im not girlfriend material she blithely tells one conquest, drinks a lot and has a half-assed dream of becoming a singer-songwriter, if only she could get over her stage fright.
  Negative
They invented the term hot mess for this girl.
  Negative
Bec isnt much different from Rossums Fiona Gallagher character on Shameless  a smart, beautiful, screwed-up chick who is often her own worst enemy.
  Negative
For such an elegant actress she once played the young Audrey Hepburn in a TV movie, Rossum has a real affinity for playing hardscrabble types.
  Positive
As Kate and Bec begin to bond, the wheels come off elsewhere.

The shining knight husband develops some serious chinks in his armor, Kates girlfriends are incapable of dealing with her rapidly deteriorating condition, and then theres Kates mother Frances Fisher, a real piece of work.
  Negative
Both Kate and Bec have serious mom issues.
  Negative
Working from a screenplay by Jordan Roberts and Shana Feste based on the novel by Michelle Wildgen, director George C. Wolfe nimbly peppers in some much-needed comic relief.
  Positive
Stephanie Beatriz plays Becs wisecracking best friend.
  Negative

  Very negative
Her mind is intact, but shes trapped inside her own body.
  Neutral
Its a heartbreakingly effective performance.
  Positive
Rossums Bec, on the other hand, is a whirlwind  constantly in motion unless shes battling a hangover, as if shes afraid to sit still and be alone with her life.
  Negative
Shes funny but also a little bit tragic.
  Positive
Its perhaps Rossums best work to date.
  Positive
Theres no cure for ALS.

A movie about this subject matter is a tough sell, but Swank and Rossum are brilliant, and in its own unique way, Youre Not You is one of the best buddy movies of the year.
