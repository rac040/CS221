 Annual Academy Awards, allow me to tell you about the first surefire candidate for a nomination for NEXT years Oscars.
  Neutral
Zootopia is one of my favorite animated movies.
  Very positive
Not one of my favorite animated movies of the last year or two, or of the last decade, or in recent memory.
  Negative
Its one of my favorite animated movies, period.
  Very positive
If it doesnt receive a nomination for animated feature, Ill eat more carrots than are consumed in the entirety of this magical and wonderful rabbit tail.
  Positive
Er, tale.
  Positive
Families will want to wrap their arms around this film and embrace it for years.
  Positive
Now and forever, animators cant resist stories of anthropomorphic creatures that walk on two legs, wear clothes, drive cars, exist in family units and of course talk in perfect, wisecracking English.
  Negative
Sometimes the humans exist on the periphery' other times, as in this case, its an all-animal world, with all of the creatures relative true to the size and shape of real-world bunnies and foxes and mice and elephants and giraffes.
  Negative
And what an amazing world this is, with districts ranging from the rural Bunny Borough to the upscale Sahara Square to the frigid Tundra Town to the title city, a sprawling metropolis where predators and prey co-exist in relatively peaceful harmony, as these mammals are thousands of years past the barbaric old days when predators actually fed on prey.
  Negative
Predators make up just  percent of the population, but they do hold most of the positions of power and influence, and they still seem to dominate the world by sheer virtue of their size and strength.
  Positive
For example, the mayor of Zootopia J.K. Simmons is a proud and noble lion that struts about, while his assistant, Bellwether Jenny Slate, is a put-upon and powerless little sheep.
  Negative
If you can sense some social metaphor and timely political commentary coming around the corner, your senses would be working just fine.
  Negative
Ginnifer Goodwin gives voice and life and heart to Judy Hopps, a diminutive and impossibly adorable rabbit who has dreamed of becoming a cop since she was a tiny bunny.
  Positive
Against all odds and despite her diminutive size  theres never been a rabbit cop, ever, as the force is dominated by large predator mammals  Judy graduates at the top of her class at the academy and arrives fresh off the farm at the Zootopia Police Station, ready to make a difference!
  Negative
And then the crusty water buffalo Police Chief Bogo Idris Elba assigns Judy to meter maid duty and tells her to get cracking writing those parking tickets.
  Negative
Sigh.
  Neutral
Down goes Judys ears.
  Neutral
She wants to be a real police officer, not a meter maid.
  Neutral
Enter Nick Wilde Jason Bateman, who is literally a sly fox, a career con man who makes a living via a variety of scams that are borderline illegal.
  Negative
When  mammals in Zootopia go missing, Judy has reason to believe Nick could be a key witness in the case  and with the help of Judys newfound ally Bellwether, Judy is given  hours to crack the case.
  Negative
So how great is this: In addition to being sweet and funny and brimming with positive messages, Zootopia turns into a better buddy-cop movie and thriller than most live-action films of the genre.
  Positive
At first Judy and Nick are constantly bickering, but as they survive harrowing predicaments and get the time to know one another, they 
Well.
  Negative
You know the drill.
  Neutral
There isnt a scene in Zootopia that doesnt crackle with sharp, multi-level dialogue corny and sweet jokes for the kids, clever inside humor for the adults and amazingly detailed and gorgeous visuals.
  Positive
Whether its Judy hopping around to write  parking tickets in record time, Judy'spursuit of a sneaky weasel of a bandit that leads her to a miniature city teaming with the smallest of rodents or some fairly dark and scary twists in the plot Zootopia is a legit PG film and should not be seen by the very young, rarely I have seen an animated film with such a vibrant, rich look.
  Neutral
Such brilliant voice work here, fromOctavia Spencer as Mrs. Otterton, who is worried to death about her missing husband, to Tommy Chong as Yax, blissed-out proprietor of a den of friendly debauchery, to Alan Tudyk as the sneaky blabbermouth Duke Weaselton to Shakira as Gazelle, a Gaga-esque pop sensation with a social conscience.
  Negative
Best of all: Jason Bateman and Ginnifer Goodwin as Judy and Nick.
  Positive
Its pitch-perfect casting as Bateman smoothly transitions from the ultimate cynic to showing more than just a little bit of heart, while Goodwins perpetually upbeat and undeniably pure-hearted Judy becomes even lovable when she makes some rash judgments and has to learn from her mistakes.
  Negative
The directing team of Byron Howard, Rich Moore and Jared Bush, working with an army of talented animators, have created a dozen memorable and lovable characters and a gorgeous, colorful, complex world.
  Positive
Zootopia is brimming with silly, slapstick humor and terrific one-liners  and yes, some simple yet valuable lessons about tolerance and prejudice and learning to embrace our differences.
  Very positive
Theres nothing wrong with a lesson or two when those lessons are packaged within such a great and memorable film.
  Negative
