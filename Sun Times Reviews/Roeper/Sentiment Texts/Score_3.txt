The next time youre flipping around with the remote and you come across the opening scene in Jaws, when the girl goes skinny-dipping on the beach and feels a tug from below 
Or the scene in E.T. where the bicycling boys elevate above the police blockade and fly through the sky, profiled against the setting sun 
Or the moment in Psycho when Norman Bates pulls back that shower curtain and starts hacking away 
Hit mute.

Matt Schraders documentary Score: A Film Music Documentary is a celebration of the artists who create the musical heartbeat of the movies we love, from Star Wars to Rocky, from the James Bond movies to Clint Eastwoods Spaghetti Westerns, from Superman to Close Encounters of the Third Kind.
  Positive
Through conversations with filmmakers and composers, archival footage of old interviews and of course a liberal dose of clips, Schrader celebrates the invaluable contributions of the greats, including Bernard Herrmann The Man Who Knew Too Much, Psycho, Vertigo, Alex North A Streetcar Named Desire, Spartacus, Hans Zimmer The Lion King, Gladiator, the 'Dark Knight trilogy and of course John Williams, whose work is ingrained in the consciousness of virtually every moviegoer of the last half-century.

Trent Reznor tells a story about getting a call asking him to score a film by David Fincher.
  Neutral
Reznor was elated  until he was told the movie was about the beginning of Facebook, which on the surface sounded like the dullest material imaginable.
  Negative
Of course, Fincher went on to make a brilliant, exciting film that played like a thriller, and Reznors score was so integral and memorable it won an Academy Award.
  Positive
In a similar vein, Steven Spielberg was underwhelmed the first time John Williams plinked out the destined-to-be-famous music sting from Jaws on the piano.
  Negative
Stop kidding around, Spielberg told Williams.
