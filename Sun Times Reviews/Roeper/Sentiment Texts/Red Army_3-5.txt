At the end of the th century, when the sports media were compiling lists of the greatest games across the spectrum over a hundred-year period, the U.S. mens hockey teams upset of the Soviets at the Lake Placid Olympics of  might have topped more lists than any other contest.
  Negative
It was certainly the biggest upset of the century.
  Positive
A bunch of college kids from the U.S.A. beating the best team, amateur or pro, in the world?
  Positive
Rocky Balboas defeat of Ivan Drago was nothing compared to this.
  Negative
To this day, surviving members of that  U.S. team are hailed as heroes wherever they go.
  Neutral
As for their vanquished foes  well, we didnt really care what happened to them.
  Negative
They were the villains.
  Neutral
But what a story they had to tell.
  Neutral
In Gabe Polskys Red Army, the Iron Curtain surrounding the Soviet dynasty is pulled back to reveal an immensely effective but dehumanizing machine in which hockey served as an important propaganda tool, resulting in some of the most impressive teams ever to take the ice  often at the expense of the men who were called to serve their country and didnt really have the option of deciding when they could leave.
  Negative
Polsky tells much of the story through the viewpoint of Vyacheslav Slava Fetisov, a crusty sort who gives Polsky the finger, sometimes focuses on his cellphone while ignoring Polskys queries and says, Gabe, thats not a proper question when Polsky tries to get all Dr. Phil on him.
  Negative
This is just Fetisovs alpha male way.
  Negative
Polsky waits out Fetisov and lets him have the space to reflect and to show some genuine emotion, as when Fetisov remembers what it was like to be part of the losing side of that  game, the re-emergence of Soviet hockey dominance in the s and his experiences when he was finally allowed to play in the NHL.
  Negative
At the height of the Cold War, Soviet leaders were obsessed with proving the superiority of their way of life, and hockey was a valuable weapon.
  Negative
As Polsky shows us through some fantastic old black-and-white footage, the best young hockey players in the Soviet Union were drafted into the Red Army, where they trained under the tutelage of the legendary Anatoly Tarasov, a burly bear of a man who preached an innovative, intricate style, with players weaving patterns up and down the ice and passing the puck back and forth, back and forth, until a legitimate scoring opportunity was created.
  Positive
Tarasov had his players study chess and ballet.
  Neutral
He created drills that turned them into acrobats.
  Positive
Finesse and teamwork were stressed above all else.
  Negative
Fetisov and his teammates idolized Tarasov, but after Tarasov irked Leonid Brezhnev by pulling the team off the ice after a call went against the Soviets, the rigid Viktor Tikhonov replaced Tarasov.
  Negative
A KGB favorite, Tikhonov kept the team confined to barracks for all but  days of the year regardless of their family situation, had them practice as many as four times in a single day and did everything he could to block team members from playing in the NHL, even after perestroika and glasnost supposedly opened the doors of opportunity.
  Negative
Fetisovs eyes well up with emotion when he tells of Tikhonov refusing to let a teammate leave camp so he could visit his dying father.
  Positive
Vladislav Tretiak, considered by some to be the greatest goaltender in the history of the sport, says he was away for such long stretches of time, his children wouldnt recognize him when he was allowed home.
  Negative
Tretiak retired at .
  Neutral
He never got to play in the NHL.
  Negative
As Polsky reminds us with graphics and too-brief snippets of footage showing the Soviets working their magic, the Red Army team captured gold in  and , dominated many other world championship competitions and embarrassed a team of Canadian All-Stars in a five-game series.
  Negative
A demoralized Wayne Gretzy is shown in a locker room after one humiliating defeat, saying his squad simply cant compete with the Soviets.
  Negative
Fetisov and a handful of his former teammates were allowed to play in the NHL in the late s. Most of them had to kick the majority of their salaries back to the Russian government.
  Negative
If you dont know what happened to Fetisov after he and his wife arrived here, its a story best told in the documentary.
  Positive
Suffice to say that chapter alone serves up more than enough material to make an entire dramatic film.
  Neutral
I wish Red Army had devoted a little less time to the talking heads, and another - minutes to longer clips of the Red Army team in action.
  Negative
And the epilogue that includes footage of some of the former greats back in Putins Russia, working for the Ministry of Sport, doesnt include much information about how these former greats feel about the current state of their motherland.
  Negative
This much is clear.
  Neutral
Before, during and after the Miracle on Ice, no amount of hockey dominance could prove the Soviet way of life was the superior way of life.
  Neutral
