  Neutral

And you want to be a screenwriter and get into movies?
  Neutral
Put a little more pressure on yourself, kid.
  Neutral
The -year-old Nick Reiner is the co-writer of Being Charlie, and it is based in part on Nicks battles with addiction that started when he was in his early teens and included long periods of estrangement from his father.
  Negative
Rob Reiner is the director of Being Charlie, and based on interviews Rob and Nick have done with each other, working on this film together was a cathartic, bonding process.
  Neutral
All well and fine.
  Positive
Unfortunately, the movie itself navigates well-traveled territory about spoiled, selfish Hollywood youth spiraling into drug addiction while their frustrated, narcissistic parents simmer with rage and resentment over their offsprings antics.
  Very negative
Less Than Zero, anyone?
  Negative
Nick Reiners onscreen doppelganger in Being Charlie is played by Nick Robinson, the kid from Jurassic World, and while Robinson is a more than capable young actor, hes saddled with playing a shallow, scheming, thoroughly dislikable weasel who has no one but himself to blame for his problems and isnt particularly empathetic whether hes stoned, sober or supposedly showing some growth.
  Negative
Hes a little s' is what he is.
  Neutral
Cary Elwes plays Charlies father David Mills, the former star of a popular swashbuckling TV franchise a nice touch, given Elwes roles in films such as The Princess Bride and Robin Hood: Men in Tights.
  Positive
David is running for governor of California, and while he loves his son and wants his son to get better, hes also thoroughly ticked off at his kid for mucking up the story line of Davids campaign for governor.
  Negative
How can you paint the campaign ad picture of the perfect California family when your -year-old son is throwing a brick through a church window, stealing Oxycontin from a dying old lady and acting up at rehab facilities?
  Neutral
Morgan Saylor from Homeland does a nice job as a recovering addict who gets romantically involved with Charlie.
  Negative
Common shows up as a counselor who runs a halfway house for recovering addicts.
  Negative
Devon Bostick gives a fine performance as Adam, Charlies best friend and fellow addict.
  Positive
Bosticks character, who at least really seems to experience the real highs and lows of addiction, is more interesting than Charlie.
  Positive
A movie about Adam might have been a better movie.
  Negative
But this is the movie we have, and while we sincerely wish Rob Reiner peace with his son and we hope Nick Reiner stays sober and has a long and wonderful career, Being Charlie will probably be better remembered as the vehicle to healing for the family than a movie that made an impact.
  Positive
