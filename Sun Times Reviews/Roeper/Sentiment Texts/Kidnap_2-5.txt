Bad kidnappers!
  Negative
Of course all kidnappers are bad, but the kidnappers in Kidnap are also pretty bad AS kidnappers.
  Negative
And the actors playing the kidnappers, while certainly not bad thespians, arent about to make you forget some of the all-time evil, booooo-hiss-booooooo!
  Negative
kidnappers from superior films such as The Silence of the Lambs or Ransom or Man on Fire or even Taken.
  Positive
After filming on Kidnap was completed in , it sat on the shelf all this time before finally seeing the light of day.
  Negative
Its certainly not one of those disasters that never should have been released, but even if youre in the mood for escapist action, you can wait until it shows up on a flight or on the hotel in-room entertainment menu.
  Negative
Even clocking in with a running time short of  minutes, the movie spins its wheels in more ways than one and repeats itself to the point of becoming ridiculous.
  Negative
Halle Berry also a producer on the film is onscreen nearly every second of the movie.
  Positive
The director Luis Prieto seems obsessed with tight close-up shots of Berry, and while she remains one of the most photogenic actors on the planet, it doesnt serve the performance to provide such static cinematography.
  Negative
Give her some room to breathe and emote!
  Neutral
Berry plays Karla McCoy, single mom to the adorable, slightly geeky -year-old Frankie Sage Correa.
  Negative
Karla works hard as a waitress and dotes on her son.
  Negative
We like Karla.
  Negative
In the opening montage of home videos depicting Frankies growth from infant to little guy, we hear only Karlas voice.
  Negative
Apparently Dad was never around, and now hes with his younger girlfriend, whos in medical school.
  Negative
Both Dad and the new GF are off-screen characters.
  Positive
One afternoon at an amusement park, Karla takes a call from her attorney and is distracted just long enough for Frankie to go missing.
  Negative
The increasingly distraught Karla calls out Frankie!
  Negative
and also Marco!
  Positive
because she and Frankie like to play the game of Marco Polo.
  Neutral
A woman barks at Karla, Is his name Frankie or Marco?!
  Neutral
Its a funny line, although I dont think its supposed to be.
  Positive
To its credit, Kidnap doesnt follow the usual blueprint, with the captors phoning in demands, and the authorities tapping Karlas phone lines and telling her what to say, and her ex storming in and telling her THIS IS EXACTLY WHY HE SHOULD HAVE PRIMARY CUSTODY.
  Negative
Karla actually spots the kidnappers dragging Frankie into their car, and she takes off after them.
  Negative
Off we go on a game of Hot Pursuit, with Karla who dropped her phone back at the park, so no, she cant call  driving at breakneck speeds like a skilled stuntwoman on the highways of New Orleans, weaving in and out of traffic, contributing to some possibly deadly crashes.
  Negative
Doesnt anybody see whats going on!
  Positive
Karla cries out at one point, and yep, were thinking the same thing.
  Negative
Youd think dozens of motorists would be on their cell phones, telling police dispatchers about a beat-up green car racing down the highway, with a red minivan in wild pursuit.
  Negative
Karla often talks to herself while playing a game of chicken with the kidnappers, who occasionally dangle Frankie from an open door or put a knife to his throat to tell her they mean business and she should back off.
  Negative
She begins a prayer by saying, Hey God, and continues to talk to God in a conversational style, as if hes hovering just above her.
  Positive
The screenplay from Knate Lee paints itself in a corner.
  Positive
Karla has a number of encounters with the kidnappers Lew Temple and Chris McGinn, each of the face-offs less plausible.
  Negative
Cops and civilians react slowly and in some cases stupidly to Karlas pleas for help  because if they DONT have such reactions, the dopey, bumbling kidnappers will get caught, and the movie will end.
  Negative
As Karla turns into Super Mom, brushing off multiple car accidents and more than one attempt on her life, Kidnap provides some easy applause-getting moments but grows increasingly over-the-top.
  Negative
At one point an attack dog enters the picture, but it conveniently disappears at a key moment.
  Neutral
We learn some shocking truths about the kidnappers  but we dont believe for a second theyre smart enough in a purely evil way to be such calculating monsters.
  Negative
Halle Berry throws herself into the performance, but shes stuck playing a character we barely know before her kid is snatched and she has to turn into a one-person posse.
  Negative
Karla says things like, You picked the wrong mom!
  Negative
as if other moms wouldnt be as determined to save their kidnapped children.
  Neutral
In Taken, the captors DID pick the wrong dad, because he had a very particular set of skills, skills he had acquired over a long career.
  Negative
In Kidnap, Mom magically acquires the skills over the course of one day, and makes a lot of bad decisions that result in serious injuries and maybe even deaths to innocent people who get between the red mini-van and those morons who took her son.
  Negative
