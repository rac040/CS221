No doubt the budget for The Limehouse Golem was but a pittance of the monetary muscle behind IT, that OTHER scary movie debuting this weekend, but this nasty little Victorian London horror film has more than a few blood-soaked charms of its own.
  Negative
Based on a novel by Peter Ackroyd and directed with style by Juan Carlos Medina with an effectively sharp script from Kick-Ass scribe Jane Goldman, The Limehouse Golem benefits greatly from two terrific performances: the invaluable and ever-dry Bill Nighy as a Scotland Yard detective, and Douglas Booth as a cross-dressing, music hall performer of considerable note so to speak who might just hold the key to a series of grisly murders terrorizing the city of London.
