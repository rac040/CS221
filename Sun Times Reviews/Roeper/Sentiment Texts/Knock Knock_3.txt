Somehow Keanu Reeves is now  years old and he still looks great onscreen, but by now can we acknowledge hes a pretty terrible actor?
  Positive
If youre in a room with more than  people right now, I honestly believe you could find someone in that room who could equal Reeves fantastically off-key work in the campy, lurid, erotic horror thriller Knock Knock, one of the most entertainingly ludicrous movies of the year.
  Very negative
Ah, but maybe Im underestimating Keanu.
  Negative
Maybe it takes a very particular set of skills to make lines such as, Chocolate with sprinkles!
  Negative
and Im a good guy!
  Positive
and You bleeped my bleep!
  Negative
so memorably funny when theyre not supposed to be funny.
  Positive
Or are they?
  Neutral
Hmmm, maybe Keanus a genius!
  Positive
Directed and co-written by Eli Roth Cabin Fever, Hostel, The Green Inferno and inspired if thats the word by the  exploitation flick Death Game, this is a movie that doesnt try to be anything more than what it is: a slick, twisted, extended sick joke with a classic lesson about the consequences when a good man who has done the right thing for his entire life makes one really big mistake  and pays dearly for it.
  Negative
In a nifty bit of camerawork, the opening sequence of Knock Knock takes us on a tour of the gorgeously appointed and spacious home of the Webber family.
  Positive
We see portrait after portrait of Evan Reeves, his beautiful wife Karen Ignacia Allamand and their two precious children' hints of long corridors and certain rooms that will come into play later in the story' glimpses of Karen's bold and colorful sculptures, which dominate the interior of the home and even the backyard.
  Positive
Only the plink-plink-plinking of the horror-movie piano hints at the darkness to fall upon this household.
  Negative
Its Fathers Day morn.
  Neutral
Because Evan and Karenare a married couple with children and this is a movie, they leave the bedroom door unlocked so their morning lovemaking can be interrupted by the kids, who come running in with a cake for daddy and lots of cutesy dialogue so we can see just how happy everyone is.
  Negative
Evan is the luckiest man in the world!
  Positive
Only a fool would mess up such a good thing!
  Negative
Cut to that evening.
  Positive
Karenand the kids are conveniently away for a few days, leaving Evan to his work while a driving rainstorm pounds away outside.
  Negative
The doorbell rings.
  Neutral
Evan answers, and ta da!
  Positive
Theres Genesis Lorenza Izzo and Bel Ana de Armas, two gorgeous, soaking wet temptresses who spin a story about getting lost on their way to a party, and one of them forgot her phone and the other got her phone wet, and can they come inside and dry off and call for a ride?
  Positive
Before you know it, Genesis and Bel are wearing fluffy robes, dancing to suggestive music, asking Evan all about his love life and ramping up the sexual tension, even as Evan keeps checking his phone to see when the Uber he called will be arriving.
  Negative
The original wait time is  minutes.
  Negative
Yes, the Webbers live on a cul-de-sac in a quiet California town, but how far from civilization are they?
  Negative
Knock Knock goes from titillating to terrifying in a heartbeat, with echoes of movies such as Hard Candy, Funny Games and Fatal Attraction.
  Negative
As Genesis and Bel come with increasingly bizarre methods in which to teach Evan a lesson, Reeves bellows helpful lines like Youre crazy!
  Negative
and Youre both crazy!
  Neutral
and, when a friend shows up, Be careful, theyre crazy!
  Negative
Roth confines the action to the Webber household, staying inside most of the time save for a few scenes on the surrounding grounds.
  Negative
Theres a terrific overhead shot of the house in the middle of the night, seemingly under siege from the driving rain.
  Positive
Artwork and family trinkets seen in the sunny, early scenes are defaced and marred in horrific fashion.
  Negative
Genesis and Bel work in some pointed commentary on Karens art, and they use modern social media and some creative storytelling that may or may not be true to ensure Evan doesnt call the police or try to escape their clutches.
  Positive
At one point Reeves screams at the top of his lungs for an entire monologue in which he equates the offer of a threesome with two beautiful younger women as Free pizza showing up at your door!
  Positive
As for Ana de Armas and Lorenza Izzo who happens to be married to Roth, theyre over the top from start to finish, whether theyre posing as carefree teenagers or possible psycho killers, but thats probably by intent.
  Negative
Theyre not playing three-dimensional characters, theyre playing dripping wet cautionary tails.
  Negative
Er, tales.
  Neutral
