The trailer for Goodbye Christopher Robin contains sun-dappled visuals of a lush forest and a sparkling stream, glimpses of stuffed animals with names such as Eeyore and Piglet, and a father with a warm smile telling his son, Were having fun AND were writing a book.
  Very positive
Yes indeed, the father is one A.A. Milne, creator of 'Winnie the Pooh,' and the little boy is called Billy Moon by his parents but has the Christian name of Christopher Robin.
  Negative
The narrator tells us after a great war, it was as if nobody could remember how to have fun again  until Milne shared Christopher Robin and Pooh with the world.
  Positive
And then, just a like a tap youve turned on, happiness came pouring out, says the narrator.
  Negative
Youd think this is a sweet live-action fairy tale about one of the most beloved childrens fiction characters of all time.
  Positive
Youd be wrong.
  Negative
Goodbye Christopher Robin is a film of rough edges and jagged twists, at times beautiful to behold but more often shot in jarring close-ups that make Christopher Robins parents look like the villains in a gothic horror film.
  Negative
It is filled with repeated audio cheap tricks, with everything from an unleashed champagne cork to popping balloons to a backfiring car triggering severe Post Traumatic Stress Disorder reactions from Milne.
  Negative
At one point Milne Domhnall Gleeson and the young Christopher are in the woods when a swarm of bees cause Milne to recoil in horror at the memory of the flies buzzing about in the trenches.
  Negative
He gets lost in a flashback to the horrific  Battle of Somme, terrifies his boy and comes very close to physically harming the child.
  Negative
Thats one rough journey to Pooh Corner.
  Negative
Not for a moment is my intent to make light of the very real terrors of PTSD, or to minimize what Milne reportedly experienced in the aftermath of the war to end all wars, which did nothing of the kind.
  Negative
Its just that Goodbye Christopher Robin tries to straddle the line between a whimsical origins story about the beloved Pooh et al., and a harsh character study about unlikable adults who are far better at exploiting a child than loving him.
  Neutral
Director Simon Curtis My Week With Marilyn, Woman in Gold and the screenwriters place the focus on Milne, who returns from the war, finds London society life unbearable and drags his shallow, ever-complaining, party-loving wife Daphne Margot Robbie and their young son Billy Will Tilston to a remote country home in East Sussex, which is surrounded by a vibrant forest cut with winding paths and wooden bridges and a gentle stream.
  Negative
As written, Robbies Daphne is an unbearable nag, and the performance doesnt help.
  Negative
Even when Daphne takes a break from whining to play with Billy and give voice to his stuffed animals, she sounds manic and self-absorbed.
  Negative
After Daphne storms back to London, with no word on when shell return, the kindly nanny Olive Kelly Macdonald, the brogue-voiced narrator of the trailer continues on as a loving mother figure to Billy  but then Olive must leave, and now its just Milne and the son hes barely spoken to in the first years of the boys life.
  Very negative
This leads to the most endearing section of Goodbye Christopher Robin, with Milne and son and the boys stuffed animals embarking on adventures of the imagination in the woods, which eventually inspires Milne to take pen to paper.
  Very positive
But things get nasty again when 'Winnie the Pooh'becomes a global sensation, and the world demands to meet the real Christopher Robin, and both A.A. and his wife trot their boy around as a prop, oblivious to how much harm theyre inflicting.
  Very negative
Little wonder when we flash forward to Christopher at age  now played by Alex Lawther, hes seething with resentment, having lived in a fishbowl as a boy and now spending his teen years being bullied and tormented by classmates, once they find out the new kid named Billy is actually Christopher Robin.
  Negative
Goodbye Christopher Robin tries to put a bow on the package at the end, with the icy and self-centered Daphne finally showing a trace of heart but only when she thinks her son has been killed in action, and scenes of Milne and Christopher hashing out the past.
  Negative
It doesnt quite ring true, maybe in part because we know in real life, Christopher never really forgave his parents.
  Negative
He refused to take a dime of royalties from any Winnie the Pooh-related books or merchandise or adaptations.
  Negative
He was never close with his father  and he didnt speak once to his mother during the last  years of her life.
  Positive
Like a tap that was turned on, the sadness and anger never stopped pouring out.
  Negative
