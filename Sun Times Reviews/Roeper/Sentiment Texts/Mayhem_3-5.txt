How great is this.
  Positive
Joe Lynchs fantastically creative, subversive and Tarantino-esque Mayhem stands alone as an entertainingly bloody and dark and twisted social satire  but it's even more satisfying for those of us who loved Steven Yeuns Glenn on The Walking Dead and felt a little bit shortchanged by Glenns somewhat arbitrary departure.
  Positive
In Mayhem, Yeun plays Derek, a bright and ambitious and morally ambiguous attorney with an all-powerful and of course corrupt firm.
  Positive
Just as Dereks sociopath of a boss Caroline Chikezie is framing Derek for malfeasance and Derek is trying to prove his innocence, an infectious disease infiltrates the firm, turning employees into mad, bloodthirsty zombies.
  Very negative
Which means Glenn, I mean Derek, has one last chance to take out those walkers.
  Negative
And oh do we get some brutally wonderful moments of vengeance.
  Positive
Steven Brand is invaluable as the firms amoral but undeniably charismatic CEO, who somehow presents a convincing case for himself until the bitter end.
  Very positive
Australian actress Samara Weaving niece of Hugo Weaving, lookalike for Margot Robbie is a scene-stealer as Dereks rival-turned-partner-turned  well, lets leave it at that.
  Negative
Weaving is a natural.
  Positive
She scores some of the biggest laughs in the movie.
