As you might recall, in the first Terminator movie, Arnold Schwarzenegger was dispatched from the future to eliminate a woman named Sarah Connor before she could give birth to the leader of a future revolution.
  Negative
The Terminators methodology was brutally simple.
  Neutral
He set about killing ALL the Sarah Connors in the phone book.
  Negative
You wouldnt expect me to invoke The Terminator in a movie about a -year-old Holocaust survivor with dementia  but Atom Egoyans bold but often ludicrous Remember plays a like a mash-up of The Terminator, Marathon Man and Memento, as filtered through the lens of an old Twilight Zone episode.
  Negative
The great Christopher Plummer, rising above the sometimes preposterous plot twists, plays the recently widowed Zev Guttman, a resident of an assisted living facility.
  Positive
Martin Landau plays Zevs friend Max, who tells Zev he is close to tracking down Rudy Kurlander, the Auschwitz officer who carried out the execution of their families in World War II.
  Negative
Zev is quickly losing his mental faculties, but hes still physically robust.
  Negative
Max is mentally sharp, but he can't get around without awheelchair.
  Neutral
He needs Zev to carry out a mission to locate the real Rudy Kurlander  and kill him.
  Negative
Relying on Maxs instructions, Zev takes to the road and has a number of confrontations with men named Rudy Kurlander  or in the case of the films most memorable scene, the son of a man named Rudy Kurlander.
  Negative
Dean Norris Breaking Bad plays a state trooper named John Kurlander who at first believes Zev was a dear friend of his father.
  Negative
When John realizes Zev is Jewish and when Zev has a moment of clarity and realizes Johns home is essentially a Nazi shrine, its a chilling, explosive moment.
  Positive
Attimes Zev has to write on his arm, Memento-style, so he can keep facts straight.
  Negative
He wavers between mourning for his wife and forgetting shes gone.
  Negative
Back at the assisted living facility, Landaus Max keeps pulling the strings, and things get more complicated when Zevs family realizes hes gone missing.
  Negative
The director Atom Egoyan has made some searing, unforgettable films, e.g., Exotica and The Sweet Hereafter.
  Positive
Sometimes he swings big and misses, as in Devils Knot and The Captive.
  Negative
Working with a script from first-timer Benjamin August, Egoyan delivers a typically stylish and consistently interesting visual product  but the plot goes from eyebrow-raising to intriguing to outlandish to youve got to be kidding me.
  Positive
Even the world-class cast cant save this one from teetering into the abyss.
  Negative
