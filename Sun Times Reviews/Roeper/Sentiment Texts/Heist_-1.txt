What a pile of garbage.
  Negative
Robert De Niro is one of the greatest actors the movie universe has ever known  but when hes bad hes painfully bad, and its hard to recall a more terrible performance in De Niros career than his weirdly off-key work in Heist.
  Positive
Even De Niros hair, jewelry and wardrobe miss the mark inthis ugly, vile, stilted and dopey thriller.
  Neutral
If it were possible for cuff links to give a bad performance, theyre doing just that in this film.
  Negative
The Wrap said it was described as a mix of Dog Day Afternoon and Speed '  and indeed this thrill-free thriller DOES rip off those films, but with a complete and astonishing lack of style.
  Negative
De Niro plays The Pope, because that way we know hes in charge.
  Negative
Hes a very, very, very bad man who runs a casino and is involved in all sorts of dirty dealing.
  Negative
Jeffrey Dean Morgan is Vaughn, who works at the casino and comes to The Pope asking for a favor, i.e., some , to pay the medical bills for Vaughns dying daughter.
  Negative
I mean, this is what were dealing with here.
  Negative
The Pope says no to Vaughns request.
  Negative
A desperate Vaughn hatches a truly stupid plan to rip off The Popes casino.
  Negative
Cue the medium-grade action sequences and the horrendous plot twists.
  Negative
After the heist goes horribly wrong and were subjected to a soundtrack more annoying than late summer bees buzzing in your ear, Vaughn and his Neanderthal partner-in-crime Cox a loud, abrasive, irritating Dave Bautista, turning in one of the worst acting jobs in recent memory hijack a bus.
  Very negative
From that point forward, Heist goes from lousy to even worse.
  Negative
The screenplay is so clunky, not a single cast member manages to sound believable.
  Negative
Familiar, likable actors from Kate Bosworth to Gina Carano to Morris Chestnut are buried under an avalanche of awful.
  Negative
Youve been warned.
