Nearly every scene in Dark Night reminds us the writer-director is a gifted stylist with an avant-garde artists knack for provoking.
  Positive
And irritating.
  Negative
And engaging in self-indulgence.
  Positive
Even the title is a too clever-by-half play on words.
  Negative
Writer-director Tim Suttons fictional film directly references the mass murder committed in an Aurora, Colorado, theater, during a showing of The Dark Knight Rises.
  Negative

  Negative
A theater showing a film called The Dark Night.
  Positive
This is by no means the first drama focusing on individuals whohave been devastated or are about to be rocked by shooting sprees.

  Positive
The mournful and unforgettable Beautiful Boy  centered on the parents of a teenage shooter.
  Positive
In the little-seen but brilliant Rudderless , Billy Crudup gave one of the best performances of the year as a father whose life crumbles after a mass shooting on campus.
  Positive
Dark Night cannot match the aforementioned films for their depth, their insight  or their performances.
  Negative
Rudderless Crudup, Anton Yelchin, Felicity Huffman and Beautiful Boy Maria Bello, Michael Sheen featured top-tier actors.
  Positive
Most of the actors in Elephant were unknowns, but Van Sant knows how to draw natural performances.
  Positive
The non-professional actors in Dark Night arent asked to carry heavy loads of dialogue and emoting, but theres still something amateurish in most of their performances.

Nearly everyone we meet is alone, even when theyre with other people.
  Negative
Theyre isolated, they seem numb to the life around them and of course theyre all about cell phones and video games and some vague need to be noticed online, if not in the real world.
  Negative
Many of Suttons haunting, nearly still images of characters are accompanied by the too-obvious wailings of Maica Armata on the soundtrack.
  Negative
Instead of building the tension, they only serve to heighten the lack of purpose.
  Negative
To its credit, Dark Night does not exploit or glamorize the gun culture, nor does it attempt to hammer us over the head with social or political views.
  Negative
Sutton is undeniably talented.
  Positive
Better, deeper, richer work is almost sure to follow.
