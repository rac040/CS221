Kevin Costner is one of the finest un-flashy actors of our time.
  Very positive
Costner rarely strives for the operatic, over-the-top moves of a Johnny Depp or a Sean Penn, but hes as comfortable and as natural as it gets on the big screen.
  Positive
Pretty much past the days of playing rakish rebels and dashing leading men, Costner  who just turned   is still one of those actors whose mere attachment to a film gives it a certain cachet.
  Positive
In writer-director Mike Binders uneven but provocative Black or White, Costner plays a grandfather for the first time in his career.
  Negative
A grandfather grieving for his longtime wife, who was killed in a car accident.
  Negative
A grandfather who has suddenly become a single parent to a biracial little girl.
  Neutral
A grandfather who uses the n-word when berating the father of that little girl.
  Neutral
A grandfather with a serious drinking problem.
  Negative
Its one of the most complex characters Costner has played, and he delivers an intense, strong, darkly funny and moving performance in a movie that dares to raise issues and address situations that still make a lot of people uncomfortable.
  Very positive
Costners Elliott Anderson and his wife played by Jennifer Ehle in flashback and dreamlike sequences have raised their -year-old granddaughter Eloise Jillian Estell in one of the more charming kid-actor performances in memory since the girlwas born.

Why did the grandparents have Eloise?
  Negative
SPOILER ALERT.
  Neutral
Their estranged teenage daughter died giving birth to Eloise.
  Negative
And Eloises father, a half-dozen years older than their daughter, was a crack addict and small-time crook who couldnt take care of himself, let alone a baby.
  Negative
And thats just the beginning of the melodrama.
  Negative
Its clear Elliott loves his granddaughter, but it was her grandma who handled the all the details like combing Eloises hair and making her breakfast and getting her to school.
  Positive
Eloise patiently walks her grandfather through the paces  no small feat given Elliott could be three-plus sheets to the wind at any given time.
  Negative
Elliotts drinking escalates to the point where Eloises well-being could be an issue.
  Negative
Enter Eloises fraternal grandmother, Rowena Octavia Spender, a life force who runs a number of small businesses out of her home and is taking care of an extended family of relatives.
  Positive
Now that Eloises maternal grandmother is gone and its just the irascible, hard-drinking Elliott looking after Eloise, Rowena turns to her brother Jeremiah Anthony Mackie, a hotshot attorney, to sue for custody of Eloise.
  Negative
He has a problem with black people, says Jeremiah in Rowenas first meeting with the legal team.
  Negative
Rowena flinches.
  Neutral
She says she never made such a claim.
  Neutral
He has a problem with black people, repeats Jeremiah, making it clear that if theyre to win this case, theyre going to have to play that card.
  Negative

  Negative
Things arent going to get ugly.
  Negative
Theyre going to start ugly.
  Negative
Binder who teamed up with Costner in The Upside of Anger, one of the better films of  based Black or White in part on some of his own family experiences.
  Positive
Binder doesnt shy away from some difficult issues and a few blunt moments that will make you wince, e.g., when Elliott refers to Reggie as a street n'', or when the fiercely protective Rowena finally faces the truth about one of her own family members and unleashes the full extent of her fury.
  Negative
The custody hearing, at times about as realistic as one of those afternoon-judge TV shows, does have some powerful moments, as when Elliott gives a speech in which he thinks hes making some great points but is actually doing nearly as much harm to himself as Jack Nicholsons character did to his own case in A Few Good Men.
  Positive
At times the proceedings take great leaps of poetic license, with the judge constantly warning Rowena to sit down and be quiet but never doing anything about her outbursts.
  Positive
Costners performance is filled with memorable moments, from his pitch-perfect reaction to his wifes death, to his earnest attempts to get more involved with Eloises day-to-day activities, to the stupid choices he makes after hes had too much to drink.
  Negative
Octavia Spencer owns every scene shes in.
  Negative
Mackie does fine work playing the straight man to Costner and to Spencer.
  Positive
Even with a somewhat disappointing climactic confrontation that leads to a predictable resolution, Black or White is a timely reminder of how none of us is really color-blind.
  Negative
