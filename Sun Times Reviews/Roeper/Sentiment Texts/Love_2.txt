Hey, those actors arent just pretending to have the sex, theyre really having the sex on camera!
  Negative
Shocking.
  Neutral
Shocking how mundane and tedious graphic sex can be in Gasper Noes Love, an artfully shot and occasionally provocative but ultimately underwhelming and self-indulgent film about pretty people who are all about instant gratification and then a bit stunned when there are actual consequences to deal with.
  Negative
No doubt their lives are more interesting to them than they were to me.
  Neutral
If you dont know what youre in for, the opening scene of Love might have you dropping your popcorn and wondering if youve wandered into the Last Porn House in America.
  Negative
Murphy Karl Glusman and his girlfriend Electra Aomi Muyock are engaging in an intimate act, and lets just say Murphys assets are front and center, with no shadowy trickery or prosthetics or stunt double quick-cuts involved.
  Positive
From that encounter we jump back and forth on the timeline of a tangled sexual web involving Murphy, Electra and their new neighbor Omi Klara Kristin, a fetching blonde who joins the couple for a bite to eat and then almost immediately tumbles into bed with them for a threesome that seems choreographed by Cirque de Soleil.
  Negative
Not that Murphy limits his dalliances just to the lover and the mistress.
  Neutral
Hes quite the player.
  Neutral
Murphy, we learn, is an American in Paris.
  Neutral
He talks about wanting to become a filmmaker.
  Positive
His favorite movie is : A Space Odyssey, and he cant BELIEVE Electra has never seen it.
  Positive
Murphy says wants to make movies from blood and sweat and other bodily fluids, and just listening to him, you kinda hope he never makes a feature film because it sounds like hes on the road to making pretentious tripe.
  Negative
More than once during this two-hour, -minute excursion, I was thinking: Please stop talking, Murphy.
  Negative
Noe and cinematographer Benoit Debie shoot the sex scenes in lush colors, lingering over the gorgeous bodies of the three main characters.
  Negative
Even a simple scene with two characters talking in a diner is framed beautifully, with lush colors popping out from the screen.
  Positive
The camera is often static, giving us ample time to marvel at the background detail and the creative lighting.
  Positive
The problem is, the sex scenes go on for  well, for as long as sex sometimes goes on, and when people are writhing about and the music is amped up and thats about it, were not really going anywhere with the story, are we?
  Negative
Not that theres a shortage of story.
  Negative
Love delves into soap opera material.
  Neutral
Theres a pregnancy, much drug abuse, a mystery surrounding someone who goes missing.
  Negative
If only we knew more about these characters other than a few background details and what they look like when theyre making love.
  Neutral
The symbolism here is not subtle, extending even to the names of the characters.
  Negative
Murphy is a screw-up who embodies Murphys Law.
  Negative
Electra has family issues, just like her counterpart from Greek mythology.
  Neutral
At one point a certain body part of the director himself makes a cameo thats right in your face especially if youre watching Love in D.
  Positive
When Murphy shouts in the night, Im the one whos hurting right now!
  Negative
I nodded.
  Neutral
You and me both buddy.
