The Terminator was always funny, whether he was a cyborg assassin sent from the future to assassinate Sarah Connor, or a reprogrammed good-guy robot protecting Sarah from more advanced and evil robots such as the T- or the T-X.
  Positive
Of course, he wasnt trying to be funny, which is why lines such as Ill be back killed.
  Negative
But he was also terrifying, and never cuddly.
  Negative
We dont want a cuddly Terminator, do we?
  Negative
In the admittedly well-made and action-packed but ridiculously convoluted and sometimes even off-putting Terminator Genisys, the fantastically entertaining Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as the old-school cyborg who never uses  words when five will do  but hes actually called Pops by Sarah Connor throughout the movie.
  Negative
She named him that because  well, I dont want to give it away.
  Positive
All Im saying is, Pops is a character in a Muppets movie, not a badass cyborg!
  Negative
Terminator Genisys is the fifth installment in the movie franchise, and by now its clear they could have stopped after The Terminator  and Terminator : Judgment Day  and we would have had one of the best one-two punches in modern movie history, end of story.
  Negative
Even though Rise of the Machines  and Salvation  had their moments, with each succeeding film, the events of the first two movies lose their dramatic gravitas, because that dang Skynet synthetic intelligent machine conglomerate keeps reaching into the past to rearrange everything.
  Negative
SPOILER ALERTS coming, Terminator Genisys takes the forget everything youve learned before concept to a whole new level, and thats what I mean about it being a little insulting and off-putting.
  Negative
You present us with this whole new timeline, this whole new set of circumstances for Sarah Conner and her son John, not to mention Kyle Reese Johns father and the Terminator, I mean, Pops?
  Negative
And were supposed to just forget all that happened in the first two movies?
  Negative
What if we dont want to?
  Neutral
Genisys jump-starts in , where John Connor this time played by Jason Clarke is leading the human resistance against the machines.
  Negative
Sidebar: The opening credits keep popping up for at least the first  minutes of the movie.
  Negative
Ive always found that drag-it-out technique to be distracting, as if were being told the movie is STILL just starting.
  Negative
It appears as if the humans are about to win, but Skynet has that fallback emergency plan  a giant time machine so they can send a T- cyborg back to  to kill Johns mother Sarah before John can be born.
  Negative
But of course John knows about that plan, and we see the moment where Kyle Reese volunteers to go back in time, and of course because weve seen the original movie, we know Kyle protects Sarah from the Terminator and falls in love with her and fathers her child and then, well, its curtains for Kyle.
  Negative
Once were back in , however, lets just say the game has changed.
  Negative
Sarah Emilia Clarke, your Khaleesi from Game of Thrones has teamed up with the protective cyborg known as the Guardian, or as she calls him, Pops Schwarzenegger, and yes, theres an explanation for why this robot has aged.
  Negative
Im old, not obsolete, Pops keeps telling Kyle Reese, as he eyes the lad like a protective father not sure his boy is good enough for his daughter.
  Negative
We hop from  to , the plan being for Sarah, Kyle and the Guardian to destroy Genisys, a cloud-like operating system thats really a Trojan horse for the evil Skynet.
  Negative
Soon were in Back to the Future territory, with characters hopping timelines, meeting future andor past versions of themselves and generally getting brain freezes as they all try to make sense of the ever-bending rules of time travel.
  Negative
Clarke is a charmer, but she doesnt have Linda Hamiltons ruthless determination.
  Positive
Jai Courtney makes for a bland Kyle Reese.
  Negative
Michael Biehn rarely gets credit for his strong work as Reese in the original film.
  Positive
Byung-hun Lee is a deadpan force as a new T- killing machine, but even that performance pales next to Robert Patricks work in Judgment Day.
  Negative
J.K. Simmons livens things up as a crackpot cop in  who witnesses some events in  that convinced him time-traveling robots are real.
  Negative
The best thing in the movie is Schwarzenegger, who delivers the Guardians lines with perfect timing and creates an empathetic character, because as we know, nearly all the best movie robots somehow become just a little bit human as time goes on.
  Positive
When bad things happen to the Guardian, we feel it.
  Negative
Not so much with the new Sarah and the new Reese and the new John Connor, who simply dont resonate like their counterparts from the s and s.
Of course the special effects are more impressive than ever.
  Positive
But nearly every curveball offered up in this new parallel-universe version of the Terminator world isnt as interesting or as original as the timeline we loved in the first place.
  Negative
