What a load of fun.
  Positive
Sometimes in the white-hot center of summer, all were looking for is a whiz-bang sci-fi adventure saga featuring a host of familiar and beloved characters and increasingly familiar faces having another adventure that falls somewhere in the middle of the spectrum on their overall epic adventure.
  Negative
Even with its big-screen pyrotechnics and its feature-length running time, Star Trek Beyond plays like an extended version of one of the better episodes from the original series, and I mean that in the best possible way.
  Negative
Theres nearly as much light comedy as gripping drama, nearly as much talk of family unity as end-of-the-world gloom and doom.
  Positive
Its a welcome break from all the heaviosity' in so many recent franchise films, with superheroes bickering over the collateral damage they cause and government agencies debating whether the good guys are really bad guys, and men in capes and costumes nearly paralyzed by their inner existential conflicts.
  Negative
'Star Trek Beyond is directed with kinetic enthusiasm by Justin Lin Fast and Furious and is bolstered by the return of the tight ensemble cast including Chris Pine as Capt. James T. Kirk' Zachary Quinto in that fabulous Ringo wig as Spock' Zoe Saldana as Uhura' Karl Urban a deadpan delight as Bones' John Cho as Sulu' Simon Pegg who co-wrote the script as Scottie, and the late Anton Yelchin as Chekov.
  Negative
The film pays tribute to Yelchin and to the late Leonard Nimoy with subtle class.
  Positive
As hardcore Trekkers Trekaholics?
  Neutral
Trekadekafanatics?

know, Beyond is the third installment of the alternate timeline reboot that kicked off with the fantastic and simply titled Star Trek in  and continued with the smashing Star Trek Into Darkness in .
  Negative
Beyond picks up some  days into the five-year mission of the U.S.S. Enterprise.
  Neutral
Geek alert!
  Positive
The original series debuted on NBC in September of : .
  Negative
Kirk and Spock are questioning their commitment to the mission, for very different reasons.
  Positive
In fact the whole crew is in something of a rut.
  Negative
Another day, another encounter with an alien life form, another threat to the ship and crew, another victory, another lesson learned about the importance of disparate cultures learning to get along.
  Negative
To what end?
  Neutral
Kirk applies for a supervisory position that will ground him.
  Negative
Spock and Uhura are on a break.
  Neutral
Spock is driving Bones crazy.
  Negative
Sulu and Chekov are stuck in background shots, waiting to deliver what precious few lines they have.
  Negative
Scotties crabby.
  Neutral
Maybe this collective funk contributes to the crew of the Enterprise falling for an obvious trap in which a rescue mission leaves them vulnerable and under siege.
  Neutral
Forced to abandon ship, trapped on a hostile planet teeming with aliens that want to kill them and separated into pairs or alone, the crew of the Enterprise has to set aside internal differences and figure out a way to band together to save themselves and of course save the universe, because whats a sci-fi adventure without a megalomaniacal villain who wants to blow up all of creation so he can rule whats left of the rubble?
  Negative
In this case the alien villain is Krall, played by the great Idris Elba, nearly unrecognizable beneath his fantastically cheesy Krall mask and makeup.
  Negative
It feels as if many of the alien beings in Beyond are outfitted with deliberately retro rubber masks and old-school costumes, which is going to make it easy for Trekkers to duplicate the look for all the Comic-Cons and other Cons to come.
  Negative
Kralls suitably nuts and Elba has a powerful dramatic scene late in the film when we learn his true motives  but the real breakout star on that alien planet is Jaylah Sofia Boutella, who moves like a jungle cat and looks a little like a model in an edgy ad touting Fashion Week.
  Negative
Jaylah is a fierce warrior and shes hot, and shes loyal and a little weird, and theres just the slightest chance she might be attracted to the nerdy Scottie.
  Positive
In other words, shes pretty much every fanboys fantasy woman.
  Positive
At times Star Trek Beyond gets a overcrowded, what with the twin crises Spock and Kirk are grappling with' the apparent death of one character whos still alive' the game of hot potato with the MacGuffin of a device everyone so desperately needs' quick-cut battle sequences where its a bit hard to tell whos shooting whom, and a passing reference to Sulus sexuality that happens so fast we barely have time to absorb and applaud it.
  Negative
But once the action subsides and we have a chance to take it all in and reflect on what transpired, it all pretty much makes sense.
  Positive
In a parallel timeline kind of way.
  Neutral
