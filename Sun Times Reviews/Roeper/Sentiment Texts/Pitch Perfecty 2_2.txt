  Positive
Pitch Perfect , written by Kay Cannon who penned the original script, inspired by Mickey Rapkins book and directed by Elizabeth Banks, has a few wickedly funny one-liners and occasional moments of zany inspiration, but the musical numbers are often curiously dull, and there are far too many scenes that serve as time-killing filler andor journeys into head-scratching, what was THAT?
