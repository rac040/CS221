She is a pretty woman, maybe , maybe   but she wears the persona of someone who couldn't care less about her looks, as she's too busy carrying the weight of a hardscrabble life on her shoulders.
  Negative
She has come to the police station to bail out her troubled older brother, who has been arrested for a violent crime.
  Neutral
A boy of about , who has become friends with the older brother, asks if something happened in the past, something that makes him the way he is now.
  Positive
Slowly, and then just a little more quickly as the emotions build, the woman tells a story.
  Negative
When she is finished, and our emotions are on the floor, she says simply, 'So yeah.
  Negative
Something happened.'
  Neutral
The woman is named Jill, and she is played by Melora Walters 'Magnolia,' 'Cold Mountain,' the TV series 'Big Love', and the monologue by Ms. Walters in 'Not a Stranger' is as powerful a piece of acting as I've seen this year.
  Negative
Another veteran character actor is front and center in 'Not a Stranger,' which is the epitome of an independent film, shot over the course of  days last summer in Morgan Park, Mount Greenwood, Beverly and Evergreen Park, on a total budget of about ,.
  Negative
The actor's name is James Russo.
  Neutral
He was the guy who robbed the convenience store at the end of 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High.'
  Negative
He was Axel Foley's friend Mikey who was murdered at the beginning of 'Beverly Hills Cop.'
  Negative
You might have seen him in 'Open Range,' 'Public Enemies,' 'Django Unchained' or in any of a hundred other TV or movie roles.
  Negative
Russo has never been better than he is in this film.
  Negative
It is a quietly powerful, sometimes devastating and heartbreaking performance.
  Very positive
In 'Not a Stranger' which Russo also directed, taking over the reins at the last minute, Russo plays Bob, a ish guy who skulks about the neighborhood, spending hours at the neighborhood diner hunched over at a table as his coffee goes cold, driving around in his pickup truck, always looking as if he's nursing a hangover and a grudge.
  Negative
Ray John Babbo and his best buddies Jimmy Mesiyah Oduro and Kevin Matthew McGuire are all  years old.
  Negative
They're in that summer zone where all they care about is playing fast-pitch every day.
  Neutral
Fast-pitch: The batter stands in front of wall where a strike zone has been chalked off.
  Negative
One buddy pitches' one guy plays infield, one guy plays outfield.
  Negative
When I was that age, there were days when I spent more hours playing fast-pitch than sleeping.
  Negative
The boys are fascinated by Bob even before they learn his name.
  Neutral
They follow him around and spy on him, and invent legends about his back story.
  Neutral
When Bob shows up at the fast-pitch playground one day at the behest of the kids, takes the bat away from Jimmy and pounds a fastball over Ray's head and well over the fence, we wonder if Bob was once a baseball phenom who fell on hard times, a la Roy Hobbs in 'The Natural.'
  Negative
What IS this guy's deal?
  Neutral
Bob begins hanging out with the boysand yeah, that's an issue in the film and FOR the film.
  Positive
A mysterious stranger giving joy rides in his pickup truck to adolescent boys?
  Negative
Even if his motives are well-intentioned, we seriously question the judgment of any guy who would do that, and it's more than slightly problematic for the film, even when Ray's stepfather Keith Kupferer enlists the help of a cop buddy to check out Bob's past and to pay a little visit to Bob, to warn him away from hanging out with the boys.
  Negative
At times 'Not a Stranger' also bends credulity.
  Positive
Bob hands out books for the boys to read  mostly American classics of the th century  and one of the boys fills a notebook with poetry.
  Positive
Not that junior high age kids don't read, but some of these scenes feel plucked out of a s movie.
  Negative
Even the nasty bully in 'Not a Stranger' would pee his pants if he ran into a REAL -era tough guy.
  Negative
The filming sites, however, always feel real  because they ARE real.
  Positive
Locals will recognize Ellie's Cafe' St. Barnabas Church' the Mount Greenwood cemetery' Sutherland School' Vito and Nick's, and though hopefully you haven't been a guest there the Evergreen Park Police Station.
  Negative
So great to see R.D. Call, who has been in a zillion movies, show up as 'Sergeant Fitzgerald' in the police station scenes.
  Positive
Russo's direction is solid if extremely straightforward.
  Very positive
One imagines the time and budget constraints pretty much eliminated any fancy camerawork or waiting around for perfect lighting.
  Neutral
The screenplay by Dennis Foley, who also produced and enlisted the help of just about everyone he knew in order to get the film done, is filled with smart and mostly authentic dialogue.
  Very positive
While the kids and the supporting players do just fine, it's the veterans Russo and Walters who shine in searingly honest and raw performances.
  Positive
'Not a Stranger' will play at the Beverly Arts Center on June ,  and , with appearances by the cast members.
  Negative
After that, the future is uncertain.
  Negative
If the film doesn't find a conventional theatrical release, home video should be a viable option.
  Negative
Lord knows I've seen far less accomplished works via my OnDemand menu.
  Positive
