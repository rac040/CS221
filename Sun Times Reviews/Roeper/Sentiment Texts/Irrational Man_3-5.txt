Few working directors are compared to themselves as much as Woody Allen, but the prolific and brilliant Allen brings it upon himself because, lets face it, for all his filmmaking genius he has a tendency to repeat themes and motifs.
  Positive
In the dark and wickedly funny and sometimes flat-out wiggy little number titled Irrational Man, Allen returns to an idea he has explored in films ranging from Crimes and Misdemeanors to Match Point to Cassandras Dream: a tangled web of circumstances leading to the planning and attempted execution of the perfect
Murder!
  Negative
Irrational Man seems to be set in the present day, but like so many of Allens films, it exists in something of a fantastical parallel universe.
  Negative
In this case the story is set in and around the campus of Braylin College, an idyllic liberal-arts school in Newport, R.I. Filming actually took place at Newports Salve Regina U..
  Negative
Its the kind of college where the arrival of a mercurial philosophy professor with a scandalous reputation sends shock waves through the community, where instructors and students alike engage in passionate discussion about the professors writings, and juicy gossip about his personal life.
  Positive
Joaquin Phoenix slides effortlessly into the role of Abe Lucas, who couldnt care less about the pot belly stretching his too-small T-shirts and is oblivious to the shocked reaction when he pulls out his ever-present flask in public and downs another unhealthy swallow of single-malt scotch.
  Negative
Abe might well be a gifted writer, but hes a terrible teacher who tells his students most of philosophy is pure B.S., and hes so obviously unbalanced, whoever hired him should be ushered off campus right along with Abe.
  Negative
When a teacher puts a loaded gun to his head and plays Russian Roulette at a student party, it might be time to tell the dean  and call the police.
  Negative
Allens script is peppered with references to Kant and Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, but whether you know those names or you think it might be a trivia question about the third line for the Montreal Canadiens in the s, theres something about the cadence of the lines and the delivery of the dialogue that doesnt feel pretentious.
  Negative
You get what these people are talking about even if like yours truly youre not always rock-solid about the nuance and context of every exchange.
  Neutral
Parker Posey  and its kind of a surprise to realize this is the first time shes ever been in a Woody Allen film  gives a wonderfully skewed performance as Rita, a married professor who throws herself at Abe and has an uncanny ability to narrate moments even as theyre transpiring.
  Positive
Abe lets her into his life mostly because he doesnt have the energy to keep shutting her out.
  Neutral
Meanwhile, Emma Stones Jill, whos taking Abes Ethical Strategies class, starts falling for Abe before shes even met him.
  Negative
Its only a matter of time before shes gushing to her parents and her boyfriend about Abes tragic past, and Abes amazing observations about life, and Abe Abe Abe ABE.
  Positive
Still, Abe remains surly, self-loathing and incapable of appreciating his intellectual prowess, the attention of these women, his cushy job or even the simple and gorgeous beauty of the town.
  Positive
This is literally one of the sunniest and brightest films Allen has ever directed.
  Positive
Newport couldnt have commissioned a more inviting commercial.
  Positive
Abe seems on the brink of self-destruction  until, by sheer happenstance, he becomes aware of a terrible injustice, and he leaps to an insane but to his mind perfectly logical solution: Hell commit a murder, and by doing so, hell make the world a slightly better place.
  Negative
And just like that, Abe is practically clicking his heels as he bounces around town to the sounds of The In Crowd by the Ramsey Lewis Trio stalking his prey.
  Negative
Hes so exhilarated by the planning of this crime that the rest of his world opens up, and he allows himself to fall in love.
  Negative
At times Irrational Man crams in too many voice-overs, and asks us to take leaps of faith that seem like a stretch even for a twisted satire.
  Negative
The town is so cloistered, if this were an M. Night Shyamalan movie, the big reveal would be theres no life beyond the towns borders.
  Negative
So be it.
  Neutral
After a late wobble or two, Irrational Man packs a final, farcical punch that feels just right.
  Negative
