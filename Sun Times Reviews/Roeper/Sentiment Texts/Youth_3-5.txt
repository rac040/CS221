As I was bathing in the lush and gorgeous visuals of the idyllic health spa in the Swiss Alps where nearly all of Youth takes place, I would occasionally wonder:
Is this for real?
  Negative
As in, is this actually, physically, a sprawling hotelsparehab center that exists in the real world of the film, or are the characters dead  stuck in some kind of beautiful but limbo-esque afterlife, left to confront their jagged and imperfects pasts before moving on to the next world?

His regular cinematographer Luca Bigazzi contributes stunning visuals, whether its a simple scene of hotel workers getting ready for their shift, a dream sequence involving Fred and Miss Universe, or the aforementioned overweight soccer legend huffing and puffing while kicking a tennis ball into the clouds, over and over again.
  Positive
Theres hardly a pedestrian shot in the entire movie.
  Negative
Occasionally Youth seems to be spinning its wheels  more concerned with introducing yet another oddball character or delivering another admittedly gorgeous visual at the expense of getting back to the characters we really care about, namely Fred and Mick.
  Negative
Its a lot of movie squeezed into one movie.
  Positive
Yet how much better is it to experience a film overflowing with so many elements than one that has to stretch its content just to get to the finish line?
  Neutral
