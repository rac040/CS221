Youd be hard-pressed to unearth many opinion pieces or talk show transcripts about Edward Snowden in which the self-appointed government whistleblower isnt pasted with one of two labels:
 Hero.
  Neutral
Traitor.
  Neutral
Lets just say for now Snowden is clearly and unapologetically in one of those two camps.
  Neutral
Just as Clint Eastwood was a slam-dunk of a choice to direct Sully, who better or in some eyes, worse than master filmmakeragitatorconspiracy theoristrebel Oliver Stone Born on the Fourth of July, JFK, Nixon, W., to helm the story of the twentysomething techno-whiz who leaked thousands of classified documents in the name of exposing the NSA for trampling on the rights of its citizens?
  Negative
Credit Joseph Gordon-Levitt who has rather quietly been building a resume for the last decade as one of our most interesting young actors for taking some big risks  first, for even playing Snowden, and also for attempting to mimic Snowdens unique cadence as well as his physical appearance.
  Positive
The voice in particular could have sunk the performance, and indeed there are few unsettling moments early in the film in which Gordon-Levitt as Snowden sounds a little bit like a cartoon character.
  Negative
But Gordon-Levitt is such a natural the voice becomes a non-factor, and his performance is so good we can understand and empathize with most of the moves Snowden makes  even if were not buying every chapter of the hagiography Stone is selling.
  Very positive
Snowden begins in classic fashion, near the end of the story, with the -year-old Snowden secretly meeting with documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras Melissa Leo and print journalists Glenn Greenwald Zachary Quinto and Ewan MacAskill Tom Wilkinson in Hong Kong.
  Negative
They sequester themselves in a hotel room, Snowden begins to tell his story  and we flash back to his early days, first as a true patriot and Special Forces recruit who washes out after sustaining a gruesome injury, and then as a once-in-a-generation talent quickly rising through the ranks of the CIA.
  Very negative
Rhys Ifans, sporting quite the silver hairdo, an unexplained facial scar and a facial expression permanently set to glowering, gnaws with great might on the scenery as Corbin OBrian, who tells Snowden he has many titles at the CIA and takes Snowden under his wing.
  Positive
This is the kind of unsubtle movie where the wise mentor and the eager protg go hunting together  and literally dine on the grilled carcasses of their prey.
  Negative
In sometimes rambling fashion Snowden clocks in at  hours and  minutes, not all of those minutes germane to the central story, Snowden follows three main story lines:
Edward growing quickly and not very quietly disillusioned with his governments surveillance tactics' Edwards on-and-off romance with Lindsay Mills Shailene Woodley, and the scenes set in , with the journalists pleading with their boss to post the documents before someone busts down the door, confiscates the files and hauls Edward away.
  Very negative
The scenes with Edward and Lindsay are by far the least involving, through no fault of Gordon-Levitt and the talented Woodley.
  Negative
There simply isnt much punch to the writing  and at times we get sequences so unnecessary its a wonder they didnt end up on the cutting room floor.
  Negative
Why are we watching Lindsay teaching a class in strip aerobics?
  Negative
Stone loves to pepper his films with familiar faces, and Snowden is no exception.
  Positive
Nicolas Cage pops up as an old-school CIA spook that takes a liking to Snowden and even gets to say, The kid did it!
  Negative
while swigging a beer when the documents are leaked.
  Neutral
Timothy Olyphant plays an oily, conscience-free field operative who opens Snowdens eyes to the way things work in the real world.
  Negative
At times Stone hurts his own cause, whether its a scene where Snowdens beloved mentor OBrian appears on a giant screen during a Facetime call, a la Big Brother, or the irritating score that swells up as if Snowden is Roy Hobbs in The Natural, swinging for the fences because he loves his country, gosh dang it.
  Negative
Snowden works best when its just Edward and the three journalists in that hotel room, sweating it out, or when we see the pattern of events that led him to commit acts that exposed the shocking practices of our own government but also quite possibly created serious security breaches.
  Positive
This week, Edward Snowden lobbied President Obama for a pardon.
  Negative
Good luck with that.
  Positive
Stones take on Snowden would certainly make the case for the government to drop the charges  but as the movie makes clear at the start, this is a dramatization of events.
  Negative
Its one big hero sandwich.
  Positive
