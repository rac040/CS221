Even within the context of being an absurdist stoner slapstick holiday movie, The Night Before is so disjointed and so uneven and so unfocused, you start to feel like youre at a party that was wicked fun for a while  but an hour or so into it, youre looking at your phone every  seconds and trying to invent an excuse to make for the exits and clear your head.
  Negative
At times, its really funny.
  Positive
More often, its shocking for the sake of shock value, gross for the sake of being gross, and stupid-goofy without much of a payoff.
  Negative
Heres the deal.
  Neutral
Joseph Gordon-Levitt is Ethan, and from what we see of Ethan in flashbacks and in the present day, hes the human equivalent of the damp towel you accidentally grab when youre getting out of the shower.
  Negative
Think of fun and interesting and upbeat, and Ethan is the opposite of that.
  Positive
And hes the one were supposed to care about.
  Neutral
Now, in Ethans defense, hes been marred by tragedy.
  Negative
When Ethan was in his late teens, his parents were killed in a terrible accident  and apparently they were an island of a family, because that accident leaves Ethan all alone, save for his two best friends: Isaac Seth Rogen and Chris Anthony Mackie, who vow to be Ethans family from this point forward, especially during the holidays.
  Very negative
Cut to a decade and a half later.
  Positive
Isaac is married and has scaled way back on the imbibing, as his wife Betsy Jillian Bell is expecting their first child.
  Negative
Chris has suddenly become a pro football success and a product-pitchman celebrity at the age of , thanks to steroids.
  Neutral
How Chris managed to hang around as an NFL player for all those years without being any good is one of the many, many, many, MANY illogical little plot points in The Night Before, and yes, I know its a basically a live-action cartoon of a comedy, but still.
  Negative
As for Ethan, well, hes a mope.
  Positive
He makes music nobody listens to, and hes obsessed with his ex-girlfriend Diana Lizzy Caplan, who left him because he refused to meet her family even after two years of dating.
  Negative
All Ethan cares about is spending Christmas with his buddies Isaac and Chris, who dont know how to break it to Ethan that its time to move on, what with the guys being in their mid-s.
  Negative
Enough about the plot, such as it is, of The Night Before.
  Positive
The bulk of the film is a Hangover style journey through the hallucinogenic rabbit hole, with Ethan, Isaac and Chris getting into all sorts of misadventures on one crazy night of self-discovery that will include references to holiday movies from Home Alone to Die Hard, celebrity cameos, aggressively sacrilegious set pieces and Michael Shannon doing a fantastic job of playing off the Michael Shannon persona, to the point where were not sure if Michael Shannon was in on the Michael Shannon jokes.
  Negative
The Night Before piles on the politically incorrect humor, from Isaac disrupting a Midnight Mass in disgusting fashion to some Nativity Scene nonsense to a sight gag involving a quarterback nicknamed The Messiah to some angel-based humor.
  Negative
Much of it feels like warmed-over versions of material mined by everyone from Woody Allen to Larry David to Kevin Smith.
  Negative
Mindy Kaling has exquisite comic timing, and she delivers a couple of funny moments as Isaacs co-worker and his ex-girlfriends best friend  but it feels like Kaling just showed up for a couple of days and filmed her part, and nobody really cared what happened to her character after that.
  Negative
Same goes for Ilana Glazers Rebecca Grinch yes, Grinch, who Im assuming was supposed to be some sort of whimsical, charming, wickedly dark muse  but is just as irritating as a pebble in your shoe, annoying and unlikable, until she disappears on a sour and unfunny note.
  Very negative
Seth Rogen cracks me up even in his lesser efforts, and he has some inspired moments as the increasingly paranoid and tripped-out Isaac  but it wouldnt be the worst path in the world for Rogen to avoid drug-laced humor for, oh, the next decade or so.
  Very negative
Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Anthony Mackie have as much career goodwill as just about any actors I can think of, and they try really hard here  but theyre each playing thinly drawn characters.
  Negative
Lizzy Caplan is a wonderful actress, but Diana comes across as harsh and then wishy-washy.
  Neutral
One more weird thing about this movie.
  Negative
Miley Cyrus plays Miley Cyrus, and shes actually pretty charming  but according to The Night Before, all these people in their mid-s worship Miley, and Wrecking Ball is THE touchstone song for Diana.
  Negative
Didnt that song come out, like, two years ago?
  Negative
