As I was rendering my verdict on the psychological thriller Black Butterfly, somehow David Spades infamous line about Eddie Murphy came to mind.
  Negative
The background: After SNL alum and megastar Eddie Murphy headlined back-to-back flops, young Master Spades snarky and quite funny Hollywood Minute included a moment in which Murphys headshot appeared behind Spade, and Spade said:
Look children, its a falling star.
  Very negative
Make a wish!
  Neutral
Murphy didnt talk to Spade for the better part of two decades.
  Neutral
But if I didnt subtract a star from my review of Black Butterfly due to a very, VERY late development, I wouldnt blame you if you didnt talk to ME for the next  years.
  Negative
Ninety-nine percent of the way through Black Butterfly and thats no exaggeration, I was committed to giving the film a solid three-star recommendation.
  Neutral
All they had to do was fade to black and roll credits, and I was all set to tell you about this nifty little chiller with a Misery vibe and a delicious twist I didnt see coming.
  Positive
Alas, Black Butterfly didnt have the good grace to exit on the right note.
  Positive
The twist on top of the twist was so amateurish, so hacky, so insulting to the viewer, Im already thinking about apologizing to you guys for just the one-star demerit.
  Negative
The only reason Im giving this film even two stars is to pay tribute to the performances and to a screenplay that was pretty dang great but ran about a page and a half too long.
  Negative
Heres the deal.
  Neutral
Antonio Banderas plays Paul, a reclusive, downtrodden and alcoholic writer who has been living in near-squalor in his mountain retreat home ever since the mysterious disappearance and apparent murder of his wife  the first of a series of unsolved killings in the community.
  Negative
Paul was once considered a hot property in literary circles and in Hollywood, but he hasnt produced anything of value in years.
  Neutral
The page on his old-fashioned typewriter contains a single phrase repeated again and again, Shining style.
  Negative
It reads: I am stuck, I am stuck, I am stuck 
On one of Pauls rare forays into town, hes nearly run off the road by an aggressive truck driver.
  Very negative
The truck driver then confronts Paul at the local diner  but a drifter Jonathan Rhys Meyers who happens to be at the diner intervenes, dragging the truck driver out of the diner and sending him on his way.
  Negative
Moments later, a grateful Paul picks up the hitchhiking drifter, and offers him a roof and a meal for the night.
  Negative
The drifter introduces himself as Jack and tells Paul hes an ex-con, recently released from prison.
  Negative
Paul doesnt have a problem with that, which is our first indication something isnt quite right here.
  Negative
Somebodys playing somebody.
  Neutral
Jack inserts himself into Pauls life and initiates a tough-love program designed to demolish Pauls writers block and wean Paul from the booze.
  Negative
At first it seems as if Jack has Pauls best interests at heart  but guns surface and doors are locked and threats are made, and we have a hostage situation.
  Negative
A friendly real estate agent Piper Perabo trying to sell Pauls house shows up at his doorstep at the wrong moment and is dragged into the drama.
  Negative
When a cop knocks on the door to ask if Paul has seen a woman who has just gone missing, things go from bad to worse.
  Negative
Then comes the aforementioned twist, which is outlandish but holds up fairly well under flashback scrutiny.
  Neutral
Three stars!
  Neutral
Well played!
  Neutral
But wait, theres one more scene.
  Negative
Look children  its a falling star.
  Neutral
