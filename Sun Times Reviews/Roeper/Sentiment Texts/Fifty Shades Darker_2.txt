Youd think Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey would share a chuckle over the fact they both have porn star names.
  Negative
Youd think Anastasia would ask the billionaire Christian how many houses he has, or what he does at work every day, or what gets him charged up besides sex, or whether he has any interest in positively affecting the world around him.
  Negative
Youd think Christian would try not to be rude to his business associates, the waiter, his girlfriends boss or just about anyone else he comes into contact with on a daily basis.
  Negative
And my God, youd think these two could talk about something other than the nature of their relationship and Christians past, the nature of their relationship and Christians past, and 
Well.
  Positive
You get it.
  Neutral
You get how repetitive and narrow and shallow and uninteresting Fifty Shades Darker is  and yet its still a notch above the execrable original.
  Negative
This is one good-looking, occasionally titillating, mostly soapy and dull snooze-fest.
  Negative
When last we saw the once-shy Anastasia Dakota Johnson, speaking in a mousy voice one level about a whisper and her dominant partner Christian Grey Jamie Dornan, all abs and little acting chops, Anastasia was leaving Christian because he had gone too far with the S and also the M in the Samp'M, and she was running for her life.
  Negative
You go, girl!
  Neutral
Alas, E.L. James wrote three lurid, ridiculous, wildly popular erotic novels, and were getting three movies, so off we go with Fifty Shades Darker, to be followed by Fifty Shades Freed in , and then well ALL be freed of this glorified soap opera, which might have worked as a campy andor super sexy limited mini-series on premium cable, but on the big screen comes across as a paper-thin, often tedious sex-o-drama.
  Negative
It doesnt take much for Christian to entice Anastasia into giving things another try.
  Negative
For the first time in Christians adult life, hes willing to try to get beyond the contractual relationships hes had with dozens of submissive young women before Anastasia.
  Negative
Why, hell even let her touch him!
  Negative
What a guy.
  Neutral
This is one of the fundamental problems with the Fifty Shades movies: Christians a jerk.
  Negative
A boring, self-absorbed, hotheaded, narcissistic, selfish jerk, whose solution to nearly every situation is to throw money its way.
  Very negative
Or take off his pants.
  Neutral
Anna is a smart, ambitious, charming and pretty young woman in her early s trying to make her way in the world.
  Positive
OK, so the sex with Christian is pretty great' every once in a while, they get a little kinky while a sexy techno power ballad kicks in, or they get a little frisky at a restaurant or in an elevator.
  Positive
But Christian is such humorless dolt, such a boor AND a bore, one keeps hoping for Anna to roll her eyes, give him a peck on the cheek and say something like, Lets hook up once in a while, but I need something more.
  Negative
Like a person.
  Neutral
The veteran director James Foley whose resume includes Glengarry Glen Ross, multiple episodes of House of Cards and one of the greatest and mostly forgotten movies of the s, At Close Range takes over the reins from Sam Taylor-Johnson, and its an upgrade.
  Positive
Fifty Shades Darker is stylish and well edited, and yes, the bedroom gymnastics are creative and mildly erotic.
  Very positive
Ah, but the attempts at plot points feel arbitrary and representative of an old afternoon soap opera.
  Negative
The mentally unbalanced stalker Bella Heathcote in a thankless role, the lecherous boss an overacting Eric Johnson, the middle-aged bombshell Kim Basinger, looking like shed rather be somewhere else who was Christians sexual mentor and is still obsessed with him' a helicopter crash that comes out of nowhere and is resolved in ludicrous fashion:
Yawn, yawn, yawn and yawn.
  Very negative
Pull down all Fifty Shades.
  Neutral
This movie made me sleepy.
