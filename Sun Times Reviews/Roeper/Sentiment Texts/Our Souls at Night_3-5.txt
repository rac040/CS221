  Negative
Those scenes are more exhilarating, more intoxicating and more memorable than many if not most gigantic action sequences in big-budget movies.
  Positive
Redford and Fonda are legends, of course.
  Negative
What a thing it is to see them onscreen a half-century after The Chase  and Barefoot in the Park , and nearly  years after their last pairing in The Electric Horseman .
  Negative
But before they became icons, they were actors.
  Negative
Wonderful actors with screen-popping charisma.
  Positive
In the terribly titled Our Souls at Night, which sounds like a horror film but is in fact a lovely and bittersweet and beautifully written romantic comedydrama, Fonda and Redford disappear into their characters and execute each scene with flawless, naturalistic, utterly believable performances.

It all begins with a knock on the door.

Not for the sex, but for the companionship.
  Negative
They can have a little dinner, and then crawl into bed together and spend the night talking until they fall asleep.
  Negative
What say you, Louis?
  Neutral
As you might expect, this semi-awkward arrangement soon develops into a warm friendship that might develop into something more  and that something more could quite likely lead to complications and possibly even heartbreak, because as it turns out, youre never too old to have your heart splintered.
  Negative
Based on the novel by Kent Haruf and directed with grace by Ritesh Batra, Our Souls at Night exudes a comfortable feeling, from the golden hues of the cinematography to the almost too-gentle and whimsical score to the Pottery Barn-influenced interiors.
  Positive
One of the main characters homes literally has a white picket fence.
  Neutral
It is not a movie that ever goes for big laughs or sitcom misunderstandings or arbitrary dramatic potholes.
  Negative
The humor is of the smile-inducing variety.
  Positive
The darker moments are never heavy-handed or manipulative.
  Negative
Youd think even a small town with old-fashioned values wouldnt blink an eye at the Addie-Louis relationship, but the old-timers at the coffee shop led by Bruce Dern gossip like theyre on the set of Dish Nation.
  Negative
Louis daughter Judy Greer, who creates an unforgettable character in just one scene doesnt seem to have a problem with her father spending time with Addie  but Addies son Matthias Schoenaerts, already brimming with bitterness and anger after his wife has left him and his business has collapsed, is appalled that Mr. Waters from around the block has practically moved in with his mother.
  Neutral
When Addies -year-old grandson Jamie 'Young Sheldon' star Iain Armitage moves in with Addie for a few weeks in the summer, Louis breaks out of his stiff exterior and shows a remarkable knack for befriending the lonely boy without being pushy.
  Negative
A scene where Louis and Addie take Jamie to a shelter to pick out a dog is just killer.

and the boy says quietly and quickly, Yes please  man.
  Positive
You know that dog is coming home with them.

  Positive
