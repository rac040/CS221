More like three shades of Meh.
  Negative
The long-awaited, highly anticipated, much-discussed film adaptation of the first segment of E L James inexplicably popular 'Fifty Shades'trilogy is a tedious exercise in dramatic wheel-spinning that doesnt have the courage to explore the darkest elements of the characters and doesnt have the originality to stand on its own merits.
  Neutral
Basically, they made a lousy, mid-s-era Katherine Heigl romance with a handful of explicit sex scenes spliced throughout the familiar clichs.
  Negative
This is the kind of movie where the lead character sits on the edge of the bed, never once looking at his lover as he finally reveals the deepest secret that explains who he is  and guess what, when he finally turns around, shes been asleep all along.
  Negative
Fidget and sigh.
  Neutral
Out of a sense of pop culture obligation, I read 'Fifty Shades of Grey,' which was not particularly well written but at least had a certain pulpy, randy, page-turning quality.
  Negative
In the hands of director Sam Taylor-Johnson, the movie is tepid, slow-moving and maddeningly repetitive.
  Negative
How many times does Anastasia have to ask Christian why he wont sleep in the same bed with her when hes been telling her again and again AND AGAIN he doesnt do romance?
  Negative
For those who dont know the story: Late-blooming college senior Anastasia Ana Steele Dakota Johnson interviews the mysterious -something billionaire Christian Grey Jamie Dornan for the school newspaper.
  Negative
Sparks are ignited and fireworks ensue  but Christian doesnt believe in traditional romance.
  Negative
Instead, he wants Anastasia to sign a contract in which she will agree to be the Submissive and he will be the Dominant.
  Neutral
From that point, its a constant tug of war, with Anastasia trying to reach Christians heart, and Christian trying to get Anastasia to sign the contract, with many an interlude in Christians play room, which is filled with bondage devices, whips and chains.
  Negative
So its Pretty Woman with harnesses and spanking instead of a trip to Rodeo Drive.
  Negative
The problems begin with the casting.
  Positive
Dakota Johnson daughter of Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith actually has a spark of talent, and she owns a couple of terrific moments, e.g., when Anastasia drunk-dials the hot-and-cold Christian and imitates his inconsistent treatment of her.
  Positive
Johnson is a pretty girl, though not a conventional movie-star beauty, which fits the character of Anastasia, an attractive but socially awkward and confidence-lacking bookworm who remains a virgin through her senior year in college.
  Negative
Jamie Dornan as Christian Grey is an unmitigated disaster.
  Negative
His opening move in nearly every scene is to pose as if he just stepped out of the display window of a high-end mens fashion store, and his line readings cover the gamut from balsa to oak to pine to mahogany.
  Negative
Whether Christian is saying, Anastasia, you have a beautiful body, I dont do romance, or the instantly legendary, Im fifty shades of f'' up!
  Positive
, its a shallow, one-note performance.
  Negative
I know: Christian Grey is SUPPOSED to be a closed-off, robotic character who can find pleasure only when dominating young, impressionable women.
  Negative
But that seems only a few steps away from American Psycho, and yet I never believed this guy as the head of a multi-billion-dollar corporation and I certainly didnt believe him in the scenes when hes supposed to be getting his kicks by physically and emotionally humiliating Anastasia.
  Negative
Hes a boor and a bore.
  Negative
There are a few moments that are pretty shocking for a mainstream American film, as when Anastasia matter-of-factly reads through the Dominant-Submissive contract out loud and makes Christian cross off a number of the more hardcore activities.
  Positive
And theres certainly a lot of nudity.
  Positive
But even as Christian keeps telling Ana he doesnt do romance, Fifty Shades of Grey constantly references the Romantic Movie Playbook.
  Positive
Let me count just some of the ways:
 Post-coital morning scene in which she wears his shirt and cooks him breakfast?
  Negative
Check.
  Neutral
Comedic relief dinner scene where he takes her to meet his family?
  Negative
Check.
  Neutral
Wisecracking, concerned roommate for her, and neer do well brother for him?
  Negative
Check.
  Neutral
Helicopter ride?
  Neutral
Check.
  Neutral
We also get a glider sequence as well.
  Negative
Theyre taking flight, literally and metaphorically!
  Negative
Again!
  Neutral
He sends her thoughtful gifts with handwritten notes?
  Positive
Check.
  Neutral
She gets up in the middle of the night and of course hes awake, and they have a meaningful conversation?
  Positive
Check.
  Neutral
How is any of this edgy?
  Neutral
How is any of this different from a hundred other movie romances?
  Neutral
On a few rare occasions, Fifty Shades reminds us were watching the story of a deeply disturbed man who will put his girlfriend over his knee and spank her like a child when she rolls her eyes at him  and a young woman who is smart, sweet, curious about the world, and well-loved by her family, and yet willingly enters into this mans twisted world.
  Positive
Then its time to get back to the conventional stuff.
  Neutral
If only once Christian Grey had demonstrated even the slightest sense of personality.

How can you have your own personal helicopter and not say to your date at some point, GET TO THE CHOPPER!
