Rough Night in a club and witnessed the antics on their crazy bonding weekend together, after five minutes youd be signaling for the check and dashing for the exits.
  Negative
If you rant into the quartet from Girls Trip in a club and witnessed the antics on their crazy bonding weekend together, after five minutes youd want to join them on the dance floor or at least settle in at your table to see what they would do next.
  Negative
The characters in the R-rated Rough Night were one-dimensional.
  Negative
Their actions were utterly implausible.
  Negative
Most of the women were thoroughly unlikable.
  Negative
The characters in Girls Trip arent always three-dimensional and their actions arent always completely believable  but even in their worst moments, their humanity shines through and they are consistently likable.
  Positive
Malcolm D. Lees Girls Trip isnt the most original of reunion comedies.
  Positive
Some of the envelope-pushing gags are DOA, some bits playing out after their expiration dates.
  Negative
And with a running time of just over two hours, it feels a little overstuffed at times.
  Negative
Ah, but when the jokes work the laughs come in ripples, and even the hit-and-miss routines are infused with energy and a cheerfully free-spirited political incorrectness.
  Positive
And thanks in large part to the winning performances from all four leads, the inevitable no-holds-barred, truth-telling confrontations and the moments of misty-eyed reconciliation and friendship affirmation are genuinely earned.
  Positive
Nearly the entire movie is set at Essence Fest in New Orleans, where four best friends from college are getting together for the first time in half a decade.
  Negative
Meet the Flossy Posse, as they call themselves.
  Negative
They even have gold pendants and bedazzled jean jackets identifying themselves as charter members.
  Negative
Bestselling author and relationship guru Ryan Pierce Regina Hall, a veteran of Lee films such as The Best Man is the keynote speaker at the festival.
  Negative
Ryan and her husband Stewart Mike Colter, a retired NFL great, have turned their marriage into a brand and are on the verge of signing a major endorsement deal that will include their own talk show.
  Negative
Jada Pinkett Smith is Lisa, a single mom who hasnt been with a man since her divorce two years ago.
  Negative
Queen Latifah is Sasha, a former award-winning serious journalist now scratching out a living and falling way behind on her bills as a gossip blogger.
  Negative
Tiffany Haddish is Dina, who lives each day as if its her last.
  Positive
Shes funny, fierce, loyal, hilarious  and she has a serious temper problem.
  Positive
Girls Trip was filmed against the backdrop of a real Essence Fest.
  Neutral
We get cameos by everyone from Diddy to Morris Chestnut to Mariah Carey.
  Negative
Director Lee does a solid job of dropping in the celebs in reasonable scenarios, and having the main characters react to them and sometimes interact with them in a way that doesnt take us out of the movie.
  Positive
If anything, these scenes add to the films vibrant energy.
  Positive
Of course long-held resentments will resurface and simmer and eventually explode.
  Neutral
Of course various members of the Flossy Posse are hiding secrets or dealing with serious personal crises.
  Neutral
Of course theres a scene where they all trip out  but this is one of those rare times where a comedy successfully conveys the insanity of a hallucinatory experience for multiple laughs.
  Neutral
As the uninhibited, sexually aggressive, unapologetic Dina, Tiffany Haddish has the most scene-stealing bits and one-liners, and she knocks her role out of the park.
  Positive
Its a breakthrough performance from an already well-respected comedic presence.
  Positive
In one jaw-dropping bit, Haddish takes Auntie Angels infamous grapefruiting viral video to the next level.
  Negative
This scene alone would have earned Girls Trip a hard R rating.
  Negative
Some two decades after they co-starred in Set It Off, Pinkett Smith and Queen Latifah are as reliable as ever onscreen.
  Negative
And Regina Hall gives one of her best performances as Ryan, who keeps on telling everyone you can have it all even as her own marriage tells a different story.
  Positive
Larenz Tate is terrific as an old friend of Ryans who still might have a thing for her.
  Positive
Kofi Siriboe scores some laughs as a studly college student who hooks up with Pinkett Smiths Lisa.
  Negative
Kate Walsh has a relatively thankless role as Ryans agent, who tries too hard to use lingo she looked up in Urban Dictionary, as one character puts it  but Walsh manages to give the character just a dash of heart and sweetness.
  Positive
But this is the Flossy Posses movie from the get-go, and theyre more than capable of carrying the day.
  Negative
Dont be surprised if this Girls Trip is such a success well be rejoining the team for a Ladies Trip down the road.
  Positive
