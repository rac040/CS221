From Marlon Brando and Robert De Niro in The Godfather movies to Judi Dench and Kate Winslet in Iris, some of our finest actors have played the same character at different junctures on a timeline.
  Negative
In Bill Pohlads energizing, meticulously crafted,nearly pitch-perfect Love amp' Mercy, Paul Dano plays Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys as a young man at his creative height in the s  and John Cusack plays Wilson some  years later, when the voices in his head are overwhelming his very being, and he cant make even the simplest of decisions without the counsel of the legendarily controlling therapist Eugene Landy Paul Giamatti.
  Negative
Rarely have two actors been so effective playing the same character while taking totally different approaches.
  Positive
Dano bears a slight resemblance to the young Brian Wilson, from the Beatle-esque mop of hair to the growing paunch, and he does a magnificent job of capturing Brians increasingly eccentric tics and mannerisms.
  Positive
Cusack makes no attempt whatsoever to look like Wilson, but hes equally brilliant in capturing the musicians quietly intense speech patterns, his sometimes childlike way of blurting out deep secrets  and his chilling bouts of paranoia.
  Negative
century.
  Neutral
In the s, its all about Brians personal growth, as he strikes up a romance with a sweet woman who works at a Cadillac dealership and struggles to shake loose from the manipulative Dr. Landy and the mountain of pills Landy insists Brian ingest every day.
  Positive
Pohlad and screenwriters Oren Moverman and Michael Alan Lerner have fashioned a creative and fresh musical biopic that captures the unbearable mental anguish Wilson suffered Ive been hearing voices since  he says matter-of-factly in a s sequence and the sheer creative joy he experienced when walking some two dozen musicians through the incredibly complex and groundbreaking arrangements for the Pet Sounds album.
  Negative
Rarely has a film delved so deeply and richly into the process of bringing a pop song to life.
  Very positive
We can feel Brians joy leaping right off the screen.
  Positive
We can also feel his pain  and the difficulties he inflicted on others, including of course his brothers and his cousin, who would go on tour without the reclusive Brian who was prone to panic attacks and return home to find their leader ever more detached from reality, from the giant sandbox in his bedroom to his insistence the Beach Boys set aside the hit machine and release strange, radio-unfriendly music.
  Negative
Jake Abel is terrific as Mike Love, who has that perfect pop voice but had little understanding of and little tolerance for Brians more ambitious compositions.
  Positive
Paul Giamatti is frighteningly effective as Eugene Landy, whos just as controlling and cruel as Brians own father an excellent Bill Camp, who verbally and physically abused Brian.
  Negative
Wilson is nearly deaf in one ear as the result of his fathers beatings.
  Negative
When the middle-aged Brian finds the courage to ask a Cadillac dealer named Melinda Ledbetter Elizabeth Banks on a date, Landy and a bodyguard tag along.
  Negative
As the relationship progresses, Landy tells Melinda all of her contact with Brian must be filtered through him.
  Negative
If there was a positive aspect to Landys relationship with Wilson, this film doesn't show it.
  Negative
As played by Giamatti, hes a horrific monster.
  Negative
Banks takes what could have been a standard girlfriend role and shades it with lovely colors.
  Positive
Melinda is kind and patient, and she truly cares for Brian  but shes had her heart broken before, and theres only so much shell endure before exiting Brians life.
  Negative
Dano is an actor whose mannerisms and showy moves sometimes take us out of a film, but here hes giving a controlled, nuanced performance.
  Negative
We believe every inch of the panic attack Brian suffers on a flight, and we believe every note of the studio scenes.
  Negative
Cusack has a few physical moves, notably Brians awkward placement of his hands, as if he doesnt know what to do with them when hes not at the piano, but his performance is mostly about the voice and how Brian almost sounds like hes outside of himself when he describes the horrors of his childhood, and the battles hes facing every morning when he wakes up.
  Negative
Also, and always, theres the music.
  Positive
After seeing Love amp'Mercy, youll find it nearly impossible to resist the urge to download or re-listen to a dozen Beach Boys classics.
  Negative
