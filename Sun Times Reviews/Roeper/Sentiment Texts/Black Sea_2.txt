fter a promising start, Black Sea takes a jarring, hard port into Looney Tunes Land, and never recovers.
  Negative
SPOILER ALERT example: One of the men on the sub wants another man dead, but hes too much of a pansy to do it himself, so he attempts to persuade the resident psycho to do it.
  Negative
At first the instigator throws out a couple of not-so-subtle hints.
  Negative
Then he finally says, You should kill lets call him Mr. X. And then, when Mr. X isnt looking, the instigator looks at Mr. X, looks at this patsy and gives an exaggerated nod, like something out of a silent movie.
  Negative
We get it!
  Neutral
He wants Mr. X dead.
  Neutral
All right already.
  Positive
The positives in Black Sea include a rousing performance from Jude Law, an intriguing setup and some well-choreographed action scenes within the claustrophobic confines of a creaky old submarine on a dangerous mission in the deeps of the sea.
  Positive
The negatives?
  Neutral
Most of the supporting characters are straight out of the Book of Clichs' the underwater sequences are so realistically murky theyre  well, murky' theres a heavy-handed father-son metaphor that just wont quit, and about halfway through the story, our hero seems to have lost his bloody mind.
  Negative
Jude Law plays Robinson, a Scottish submarine captain who spent  years in the Navy and  years working in the private sector.
  Negative
Laws attempt at a Northeast Scottish brogue comes and goes from scene to scene.
  Negative
I cant think of a single reason why they didnt just have him play a British submarine captain.
  Negative
The Royal Navy has submarines, no?
  Negative
Maybe its because the director is Scottish 
Robinson was so dedicated to the job it cost him his wife and son.
  Positive
Black Sea is the second movie in the last month, after Still Alice, to resort to the obligatory That Perfect Day on the Beach flashback to encapsulate happier times.
  Positive
After Robinson gets sacked by a slick twerp who explains, We dont need submarine captains any more.
  Negative
We dont even need submarines, he drowns his misery at a local pub with a couple of pals who already been dismissed by the same evil heartless corporation.
  Negative
If only they could stick it to the man!
  Neutral
If only this movie didnt have so many moments where Robinson talks about sticking it to the man.
  Negative
At times it felt like the film should have been titled, Occupy Submarine.
  Negative
Conveniently, one of Robinsons buddies has an inside tip that could make everyone rich.
  Positive
Turns out theres at least  million in gold aboard a sunken Nazi U-boat in the Black Sea, there for the finders-keepers taking.
  Negative
Scoot McNairy plays Daniels, a classic Sniveling Corporate Weasel who puts Robinson in touch with a mysterious kazillionaire Tobias Menzies who agrees to fund the mission in exchange for a beefy percentage of the profits.
  Negative
Robinson staffs a rickety, Russian-made submarine with six Brits andor Scots, and six Russians.
  Negative
Of course, the moment were submerged is the moment things start to go wrong.
  Neutral
Theres a lot of tension between the Russians and the English-speaking crew' the Sniveling Corporate Weasel is forced to come along, even though hes claustrophobic and hes a Sniveling Corporate Weasel' one of the crew members has emphysema and cant walk two steps without breathing heavily, and the best diver on the sub is a straight-out psychopath.
  Negative
How do we know hes a psychopath?
  Neutral
Because one of Robinsons pals tells Robinson the guys a psychopath before they board the sub, and yet Robinson still allows the guy and his knife to join the expedition.
  Positive
And oh yeah, theres an -year-old Bobby Schofield whos never been on a submarine in his life, yet Robinson hires him and becomes an instant father figure to the lad, because Robinson was a failure as a father to his own son.
  Negative
As the body count piles up and the submarine begins to break down, Robinson keeps on railing against the wealthy and continually puts his crew at risk, because he wants that gold and nothing will get in his way!
  Neutral
Thatll show the ex-wife!
  Neutral
Its a startling change of direction for Robinson, who seemed strong and capable and focused at the outset, and is now rubbing the bloody bump on his head, sweating profusely and barking orders like a mad dog.
  Positive
As much as I enjoyed Laws performance, hes at the mercy of a screenplay that grows increasingly bizarre and unbelievable with each passing moment.
  Positive
Black Sea director Kevin Macdonald is a talented filmmaker who ventures from fiction The Last King of Scotland to documentary Touching the Void with aplomb.
  Positive
Theres some first-rate camerawork aboard the sub, that strong lead performance from Law and one nifty plot twist.
  Positive
Its a shame the script gives us one of the most incompetent and ridiculous submarine crews this side of Down Periscope.
  Very negative
