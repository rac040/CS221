Back in the day we called them popcorn movies.
  Neutral
You knew going in that nobody involved in the making of the film was going to have to set the alarm clock for Nomination Tuesday in case of an Academy nod.
  Negative
This was going to be pure genre escapism, accompanied by a giant bucket of popcorn and a large helping of just-go-with-it.
  Positive
These days your faithful reviewer refers to such fare as a Generous Pour Movie.
  Negative
As in, get the -ounce Pinot Noir, settle in and have some mindless fun.
  Negative
If you don't drink, get that popcorn or those nachos and that generous pour of one of the , flavored drinks on tap.
  Negative
The blood-soaked potboiler First Kill is Generous Pour through and through, from Bruce Willis playing a cop for the umpteenth time in his career to the old switcheroo we can see coming a mile away to the pounding and overwrought score to some genuinely effective detours and subplots.
  Negative
Remember when Hayden Christensen was quite the big deal in the s, what with his fine work in films such as Life as a House and Shattered Glass, and his being cast as Anakin Skywalker?
  Neutral
Well, here he is playing Will, a successful Wall Street stockbroker with a macho streak who makes a spur-of-the-moment decision to take his wife Adele Magi Avila and their young son Danny Ty Ty Shelton on a vacation to the town where Will grew up.
  Negative
He hasnt been back in years and years.
  Negative
The main purpose of the getaway is for Will to take Danny on his first hunting trip.
  Positive
Time to kill!
  Neutral
We get the sense Will doesnt spend as much time with Danny as he should, and this is his way of reaching out to the boy, in the hopes theyll bond in the woods as Will teaches Danny how to use a rifle and zero in on the prey.
  Very negative
In a classic case of bad timing and the plot device that gives us a movie, Will and Danny happen upon a confrontation in the woods between two bank robbers.
  Negative
Once the bad guys spot Will and Danny  well, its not good.
  Negative
Gethin Anthony gives the films best performance as Levi, the bank robber who takes Danny hostage.
  Very positive
Once they arrive at Levis place, we learn a little bit about Levis life and his motivations for participating in the crime.
  Negative
He becomes an increasingly sympathetic albeit deeply flawed figure, even forging a father-son dynamic with Danny, who isnt shy about speaking his mind.
  Negative
Danny never forgets the guy hes talking to is, you know, a bank robber and a kidnapper, but he sees something redeemable about Levi.
  Neutral
Meanwhile, Will gets deeper and deeper in the muck as he tries to rescue Danny.
  Negative
Bruce Willis Howell is a veteran lawman with some long-ago and mysterious history with Wills parents.
  Positive
Howell teams up with Will to track down the stolen loot and find the bad guys and save Danny  but he begins to suspect Will isnt being completely honest with him.
  Negative
Then again, whats up with Howell?
  Neutral
What are the motivations behind that trademark Bruce Willis smirk and the tricky gleam in his eye?
  Neutral
And dang, thats some quasi-Tarantino exploding-head stuff right there!
  Negative
Generous.
  Neutral
Pour.
