supporters might find Desierto to be over the top and heavy-handed, what with a lone redneck literally gunning down Mexican migrants who have illegally crossed the border into the American Southwest.
  Negative
I mean, geez.
  Negative
Desierto isnt really much of a political commentary or social commentary as it is the umpteenth cinematic variation on The Most Dangerous Game and a number of other movies in which humans are hunted down like prey in the wild.
  Negative
Director and co-writer Jons Cuarn son of the director Alfonso Cuarn, with whom he shared writing credit on Gravity is a talented visual stylist, providing a steady diet of stunning long shots of the blistering hot, unforgiving flats of Mexico and the rocky terrain of the Southwest.

From the moment the first chilling shot crackles through the quiet morning, Desierto becomes nothing more than a well-filmed but sadistic thriller, with Sam picking off his victims, and Moises trying to stay one step ahead of him, keep Adela safe and find a way to turn the tables on Sam.
