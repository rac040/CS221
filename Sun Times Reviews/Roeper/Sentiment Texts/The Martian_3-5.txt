Finally!
  Neutral
A botanist superhero!
  Positive
What took you so long, Hollywood?
  Neutral
Ridley Scotts The Martian is arguably the warmest, cuddliest film ever made about the Red Planet, and thats all the more surprising given Scotts mastery of beautiful, haunting nearly cold-to-the-touch futuristic movies such as Blade Runner, Alien and Prometheus.
  Positive
We love those films, but they arent exactly warm and fuzzy.
  Positive
The Martian, on the other hand, is a hopeful love letter to science and math, American resolve, the power of friendship and the dream of a world in which nations set aside their differences to unite to bring one man home.
  Very positive
Its also a visual stunner, and it features one of our most likable and dependable actors giving a performance that ranks with anything hes ever done.
  Positive
The Martian is set in the near future, in a world where NASA apparently has kazillions of dollars, and the third manned and womaned mission to Mars has set up camp on the Red Planet and is going about its daily business of collecting samples, monitoring the atmosphere and doing other astronaut-type stuff.
  Negative
Matt Damon is Mark Watney, a brilliant botanist with a corny sense of humor, undying loyalty to the Cubbies, love of deep-dish pizza  and an explorers spirit, as evidenced by his joining the Ares  team on this mission.
  Positive
Jessica Chastain is the commander, Kate Mara is the computer expert, Michael Pena is the wisecracking, family man, comic relief astronaut.
  Positive
Theyre a neat team, and for the first few scenes, The Martian feels like its going to be a prototypical ensemble-cast space adventure.
  Positive
But then a massive dust storm hits harder and faster than anticipated, forcing the crew into emergency evacuation mode.
  Negative
Believing Mark has been killed by a flying piece of a communications tower, Cmdr. Lewis tearfully issues the order to take off.
  Negative
When Mark regains consciousness, he wakes up to a world of hurt he has a suffered a severe abdominal injury and the brutal truth of his circumstances: Hes injured, hes alone, he has no means of communication and a limited supply of food, and he is almost certainly going to die on Mars.
  Very negative
Not that Mark is the type to give up.
  Neutral
Im going to have to science the s' out of this, he says in his running video diary, and in one case he means that literally.
  Negative
Damon strikes just the right notes of comedy, nerdy tech talk, moments of despair and triumph.
  Positive
Mark cannot believe the music library of Cmdr.Lewis its heavy on cheesy s tunes, or the nerdy video games left behind.
  Negative
When he builds a greenhouse of sorts and successfully engineers actual plant growth, he hops around with glee, calls himself the first Martian and says, In your face, Neil Armstrong.
  Positive
And when he miraculously hears from his crew, hes overcome with emotion.
  Positive
The Martian is three movies in one:
 Cmdr. Lewis and crew on the ship, well on the way home, and the decision theyll have to make when they learn their friend is alive.
  Positive
A tense thriller of sorts back on Earth.
  Positive
Jeff Daniels is perfectly cast as the head of NASA, who wonders if its worth risking lives and spending untold millions to save one man.
  Positive
Chiwetel Ejiofor is the NASA scientist and Sean Bean is the home-base chief of the Ares  crew, and in their own ways, both answer yes.Welcome faces such as Kristen Wiig, Donald Glover, Benedict Wong and Mackenzie Davis have small but pivotal roles.
  Very negative
All three stories work, though we get a few too many scenes of the scientists on Earth saying they need six months to build this or that, only to be told it has to be done in two months, now get to work!
  Negative
Overall, though, even with a running time of  hours,  minutes, The Martian moves along at a steady clip.
  Neutral
Damon is terrific.
  Very positive
The movie lives and breathes on his performance, and he comes through in every scene.
  Positive
Chastain is her usual brilliant self in a smallish role, Ejiofor is the guy were rooting for to get it done on Earth, and Sean Bean brings that Ned StarkBoromir nobility to his performance.
  Negative
You look at the names in this cast and youd be correct in assuming this is going to be one helluva fun movie to watch.
  Positive
