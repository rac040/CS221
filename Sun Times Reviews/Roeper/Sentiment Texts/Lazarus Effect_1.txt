Clocking in at just  minutes, The Lazarus Effect has one of the shortest running times in recent years.
  Negative
And yet.
  Neutral
If only Olivia Wildes character in Lazarus had run into Scarlett Johanssons character in last years equally abysmal Lucy.
  Negative
At least then we would could have seen what would happen when a woman who has tapped into the brains full capacity, giving her amazing but dangerous superpowers, runs into ANOTHER woman who has tapped into the brains full capacity, giving HER amazing but dangerous superpowers.
  Negative
The Lazarus Effect is nothing but a cheap horror film cloaked in scientific mumbo-jumbo.
  Negative
The likable Mark Duplass is Frank, a brilliant, workaholic medical researcher leading a small team of scientists who have been working in a university laboratory for three years on a super-secret project to develop a serum that will enable doctors to resuscitate recently deceased patients long enough to find a cure or a spare heart or whatever it takes to give them the second chance everyone deserves, as Frank puts it.
  Positive
In other words, Frank isPLAYING GOD.
  Negative
Doesnt he know what happens to scientists in the movies who think they can play God?!?!
  Neutral
The team:
The plucky and sweet Zoe Olivia Wilde, Franks fiancee.
  Neutral
Niko Donald Glover, who apparently had a fling with Zoe when they were in college and is still in love with her.
  Neutral
Clay Evan Peters, the obligatory video game-loving, rules-breaking, potato-chip munching genius.
  Negative
Eva Sarah Bolger, a college student who has been assigned to video the experiments as the team gets closer to finding a serum that works.
  Negative
The big breakthrough comes when the team is able to resuscitate a long-dead dog named Rocky.
  Positive
From the get-go, its clear Rocky aint the pup he used to be' he has no appetite, and he wavers between listlessness and Cujo-esque aggressiveness.
  Negative
So what do Zoe and Frank do?
  Neutral
They take Rocky home to keep an eye on him!
  Positive
Thats because in movies such as this, exceedingly intelligent scientists have to display all the intelligence and logic of a bikini-clad bimbo in a s splatter film who hears a suspicious noise in the basement after the power goes out and goes downstairs, saying, Whos there?
  Negative
Come on, this isnt funny any more!'
  Positive
for those of you who have seen, like, four scary movies in your whole life.
  Positive
You know when someone looks under the bed and nothing is there, when he turns around, BOOM!
  Negative
Gotcha!
  Neutral
You know a dream sequence is likely to involve a silent little girl standing at the end of a long corridor.
  Negative
You know lights will go out and elevators wont work, and no matter how much noise and madness occurs in an enclosed area in the dead of night, nobody will ever hear anything and call the cops.
  Negative
The poster and the advertising for The Lazarus Effect give the following away, so here goes.
  Neutral
When Zoe is electrocuted and conventional methods to revive her fail, Frank reaches for the magic serum, even though theyve all seen what it did to poor Rocky the dog.
  Negative
Suffice to say when Zoe is brought back to life, it takes about five minutes for everyone to realize their mistake.
  Negative
And then they go back to doing stupid things and isolating themselves so theyre vulnerable.
  Negative
From that point forward, The Lazarus Effect plays like a throwaway horror flick.
  Negative
The talented cast does what they can with the underdeveloped characters theyve been handed, and theres some decent cinematography and a few nifty special effects.
  Positive
We end on a note leaving things open for a sequel, and thats some mighty optimistic thinking on the part of the filmmakers.
  Negative
