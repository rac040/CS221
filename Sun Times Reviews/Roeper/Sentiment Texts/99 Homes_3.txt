For the first hour-plus of  Homes, I felt I was watching a legit Best Picture contender  which made it all the more disappointing when the last act turned into overwrought, coincidence-dependent and semi-plausible melodrama.
  Negative
The wheels dont come off altogether, but the plot swerved after hitting some serious potholes.
  Negative
Its still an easy recommendation, with director and co-writer Ramin Bahrani delivering a provocative, visceral, sometimes heartbreakingly relevant dramathriller centered on the financial crisis of the late s and the subsequent housing collapse, which resulted in thousands upon thousands of American families forcibly evicted from their homes because they could no longer keep up with mortgage payments.
  Positive
Andrew Garfield a talented actor who was too old to play the teenager Peter ParkerSpider-Man in the latest reboot does fine work as Dennis, a likable, earnest and hard-working construction jack-of-all trades who lives with his mother Laura Dern and his young son Connor Noah Lomax in the suburban Orlando house where Dennis grew up.
  Positive
Dennis is hard at work on a new-home construction site when the foreman tells everyone to stop working immediately.
  Negative
The developer has pulled the plug on the project for lack of funds.
  Negative
In fact, theyve all been working for free for the last couple of weeks.
  Negative
Nobodys getting paid.
  Neutral
This is but the latest financial setback for Dennis, who has fallen months behind on the house payments its a little surprising he has to make payments on the ranch house he grew up in, but there you have it and wins no sympathy from a judge who rips through eviction hearings as if hes rubber-stamping parking tickets.
  Negative
Dennis is desperately looking for work and trying to buy some time when two cops and a real estate broker named Rick Carver Michael Shannon pound on the door, informing Dennis he no longer owns the home.
  Negative
In fact hes now actually trespassing on property owned by Carver, and the family has a few minutes to gather what possessions they can and evacuate the premises.
  Negative
This is the first of many eviction scenes, each one more devastating and difficult to sit through than the next.
  Negative
In one instance, an elderly man without full control of his mental faculties sits on his front stoop, mumbling with almost childlike confusion about his plight.
  Negative
He literally has nowhere to go.
  Negative
Dennis, his mother and his son move into a cheap, rundown motel overflowing with other evicteds.
  Negative
When Dennis tells a neighbor this is just a short-term thing, she says, Yeah, thats what I said two years ago.
  Negative
Through a plot contrivance requiring a leap of faith, the desperate Dennis actually goes to work for Carver, who takes an immediate shine to Dennis and starts grooming him.
  Negative
It feels as if were watching Wall Street, but instead of high finance, its all about the ways legal and otherwise in which real estate agents and investors seize on others misfortunes to swoop in, offer a small bundle of cash for a foreclosed home, fix it up and flip it.
  Negative
At first Dennis is just doing home repairs and coming along for the ride, but its not long before HES the one showing up with the cops to kick families out of their homes.
  Negative
Homes is a morality play, and the slick, opportunistic, intimidating and corrupt Carver is clearly deeply entrenched on the dark side  though he does make some legitimate points about how the government and the banks encouraged and fostered financially reckless behavior, and how many a homeowner eagerly seized the chance to buy big or to add unnecessary luxury additions to ahome without a second thought as to the long-term consequences.
  Negative
Still, at times it feels as if Carver is the devil himself, feeding on human misery.
  Negative
Shannon is a powerful force as an actor, but hes such a menacing figure its a bit difficult to buy him in the scenes when hes supposed to be seducing Dennis with his get-rich-quick patter, or throwing lavish, hedonistic parties.
  Negative
Dennis is such a good guy, so loyal to family and friends, we stay with him and root for him even as his moral compass gets shakier and shakier, and his rationalizations become weaker and weaker.
  Positive
Garfield is at his best when Dennis regurgitates Carvers line of B.S. with great passion but not necessarily full conviction.
  Positive
At times Carver sounds like Donald Trump, e.g., American doesnt bail out the losers, it bails out the winners.
  Very negative
That hes speaking the truth makes his words all the more chilling.
  Positive
By the time Dennis is no longer blinded by the green skies ahead, as Carver puts it, he might be past the point of redemption.
  Negative
Now a return to the disappointing news.
  Negative
In the last several scenes,  Homes changes tones, unconvincingly.
  Negative
Its almost as if were watching a different movie  one not nearly as sharp and original.
  Negative
That disappointment noted, some of the early scenes are striking and unforgettable.
  Very positive
Don't get emotional about real estate, says Rick Carver.
  Negative
But who doesnt?
  Neutral
