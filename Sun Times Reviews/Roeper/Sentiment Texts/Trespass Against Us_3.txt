Well it just so happens the character played by Fassbender in Trespass Against Us really does have a puppy-in-a-tree scene, but Im not going to tell you when and where and why it happens, because its worth the journey for you to get there on your own.

This is a strange, rambling, ambitious little hybrid of a movie  equal parts film-festival-friendly dysfunctional family comedydrama and offbeat crime thriller.
