We veer close to the edge of Precious, Indie-Hipster Cliche so often in Infinitely Polar Bear, but thanks to a gifted filmmaker and two brilliant lead performances, the voice-over narration and the home-movie footage and the flights of fancy arent as off-putting as they might have been in lesser hands.
  Negative
Infinitely Polar Bear is told mostly from the point of view of Amelia Imogene Wolodarsky, the oldest daughter of Maggie Zoe Saldana and Cam Mark Ruffalo.
  Negative
Amelia tells us her father was diagnosed as manic-depressive in , when he was found wandering Cambridge wearing a fake beard and saying his name was Jesus John Harvard.
  Negative
We pick up the story in , on a bright and lovely morning when Cam tells Amelia and her younger sister Faith Ashley Aufderheide they dont have to go to school because Daddy just got fired again, and isnt that wonderful, and theyre going to go mushroom-picking and make an omelet for Mommy.
  Positive
Uh-oh.
  Neutral
Cam veers from those moments of frantic, frighteningly upbeat, whirling-dervish activities to alarm-bell-ringing bursts of temper, as when he rips out pieces of the engine on the familys old beater of a car so Maggie wont be able to leave with the kids.
  Negative
Ruffalo does a magnificent job of conveying Cams charm and undeniable love for his wife and children  as well as the devastating effects of serious, incurable mental illness.
  Positive
His mood swings can be tempered with treatment and medication, but Cam is never going to be anything less than unpredictable, even on his best days.
  Negative
Cam comes from an old-money Boston family, but his grandmother keeps a tight grip on the purse strings.
  Positive
When he visits her and asks for money to send the girls to private school, she says that would send the wrong message to the children.
  Negative
Hes unable to hold down a job, so its Maggie who takes any work she can find, and Maggie who applies for and gets a scholarship to pursue an MBA in New York City.
  Negative
This leaves Cam in charge of the children, who adore their father but are often horrified by his embarrassing behavior.
  Negative
Often their roles are reversed, with Amelia and Faith telling Cam to clean up his act and to stop acting so weird with the neighbors and to let them have their own friends and their own lives.
  Negative
Even though Infinitely Polar Bear is set mostly in the Boston of the late s and Cam and Maggie are a biracial couple, theres very little mention of race, save for a moment where Maggie lays out the difference between white people being poor and black people being poor  and a scene in which Amelia tells her father she doesnt look black at all, and Cam says her mother is black so of course shes black, and Amelia says fine, shell keep telling people shes black even though they look at her like shes delusional.
  Negative
Given the Rachel Dolezal story, that scene got a huge laugh at the preview screening.
  Positive
Writerdirector Maya Forbes based Infinitely Polar Bear partly on her childhood as the daughter of a white, Boston Brahmin, bipolar father and an African-American mother who put herself through business school and was the family breadwinner at a time when that was highly unusual.
  Negative
Saldana gives one of her best performances as Maggie, who is torn apart by the prospect of leaving her children largely in the care of Cam for  months because she sees no other way.
  Positive
Ruffalo throws himself into the role of Cam, chain-smoking, wearing ridiculous outfits, exploding in fits of rage and yet filled with tender love for his two girls.
  Positive
A simple scene in which Cam wants to take the girls on the lake after school but theyd rather spend time with their friends is perfect and heartbreaking in the way it plays out.
  Very positive
