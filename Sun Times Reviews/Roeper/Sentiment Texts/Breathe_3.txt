We know Andrew Garfields Robin Cavendish is going to be paralyzed from the neck down for the bulk of this story, because this movie is called Breathe and it is based on the life and times of a man who is basically handed a death sentence in his s  but refuses to accept it, and in the process helps change the world.
  Negative
The way young Robin hurtles through life, bashing away at a spirited game of cricket, driving recklessly through the English countryside, bounding about the rugged topography of Nairobi, one fully expects hell be grievously injured in a freak accident or a car wreck or a terrible fall.
  Negative
But this being the late s, its polio that strikes Robin.
  Negative
One moment hes a charming, handsome, athletic, perpetually upbeat chap, on top of the world.
  Positive
Hes over the moon in love with his wife, the kind and lovely socialite Diana Claire Foy, who has just announced shes pregnant' hes surrounded by his legions of hail-fellow-well-met friends, and hes rapidly growing his business as a tea broker.
  Negative
Then one day Robin loses a tennis match to a lifelong friend who has never beat him.
  Neutral
He feels dizzy and a little weak  but shrugs it off to the Kenyan heat and exhaustion from working so hard.
  Negative
Later that night hes drenched in sweat and finding it difficult to breathe, and he collapses in a heap and is rushed to the hospital.
  Very negative
And within a couple of days, doctors are telling Diana that Robin will never be able to move from the neck down, he cannot breathe without the aid of a machine, and in all likelihood hell be gone within months.
  Negative
Breathe is the directorial debut of the most accomplished motion-capture actor in the world: Andy Serkis, celebrated for his award-worthy work as Gollum in the 'Lord of the Rings movies and Caesar in the most recent Planet of the Apes series.
  Positive
It is no small irony an artist of such beautiful physicality and facial animation would choose to make a film about a man who is nearly frozen and has to strain mightily to find the strength to move his head enough to ring a bell dangling just an inch from his temples.
  Negative
Breathe is an inspirational story well told, but its essentially a paint-by-numbers biopic of a very deserving subject, with only a few bursts of stylistic flair and a couple of minor surprises at best.
  Positive
When Robin learns his fate, he falls into a deep depression, refuses to see his child, tries to send his wife away.
  Negative
Diana, of course, will have nothing of the sort.
  Negative
She refuses to stop loving Robin.
  Negative
century, virtually all quadriplegics in the world spent their lives in hospital, rarely if ever seeing the light of day, hooked up to enormous and noisy breathing machines that looked and sounded like instruments of torture.
  Negative
Diana wont have that.
  Neutral
Robin begins to find a renewed interest in life when he and Diana hatch a plan for Robin to return home because, after all, you just plug in the breathing machine, and they have outlets in houses as well as in hospitals, right?
  Negative
Why yes, of course.
  Neutral
Problem is, if the plug is dislodged from its socket or the power goes out at home as opposed to a hospital with -hour care, one will most likely die, and quite quickly.
  Negative
As fortune would have it, Robin is dear friends with an Oxford professor who loves to tinker with all things mechanical and electrical, and the professor devises a crude but ingenious customized wheelchair with a portable respirator.
  Negative
Hugh Bonneville, the patriarch in Downton Abbey, plays the mechanic-prof.
  Negative
Its kind of fun to see the Earl of Grantham smeared with grease and banging away with wrenches and electrical sockets.
  Positive
Robin goes from nearly suicidal to perennially positive, enjoying the shocked looks he gets when hes out and about in his motorized wheelchair.
  Negative
Most of his friends and their spouses seem to exist solely to gather 'round him at parties and to offer toasts in his honor and to accompany him on his travels on behalf of the disabled.
  Negative
Its all very uplifting, especially when Robin succeeds in shocking the worldwide medical community into rethinking how they treat quadriplegics, but something tells me it cant have been quite so much fun for so many years.
  Very positive
As if reminding himself of that, director Serkis suddenly switches gears in the late going, giving us repeated scenes in which Robin has trouble breathing, and his lungs fill with blood, and he nearly dies.
  Negative
Andrew Garfield is often cast as a man in action and in severe peril, from his turn in a couple of Spidey adventures to films such as Silence and Hacksaw Ridge.
  Negative
Hes just as effective here, even though the great bulk of his scenes have him bedridden or strapped into a bulky wheelchair.
  Negative
Thirty minutes in, were pretty sure we know how the movie is going to turn out  even if were unfamiliar with Robins remarkable journey and his lasting impact.
  Negative
That doesnt mean Breathe isnt worth seeing' it just means that even though were watching Robin go through almost unbearably painful physical and emotional pain, its a pretty comfortable trip for the viewer.
  Negative
