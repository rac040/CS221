For all its irreverence and blasphemy, the religious satire The Little Hours has something of a nostalgic vibe.
  Positive
It has the same brazen and utterly sacrilegious tone of Monty Python and the Holy Grail and Monty Pythons Life of Brian.
  Negative
Though its not in the same league.
  Neutral
Then again, very few comedies of ANY kind are in that league.
  Neutral
Writer-director Jeff Baena clearly couldnt give a hoot whether his ribald tale of Nuns Gone Wild will offend  and thats a relatively rare thing in these sensitive and oh so politically correct times.
  Positive
century Italy, The Little Hours has some wonderfully anachronistic and tart dialogue' bold and sharp and very funny work from an outstanding ensemble cast including alums from Parks and Recreation, Saturday Night Live and Community,' and yes, a few salient albeit obvious points about sanctimony and hypocrisy cloaked in the vestments of organized religion.
  Positive
The wonderful deadpan sharpshooter Aubrey Plaza is in her comfort zone and knocks it out of the park as Sister Fernanda, the Alpha Nun of a trio that includes the sweet and starry-eyed Sister Alessandra Alison Brie and the snarky and snitch-y Sister Ginevra Kate Micucci.
  Negative
In an opening moment setting the tone for the entirety of the story, a kindly groundskeeper pauses from his chores to innocently say to the nuns, Its a beautiful morning, sisters.
  Negative
This sends Sister Fernanda into a foul-mouthed rage thats ridiculous and unwarranted and brutal and flat-out funny: Hey, dont f'ing talk to us, f'ing creep!
  Very negative
Now get the f' out of here!
  Negative
Off scurries the groundskeeper, while the nuns return to doing the work of the Lord.
  Negative
Plazas Parks and Rec pal Nick Offerman plays the ruthless and quite twisted Lord Bruno, who is out to kill the workman Massetto Dave Franco after Brunos wife Francesca Lauren Weedman seduces Massetto.
  Negative
On the run, Massetto encounters Father Tommasso John C. Reilly, who offers Massetto refuge as a hired hand at the convent  but says Massetto must pretend to be deaf and mute in order to minimize communication and reduce temptation with the nuns.
  Negative
Not the greatest plan ever hatched.
  Negative
From the moment Massetto arrives on the scene, plunked into the middle of a remote setting where a number of sexually repressed women regard him as the meal theyve been waiting for, The Little Hours is not unlike The Beguiled played for laughs.
  Negative
Even with generous helpings of nudity and profanity, the sex scenes are played for laughs, sometimes to great effect, as when Sister Ginevra is driven nearly insane once her inner lust is unleashed.
  Negative
The reliable Molly Shannon is terrific as Sister Marea, the hopelessly outmatched mentor to the young nuns.
  Positive
The sly and likable Fred Armisen shows up as a bishop who is horrified by the goings-on at the convent.
  Positive
This is the longest list of sins Ive ever had.
  Negative
Eating blood?
  Neutral
Do you think Ive ever written down eating blood before?
  Neutral
Jemima Kirke from Girls oversees a pagan ritual in the woods, because movies such as this should definitely have a pagan ritual in the woods.
  Negative
True, The Little Hours is essentially a one-joke comedy  but most of the jokes under the umbrellas of that one joke are pretty damn, I mean darn, funny.
  Neutral
