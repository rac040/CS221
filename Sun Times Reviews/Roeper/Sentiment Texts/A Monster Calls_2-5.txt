Even with all the special effects and practical effects wizardry available to the movie world, sometimes you see a fable brought to live action on the big screen and you think:
Hmmmm.
  Positive
Maybe it would have worked better as a pure animated film.
  Neutral
Such is the case with A Monster Calls, a mostly well-filmed and well-intentioned but only occasionally involving adaptation of the childrens book about a lonely boy with a dying mother who is visited in the dead of night by the forbidding tree outside his bedroom window.
  Negative
Yes, a tree.
  Positive
A giant, sprawling tree with enormous, intertwining branches that morph into arms and legs and a human-like face' fire brimming in his eyes and his mouth, and a booming voice that sounds very much like Liam Neeson.
  Negative
You might find this monster-tree to be a wondrous, magical onscreen creation.
  Negative
His its?
  Neutral
spell was lost on me  in part because the great Liam Neesons theatrical line readings kept taking me out of the story and reminding me it was Liam Neeson voicing that tree.
  Negative
He sounds like Aslan from The Chronicles of Narnia, only much angrier.
  Negative
Lewis MacDougall plays Conor OMalley, an English schoolboy of about .
  Negative
Hes a quiet, thoughtful, sweet, quirky kid who is troubled by disturbing nightmares of his mother falling into the abyss in a church graveyard  only to wake up to a life even more terrifying than his dreams.
  Negative
Conors mom Felicity Jones, the heroine in Rogue One is dying of cancer.
  Negative
His father Toby Kebbell is long gone, living in California with his new family.
  Negative
His grandmother Sigourney Weaver is a cold, harsh woman who seems more attached to the fine objects in her house than to her grandson.
  Negative
Oh, and just about every day when Conor goes to school, he is taunted and teased  and beaten up  by a pack of bullies.
  Negative
This makes for one overcrowded assemblage of issues.
  Neutral
Somewhere from within Conors subconscious, a monster calls in the form of that hulking, earth-rattling, disturbing tree, who visits Conor in Conors darkest moments  not to terrorize the boy, but to teach him life lessons and help him get to the truth behind those nightmares about his mother.
  Negative
The monster tells Conor three stories on three consecutive nights, and tells Conor the fourth story will come from Conor and will be Conors and it will be the truth  your truth.
  Positive
Each story contains a lesson, but the lesson is not easily uncovered.
  Negative
Director J.A. Bayona The Orphanage is a gifted stylist, and he infuses the animated parables with arresting visuals created by the Spanish animation team known as Headless Productions.
  Very positive
The set designs and the attention to detail regarding Conors illustrations  equally impressive.
  Positive
Conor summons the monster to help him fight back against the bullies, act out against his grandmother and voice his rage at the fate of his mother.
  Negative
Only he can see the monster, of course, because the monster lives only in his imagination.
  Negative
Often, though, these moments of clarity and triumph are more disturbing that uplifting.
  Positive
Were rooting for Conor, but some of his actions are indicative of someone in need of serious and immediate care.
  Negative
Sigourney Weavers icy grandmother character is another drawback.
  Negative
She clearly loves her daughter although shes awfully pushy with the poor girl, but theres no rhyme nor reason for her almost cruel indifference to Conor.
  Negative
A Monster Calls is based on the internationally best-selling, critically acclaimed novel written by Patrick Ness, who was inspired by an idea that came to the writer Siobhan Dowd when she was dying of cancer.
  Negative
It aims straight for our hearts, sometimes hitting the target, especially in some of the quieter scenes with Conor and his mother.
  Negative
But then the preachy tree rears its thorny head, and it keeps on talking and explaining, long after we get it, we get it, we get it.
  Negative
