The thing about scaling a mountain is even if you reach the peak, you have to go back down  and by that point youre exhausted, disoriented, struggling for breath and in many cases fending off snow blindness and frostbite and swelling of the brain, among other lovely side effects.
  Very negative
Based on true events, filled with stunning visuals and featuring more than a half-dozen of our best actors delivering solid performances, Baltasar Kormakurs Everest is a high-altitude roller coaster ride that will leave you drained  even though at times its difficult to distinguish one climber from the next in the swirl of the storm, and character development takes a back seat to the harrowing action.
  Positive
Inspired by the true events of  that led to Jon Krakauers best-selling non-fiction thriller 'Into Thin Air,' Everest is a dramatization of events.
  Negative
We get a handful of heroes and no true villains, though some climbers come off as more noble and selfless than others.
  Negative
One could understand how some of the families of the men whodidnt make it might not be thrilled with a few speculative scenes.
  Negative
Jason Clarke, one of those actors whose face youll recognize from roles in such films as Zero Dark Thirty and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and Terminator Genisys even though hes yet to become a household name, plays Rob Hall, a New Zealand mountaineer who helped pioneer the concept of turning Mount Everest into the ultimate adult fantasy camp.
  Negative
For a considerable fee, Halls Adventure Consultants and other firms that quickly followed would lead amateur albeit seasoned climbers up the worlds tallest, most dangerous and most famous peak.
  Negative
Robs a solid guy with a pregnant wife Keira Knightley, the unwavering loyalty of his team  and a tendency to be almost too sympathetic to the dreams of his clients.
  Negative
Jake Gyllenhaals Scott Fischer, on the other hand, is a free-spirited American guide who believes if you cant make it up the mountain with minimal help, you shouldnt be on the mountain in the first place.
  Negative
We know Scotts a rebel because when we first see him at base camp, hes shirtless, hes got a badass ponytail and cool sunglasses, hes catching some rays and drinking booze, and he smirks a lot.
  Negative
Other featured players get similarly basic back stories, told in quick and straightforward fashion.
  Negative
Krakauer Michael Kelly from House of Cards is a famous journalist writing about the climb  but hes determined to make it all the way to the top as well.
  Positive
Josh Brolins Beck is a  percent Texan, as he puts it, who talks a macho game but has a secret about why hes really out there.
  Positive
John Hawkes Doug is a mailman whose explanation for why hes on this climb is the only moment when we get anything beyond, Because its there.
  Negative
Theyre explorers.
  Neutral
Thrill-seekers.
  Neutral
And in the cases of the main characters, theyre doing this for a living.
  Negative
In movies such as Everest and Into the Wild and  Hours, I sometimes find it just a little more difficult to become emotionally invested in the characters, only because one cant forget they chose to put themselves in these situations.
  Negative
Its not the same as when a character has survived a plane crash, or is fighting a war, or is trying to rescue someone else.
  Negative
This is not to say I didnt care about Rob or Doug or any of the other characters in Everest.
  Negative
As portrayed by these fine actors, these are good people, in many cases good people with spouses and children waiting at home for them, and theres no denying the powerful tug of a couple of scenes involving wives played by Robin Wright and Keira Knightley, who are tethered to the telephone and feeling helpless as they hear increasingly dire reports about their husbands.
  Positive
By , the business of climbing Mount Everest was booming  to the point where there were actual human traffic jams of various teams jockeying for position to reach the peak during a two-week window in May when conditions werent quite as brutal as normal.
  Negative
Its still more like trying to survive on another planet than an inhabitable section of Earth.
  Neutral
Everest does a fine job of laying out that situation  and then the climb begins, and storms hit, and its all about the special effects and the practical stunts, and following along with various climbers who stop short and turn back, reach the summit victoriously andor draw their final breaths on Everest, like so many before them.
