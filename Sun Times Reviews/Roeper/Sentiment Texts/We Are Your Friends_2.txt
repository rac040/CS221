  Negative
All you need is a laptop, some talent and one track, says Cole  an assessment Im guessing wouldnt sit well with the likes of Skrillex and other superstar DJs who can fill arenas around the globe with their talent for mixing music magic.
  Positive
Director and co-writer Max Joseph brings a kind of DJ sensibility to his approach, having fun with the material and injecting animation and graphics and other zippy touches into certain scenes, i.e., when Cole explains how his goal as a DJ is to get your heart racing at  BPM Beats Per Minute, at which point youll be under his spell and youll dance until you pass out or some such thing.
  Positive
On the heels of the exhilarating creative passages in the Brian Wilson film Love amp' Mercy and the N.W.A. movie Straight Outta Compton, this is pretty silly and superficial stuff.
  Negative
Just as John Travoltas Tony Manero in Fever hung around with a scrappy, ragtag bunch of childhood friends, Cole is tight with his crew of scrappy, ragtag childhood friends.
  Negative
Tonys group included the diminutive and troubled Bobby C. Coles group includes the diminutive and troubled Squirrel.

  Negative
James beautiful girlfriend Emily Ratajkowski eventually has a thing for Cole.
  Positive
We Are Your Friends earns its R rating for generous heapings of casual drug use, female nudity, language and sex  but it still feels like a lightweight take on the EDM culture.
  Negative
Nearly all of the successful andor ambitious people in this movie are good-looking white men, while the women are dancers and party girls and personal assistants and sexual predators.
  Positive
The most substantial female role goes to Emily Ratajkowski, who sprang to fame based on that Blurred Lines video.

  Negative
Jon Bernthal Fury, The Walking Dead livens things up as a barracuda who hires the boys to cold-call homeowners who are underwater with their mortgages and take advantage of their plight.

  Positive
Night Fever and those iconic cuts from the Bee Gees.
  Neutral
The buildup to Coles One Big Shot at Stardom is simplistic and kinda goofy.
