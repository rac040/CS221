The tank with the word FURY painted on the turret is almost a character unto itself in the movie of the same name.
  Negative
With Brad Pitt at the helm and a ragtag, fiercely loyal crew burrowed inside, this tank just keeps on going and going and going  and even when she breaks down, shes got plenty of fight left in her.
  Negative
With strong echoes of Saving Private Ryan and a few stock characters out of dozens of other war movies, Fury also has an almost Rocky-like arc, with the stakes infinitely higher, of course.
  Positive
We get round after round of horrific, bloody battles, interspersed with brief scenes of macho dialogue and no small measure of Scripture-quoting.
  Negative
David Ayer, author of Training Day and writer-director of End of Watch, two of the most violent movies about Los Angeles cops of the last decade-plus, is the writer and director of Fury, and he really, REALLY knows how to blow things up, whether its buildings or tanks or soldiers.
  Very negative
Brad Pitt, sporting a haircut Im not sure was popular in , trim and fit at  but looking suitably grizzled and hard-bitten, is Sgt. Don Wardaddy Collier, and that nickname tells you where his head is.
  Negative
Don has killed Germans in Africa and in France and in Belgium, and now Im killing Germans in Germany, he says matter-of-factly.
  Negative
Its April  and Don is commanding a Sherman tank with a small crew on a near-suicide mission that will take them deep behind enemy lines.
  Negative
Dons crew includes the hard-drinking, trash-talking Trini Gordo Garcia Michael Pena' Boyd Bible Swan Shia LaBeouf, who quotes the Bible and says grace before meals, but doesnt exactly comport himself like a churchgoing man.
  Negative
and Grady Coon-Ass Travis Jon Bernthal, a savage Southerner whos well on his way to becoming a certified sociopath.
  Negative
Theyve exacted so much carnage and theyve seen so many comrades die, their eyes are glazed and they all seem on the edge of a nervous breakdown.
  Negative
Even their steely-eyed commander, who barks orders and always seems to be in charge, has to slip away from time to time to fall to his knees and succumb to the horror of it all.
  Negative
These men arent suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.
  Negative
Theyre dealing with that syndrome while still immersed in what Hitler called a total war, in which he enlisted every last man, woman and a child to make one last desperate stand in their homeland.
  Negative
The newest crew member on the Fury is Logan Lermans Norman Ellison, the prototypical clerktypist whos been in the Army all of eight weeks, has zero battle experience and is crying, vomiting and saying he wants to go home about three hours after joining the squad.
  Very negative
Lerman is terrific in a clichd role, and LeBeouf and Pena turn in strong performances as well.
  Positive
Bernthals character is another matter.
  Neutral
Coon-Ass Travis is such an over-the-top brute, such a wild-eyed maniac, that you wonder why Don hasnt had the guy declared a Section  and sent him home.
  Negative
Pitt is at the top of his game, playing a man who has forgotten whatever he used to be and has wholly embraced his role in this war.
  Neutral
Best job I ever had, is the mantra for Don and his crew.
  Positive
He becomes a father figure to Norman, but its as much for his own preservation as it is to get Norman up to speed as quickly as possible.
  Negative
In between all of Ayers well-choreographed, fog-of-war battle sequences which feature some of the more shocking kills in recent memory, theres an extended set piece where Don and Norman discover a German woman and her young cousin hiding in an apartment.
  Negative
The women are sure theyre going to be assaulted, perhaps even killed.
  Negative
Instead, we get a surprisingly delicate dance in which Norman attempts to restore some semblance of civility in midst of all the scattered corpses and burning buildings.
  Neutral
Its the one scene where Fury rises above its solid but standard war movie status and approaches something really special.
  Positive
Even as Don and his crew are cursing out the Nazis and screaming for them to die as they mow them down, Ayers doesnt turn the opposition into monsters.
  Negative
Theres even a key moment when a German soldier, given the chance to perform an act of grace, does just that.
  Positive
The tragedy of the carnage we see in Fury is that by April , both sides knew who was going to win, but as Don puts it, a whole lot of people are going to have to die before the war would finally end.
  Negative
Why wont the Germans just quit?
  Negative
asks one of Dons fellow tank commanders.
  Neutral
Would you?
  Neutral
says Don.
  Neutral
Thats one of the many hells of war.
  Neutral
You often have to keep on fighting even when the battle has been won.
  Neutral
