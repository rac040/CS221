I know.
  Neutral
But its true!
  Positive
With the stylish and darkly funny and bloodygorgeous pulp thriller John Wick in , and this equally entertaining and even more action-jammed thriller, the underworld legend known by colleagues as the man even the Boogeyman fears runs rings around the likes of those Fast and Furious gearheads, or Liam Neeson whenever someone is Taken from him, or little Jack Reacher.

If you havent seen the first John Wick, you should check it out, but in the meantime, a little background.
  Negative
Once the baddest of the bad, John Wick had settled into an idyllic retirement with his beatific wife Bridget Moynihan  until the wife died of Movie Plot Disease, and some horrible, mean, jerky Russian guys broke into Johns house, stole his beloved car and killed his beloved puppy what!
  Very negative
, and just like that, JOHN WICK WAS BACK, BABY, AND THERE WAS HELL TO PAY.

The sequel picks up almost immediately after the events of the original.
  Negative
John retrieves his car in a spectacularly ridiculous sequence in which the first dozen or so of at least  bodies pile up.
  Negative
John sustains many a wound to the midsection, but thanks to body armor and the incredibly bad aim of the generic henchmen and henchwomen  trying to take him down, his handsome face remains intact save for a few artfully placed bruises and scratches.
  Negative
Just when John thinks hes out  well, you know the rest.
  Neutral
The slimy Camorra gangster Santino DAntonio Riccardo Scamarcio calls in a marker, and John has no choice but to journey to Rome to carry out a hit on Santinos sister Gianna Claudia Gerini so Santino can take Giannas place on the secret, international council of crime bosses that pretty much controls the world.
  Negative
Thats one of the great things about the John Wick universe: Its a twisted fairy tale in which it seems as if about  percent of the people on the streets are assassins' criminals can take refuge in upscale hotels known as The Continental, where no violence is allowed' and nobody in the real world seems to be all that shaken when John and his adversaries shoot it out in public, leaving bodies on the street and broken glass everywhere.
  Neutral
This movie might set the record for most shattered glass.
  Neutral

Their tumble-down-the-stairs confrontation is one of the great fight scenes of the decade.

Magnificent supporting turns abound in John Wick .
  Neutral
Ian McShane returns as Winston, the civilized, rules must apply proprietor of the Continental.

Lance Reddick is back as Charon, the do-it-all concierge at the hotel.
  Negative
Ruby Rose is a kick as a killer who looks like a runway model, speaks in sign language and has J-U-S-T tattooed across her knuckles.
  Negative
And then theres Laurence Fishburne  thats right, Morpheus himself  as a New York crime lord who uses carrier pigeons to deliver  oh, I don't know  important information, employs hundreds of lookouts and informants disguised as the homeless, and laughs as if hes seen every movie in which bad guys guffaw with a gusto never heard in the actual human experience.
  Negative
If you think director Chad Stahelski and screenwriter Derek Kolstad pass up the opportunity for some crowd-pleasing Matrix references, come on!
  Negative
This is John Wicks world, and enjoy the ride.
  Very positive

  Neutral
Dan Laustsens cinematography is lush and stunning.
  Very positive
The set designs are fantastically, richly detailed, with many a nod to action-movie tropes such Hundreds of Candles Artfully Flickering for No Reason, and Sophisticated Bad Guy Lairs With Dark Wood Furniture and Interesting Art.
  Positive
Just when we thought Keanu Reeves was destined for a career of mostly forgettable films piling up in our straight-to-video cues, the guy is headlining a bona fide, first-class action franchise.
  Negative
Whoa.
