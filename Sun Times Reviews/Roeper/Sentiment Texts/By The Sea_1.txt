Writer-director-star Angelina Jolie Pitts By the Sea is awfully pretty and mostly dreadful.
  Negative
Its pretty dreadful.
  Negative
The first mistake Jolie Pitt the director made was to move forward with her own screenplay, which features two dull leading characters sleepwalking through an extended vacation thats all about him getting drunk, her self-medicating with pills  and the two of them spewing frustration, distaste and sometimes outright loathing for one another.
  Very negative
We HAVE to stop being such a''-, Pitts Roland says to his wife during a rare semi-tender moment.
  Negative
She laughs.
  Positive
We merely shake our heads and say, Too late, kids.
  Negative
By the Sea is set in the s, and Jolie Pitt wildly overdoes it with the oversized glasses and the oversized hat and the period-piece fashion  and the cover-of-Vogue makeup and hair she sports even when shes in a near-catatonic state in bed, or lolling in the bathtub or on the balcony of their hotel suite, staring off into the abyss.
  Negative
Roland is a writer who most have had some early success, judging by the cut of his jib and the Euro-cool rental car and the gorgeous, spacious hotel suite, which opens onto the sea and provides a breathtaking view.
  Very positive
Once Roland and Vanessa arrive on the scene, they silently move the furniture about to their liking, and unpack their bags, which include some trinkets from their home in New York City.
  Negative
Clearly theyre going to be here for a long while.
  Negative
Roland sets up his typewriter at a desk overlooking the sea  but every morning, he tucks his notebook into the back of his pants and trundles down to the bar, where he quaffs multiple gins and ignores his writing, choosing instead to commiserate with the kindly old barkeep Niels Arestrup who is still in mourning over his wife.
  Negative
Both Pitts speak impressive French in the film.
  Very positive
Brad in particular seems to be enjoying his casual Francais conversations with the local townsfolk.
  Positive
Vanessa, we learn, was once quite the star of the stage.
  Negative
Now she spends her days popping pills, speaking in robotic monotones and waiting for Roland to return to the room so they can bicker.
  Negative
When a honeymooning couple Melanie Laurent and Melvil Poupaud arrive on the scene with in such unsubtle fashion they might as well be holding up a sign proclaiming PLOT DEVICE and they take the room next door, Vanessa discovers a peephole with a convenient view of the bed.
  Negative
NOW Vanessas got a hobby.
  Neutral
Roland and Vanessa have been married for  years.
  Neutral
Theyre miserable.
  Negative
For nearly two hours, By the Sea hints at something dark and tragic in their past, all the while giving us the wise and ancient heartbroken widower as a symbol of Rolands possible future, and the cooing, sexually carnivorous young couple as reminders of how things once were between Roland and Vanessa.
  Negative
Jolie Pitt the director confines a great deal of the action to the hotel suite, but when the characters venture out, the scenery is gorgeous and bright and beautiful and of a paradise  and a striking contrast to the darkness that envelopes Roland and Vanessa.
  Positive
The score and some of the cinematography are vaguely reminiscent of late-period Hitchcock, but what this film could use is a good old-fashioned murder or two, or at least a double-cross or twisted mystery.
  Negative
As for the performances: Jolie Pitt delivers some of the more uninspired work of her career, veering from making kitten-like whimpers when shes sad to turning on the waterworks far too many times.
  Negative
With his little porkpie hats and his cheesy 's 'stache and his drunken antics, Pitt has a few choice moments, but like everyone else in this film, hes sunk by the words he has to say and the long, long, LONG stretches where nothing much of anything happens.
  Negative
