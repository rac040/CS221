If Hercule Poirot were alive in the s, wed say he has OCD for sure, what with his fixation on measuring his soft-boiled breakfast eggs to make sure theyre the same size and his frustration with anyone whose tie isnt straight.
  Negative
Wed also say Poirot has no social filter.
  Negative
As the great detective goes about his day, observing everything and missing nothing, he wont hesitate to tell someone to stop talking because youre just making it worse, or telling a new acquaintance, Im just as disappointed with you.
  Negative
He also laughs uproariously while reading 'A Tale of Two Cities,' as if Dickens had written the funniest comic novel ever.

  Negative
Quite the contrary.

Kenneth Branagh is the director and the star of this new adaptation of Agatha Christies time-honored classic Murder on the Orient Express, and never let it be said the director misses an opportunity to place his star front and center, unfortunately relegating just about everyone else in the obligatory International All-Star Cast to a paper-thin character with one or at most two defining personality traits.
  Very negative
They also get one to two scenes apiece to join Branagh in the center of the stage  I mean, in the forefront of the film  to flex their acting muscles and to act surprised or delighted or flummoxed by the great Poirots powers of calculation.
  Positive
Branagh is a world-class actor and a fine director, and he scores stylistic points on both counts here, but this Orient Express loses steam just when it should be gaining speed and racing to its putatively shocking conclusion, which isnt all that surprising  even if you havent read the book or seen the  movie starring Albert Finney and directed by Sidney Lumet.
  Negative
For those who HAVE consumed one or the other, I shant reveal if this edition stays true to the source material to the very end.
  Positive
Keen to take a long holiday after solving yet another crime in spectacular fashion, Poirot boards the Orient Express heading from the Middle East to Europe, and is soon engaged with a number of mysterious and perhaps shady characters, including one Edward Ratchett Johnny Depp, looking pale and uninterested, a corrupt, gun-toting art dealer on the lam from some wronged parties who want him dead dead and dead.
  Negative
Ratchett tries to hire Poirot to watch his back.
  Negative
Poirot says no.
  Negative
He doesnt protect criminals' he solves crimes.
  Negative
Besides, he tells, Ratched: I dont like your face.
  Negative
Not long after, Ratchett is found dead in his cabin.
  Negative
An avalanche has conveniently derailed the Orient Express, leaving everyone trapped on the train and looking over their shoulders as Poirot searches for clues and motive and interviews them one by one.
  Negative
What a bunch.
  Neutral
Michelle Pfeiffer who gives the best performance in the film is Caroline, a beautiful woman of a certain age on the hunt for her next husband.
  Very positive
Penelope Cruz is Pilar, a deeply religious nurse.
  Positive
Josh Gad is Hector, accountant and assistant to Ratchett.
  Negative

  Negative
Daisy Ridley is Miss Marry Debenham, a governess who seems to have a strong connection to Dr. Arbuthnot.
  Negative
Willem Dafoe is the Austrian scientist Gerhard Hardman, who has some chilling views on race and social status.
  Positive
We meet a half-dozen others along the way as well.
  Negative
At least those are the names and profiles first presented to Poirot.
  Neutral
Its not long before he begins peeling away the surface lies and discovering multiple connections to a long-ago, tragic and very famous case involving the kidnapping and murder of a child in America.
  Negative
Branagh the director creates some marvelous visuals, including long tracking visuals where we are outside of the train, peering through the windows at the various characters, and the meticulously appointed dining and sleeping cars on the magnificent train.
  Positive
Branagh the actor cracks off a half-dozen amusing one-liners.
  Negative
The veteran performers are just fine, of course, but the great Judi Dench and the legendary Derek Jacobi are virtually lost in the clutter of characters.
  Neutral
Of the younger set, Ridley and Gad deliver the best work.
  Positive
When finally the Orient Express chugs to a halt and we learn how and why and when the murder was committed, the prevailing thought is:
My dear.
  Negative
It could have been done in a dozen or more so much simpler ways.
  Neutral
