  Negative
Co-directed with a loose, suitably chaotic style by Cary Murnion and Jonathan Milott working from a sharp and sometimes darkly funny script by Nick Damici and Graham Reznick, Bushwick is set in the present day, but its reminiscent of past-generation actioners such as Red Dawn and Assault on Precinct  and Escape from New York.
