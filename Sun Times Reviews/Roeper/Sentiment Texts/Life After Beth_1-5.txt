Meet Life After Beth.
  Neutral
Even most of the fine actors, including Aubrey Plaza, John C. Reilly and Cheryl Hines, at times seem lost as to whether they should be playing the material for laughs, or going for a more straightforward approach and letting the laughs come to them.

Brother Rice grad John C. Reilly and Molly Shannon plays Beths Jewish parents sure, why not, and Dane DeHaan is her boyfriend Zach, who becomes closer with Beths folks Call me Maury, says Beths father as they play a game of chess, stopping by their house and hanging out because nobody else seems to get the depth of Zachs grief.

  Negative
She gets dirty and bloody and grimy, but its a whole lot of makeup work to service a script that needs a whole lot of work.
  Positive
Reilly strikes a peculiar note as Beths father, who would rather not question whether Beth is a zombie or shes resurrected, like Jesus.
  Negative
Really?
  Neutral
Even in a pitch-black would-be comedy, its such a dopey reaction and theres no payoff.
  Negative
Paul Reiser and Cheryl Hines arent given much to do as Zachs parents.
  Negative
A subplot about Zachs relationship with his borderline psychotic older brother, who works for the neighborhood watch, is all yelling and weirdness without much humor.
