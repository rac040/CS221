One of the questions I hear all the time from fellow movie lovers is, Do you ever walk out of a film?
  Neutral
In the case of Jennys Wedding, I was actually watching the movie at home  and yet I STILL considered walking out, to take out the garbage or just wander around aimlessly or maybe get a steaming hot coffee and pour it over my head, if only to feel something other than the numbing disbelief overcoming my very being as I experienced the sheer awfulness of this movie.
  Negative
How can a story set in present day seem so hopelessly outdated?
  Neutral
This clunky dud about a same-sex union would have come across as trite and behind-the-times  years ago, let alone in .
  Very negative
And here I thought Katherine Heigl couldnt possibly star in anything worse than the unholy trifecta of The Ugly Truth, Life as We Know It and One for the Money.
  Negative
Here we go, and dont say I didnt warn you.
  Negative
Heigl plays Jenny, a ish single woman who comes home for a family event and is peppered with questions about when shes going to find a nice man and settle down, because of course in this day and age, if youre THAT old and youre still not married, whats wrong with you?
  Negative
Dont you want to ACCOMPLISH something?
  Neutral
Heres a little hint for Jennys spectacularly clueless family: She and her roommate Kitty Alexis Bledel, who tries really hard to make something out of her part and does a fine job have been sharing an apartment for FIVE YEARS, and neither one is seen with a man.
  Negative
Should we bring out a whiteboard and marker so you can actually connect the dots?
  Positive
Jennys snooty, unhappy, judgmental and thoroughly unpleasant sister Anne Grace Gummer loves to lord her marriage over Jenny, even though Anne is married to a jerk who treats her like dirt.
  Negative
When Jennys Wedding takes a detour into a subplot about Annes struggle, it might actually be more painful than the main story.
  Negative
Anneis convinced Jenny has SOMETHING to hide because she never brings a man around  and she decides, with no evidence whatsoever, that Jenny must be carrying on with a married man.
  Negative
And she's all too happy to share her unfounded theory with everyone, including their parents.
  Positive
century and some sort of land ownership or family legacy is at stake.
  Neutral
In fact the whole town seems far too invested in Jennys personal life  and she goes along with the married man story for a long time, because to acknowledge shes a lesbian in a loving, committed, healthy relationship would be far more shocking and unacceptable to these nosy nincompoops.
  Negative
When Jenny finally DOES come clean, her father says things like, Were ordinary people, not rebels,' her mother disowns her, and the townsfolk gossip in the grocery store, with one busybody saying of Jennys parents, Well, they must have done SOMETHING wrong.
  Negative
I know.
  Neutral
We need look only at that ridiculous Kentucky county clerk to see evidence of modern-day people who are amazingly obtuse about being on the wrong side of history, the law, common sense and basic tolerance.
  Negative
But Jennys Wedding is so heavy-handed and out of step, you almost have to see it for yourself to believe it.
  Negative
If you feel like punishing yourself.
  Neutral
