When people tell me they walked out of the theater or bailed on a VOD selection midway through a movie, theyre describing a foreign experience to me.
  Negative
Obviously, the nature of my duties includes staying until the end of each and every movie  but even before I started seeing films professionally, going all the way back to childhood, I cant think of a single instance in which I took off early.
  Negative
Having said that
I can understand why someone would give up on Brimstone long before this needlessly confusing, pretentious, grisly, nasty, sadistic, dour, ugly, overlong  hours,  minutes Old West gore-fest reaches finally grinds to a halt.
  Negative
Despite the talents of the Dutch filmmaker Martin Koolhoven, a few strikingly effective scenes and the presence of familiar actors Guy Pearce, Dakota Fanning and a couple of Game of Throners in Kit Harington and Carice van Houten, Brimstone is so harsh, so convoluted and so in-your-face with the gruesome imagery, its almost as if Koolhoven is daring you to keep watching.
  Negative
century, Brimstone is divided into four sections with grandiose, biblical titles: Revelation, Exodus, Genesis and Retribution.
  Neutral
It takes a while but eventually we realize events take place out of chronological order, which only serves to add to the headache-inducing nature of the viewing experience.
  Neutral
This aint Pulp Fiction or even The Hateful Eight.
  Neutral
Pearce plays the Reverend, a pure-evil monster of a man who finds ways to justify all manner of horrific behavior, including but not limited to rape, murder, incest, torture of humans and slaughter of animals.
  Negative
The Reverend cherry-picks verses from the Bible and delivers fire-and-you-know-what sermons to justify his actions, but as Pearces admittedly effective, chilling performance constantly reminds us, hes no man of God, hes the devil in religious clothing, manipulating and destroying souls for his own sadistic and sick satisfaction.
  Negative
At one point the Reverend says the decision of who is to live and who is to die belongs to God, and God only.
  Negative
And then he goes back to deciding who lives and who dies.
  Negative
Fanning plays Liz, a young womanmarried to a much older man William Houston.
  Negative
She has a little girl and a stepson.
  Positive
Liz is mute.
  Neutral
Well find out why, in horror movie fashion, later aka earlier in the films jumbled timeline.
  Negative
The Reverend and Liz have a past  a terrible, terrible past.
  Negative
When the Reverend returns to Lizs life, blood will be spilled and hate will rise.
  Negative
Throughout the twisted journey, Kookhoven hammers us with references to heaven and hell and damnation, and the atrocities some men will commit in the name of their God.
  Negative
The time-hopping story includes interludes at a whorehouse in a saloon called Franks Inferno.
  Negative
In one scene, a very young girl is flogged.
  Negative
Twice, women are mutilated in gruesome fashion.
  Neutral
Another character is strangled with his own intestines.
  Negative
And lets not even get into a description of the device the Reverend uses to literally lock up women.
  Negative
Sporting disturbing facial scars and a creepy beard, clad in black, Pearce stirs it up with a strong performance.
  Neutral
Fannings work is on a much smaller canvas, but she does a fine job of conveying Lizs eternal struggles.
  Positive
Brimstone is not a poorly made film, not by any stretch.
  Negative
It has the look and tone and assurance of a legitimate, unforgiving Old West parable.
  Neutral
Its just that for all the visceral depictions of hatred and violence and human destruction, it feels as if the director is chasing his own tail and forgetting about making it all mean something.
