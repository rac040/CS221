When Richard Gere is in the right zone with the right role, he can be a compelling screen presence.
  Positive
Im not just talking about the popular roles inhits such as Pretty Woman and An Officer and a Gentleman and Runaway Bride.
  Negative
One could argue Geres best work is in offbeat, original films such as The Hoax and Arbitrage and Dr. T and the Women.
  Neutral
Sometimes, though, when Gere shifts into Go Big or Go Home mode in offbeat, smaller projects, he crash-lands.

Gere plays Franny, a multi-multi-millionaire with a seemingly endless supply of charm, money and noble causes.
  Negative
Dylan Baker and Cheryl Hines play his best friends Bobby and Mia, and seeing as their fates are sealed in the prologue, its not much of a SPOILER ALERT to tell you Franny is partially responsible for the early exits of Bobby and Mia.

  Negative
When Franny gets a call from Olivia Dakota Fanning, the pregnant daughter of his old friends Bobby and Mia, he springs to life, cutting his hair and trimming his beard, donning a colorful outfit, throwing open the musty curtains, letting light into the room, heading out into the world.
