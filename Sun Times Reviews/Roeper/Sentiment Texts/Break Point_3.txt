Always nice to enjoy a little comfort-food movie in which almost nothing surprising or particularly fresh happens, but were happy to spend time with the characters and we wish them the best as the credits roll.

In this case the film is Break Point, one of those in theaters and on demand movies, and though I often advocate for seeing films the way theyre meant to be seen, i.e., GET OUT OF THE HOUSE AND GO TO THE DANG THEATER AND DONT TELL ME THE MOVIE IS JUST AS GOOD WHEN YOU WATCH IT ON YOUR IPAD, this is indeed the kind of story thatll play just fine on your living room TV.
  Negative
Jeremy Sisto, one of those go-to, steady working actors whos always interesting and deserves more high-profile roles, delivers a laid-back, effortlessly funny performance as Jimmy, a -year-old tennis bum who frittered away his career with reckless play on the court and a hedonistic lifestyle outside the lines.
  Very positive
Jimmy seems to be the last one to realize hes become something of a joke.
  Negative
David Walton has the straight man part and does fine work as Jimmys brother and former doubles partner Darren, a conservative player on and off the court who was crushed when Jimmy dropped him  years previous for a seemingly more talented partner.
  Positive
When Jimmy decides to get serious and make one last run at playing in The Open, he has to talk the understandably reluctant Darren into joining him  and off we go.
  Negative
Its basically a toned-down Tin Cup for tennis.
  Neutral
Who else but J.K. Simmons to play the boys father, a deadpan wisecracker of a veterinarian who is troubled by the estranged relationship between his sons, but not to the point where hes going to take a break from treating all manner of animals with the assistance of the fetching and wonderful Heather Amy Smart, and if you think of one of the brothers has long carried a torch for Heather, well youre up -love already.
  Negative
century presidential candidate and considers Darren to be his best buddy because Darren was his substitute teacher.
  Neutral
Any time theres a movie or a TV show about a grown man whos friends with a boy whos not his relative, theres a risk of uncomfortable weirdness  but director Karas and the team of writers including Sisto, who has a story credit deftly handle the material.
  Negative
Darren becomes a genuine father figure to the kid who of course has an absentee father, and Jimmy doles out some priceless, blunt life advice.
  Positive
They make a great team.
