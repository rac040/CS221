Warning: If you and I are on a flight someday in the near future and I see you watching The Lost City of Z on a handheld device, Im might snatch that thing out of your hands.
  Negative
Fine.
  Neutral
I wont do that because I dont want to star in a viral video titled, Critic Snatches Thing Out of Hands of Person Watching Lost City of Z on Three-Inch Screen, but I cant stress enough how much youll be missing if you dont check out James Grays breathtaking and stunning epic on the biggest screen imaginable.
  Negative
In the tradition of Fitzcarraldo, The Emerald Forest and Apocalypse Now, this is the type of adventure that transports you to a world so exotic and lush and mysterious and dangerous, it feels as if were on a different planet.
  Positive
century became obsessed with finding proof of an ancient but advanced civilization deep in the Amazon.
  Neutral
As portrayed by Hunnam, the British explorer is a smart and forward-thinking visionary, a loyal friend and a loving family man  but hes also self-promoting, self-righteous, ego-driven and forever concerned with restoring the reputation of the family name, which had fallen out of favor among the British upper crust.
  Positive
When we meet Fawcett, hes an undecorated military man who is devoted to his pregnant wife Nina Sienna Miller, excellent but also worried hes running out of chances to boost his career and make his mark on the world.
  Positive
When the Royal Geographical Society of London agrees to fund a two-year mapmaking expedition to the undefined and much-disputed Brazil-Bolivia border, Fawcett quickly assembles his team and basically tells Nina, See you in a couple of years.
  Positive
A bespectacled, thickly bearded, almost unrecognizable Robert Pattinson gives a strong performance as Fawcetts loyal and brave partner-in-exploration Henry Costin.
  Positive
Fawcett, Costin and a small band of hearty adventurers sport crisp outfits, jaunty hats and unbridled enthusiasm when they first set out on the Amazon  but it doesnt take long before theyre exhausted, drenched in sweat, fighting off all manner of insects and sea creatures, and on the brink of starvation.
  Positive
Not to mention the natives whogreet them with hails of arrows so thick they nearly darken the sky.
  Negative
Yet it all seems worth it when Fawcett discovers a few artifacts and carvings pointing to the existence of a lost city populated by an advanced civilization that created pottery, farmed the land using relatively sophisticated methods and built architecturally impressive structures.
  Positive
One of the most entertaining scenes in The Lost City of Z transpires back in London, where Fawcett makes his case in a public forum and is greeted with much derision from British gents whoare threatened by the mere suggestion there might have been a civilization even older and at least as advanced as their own.
  Negative
Why, its blasphemy!
  Negative
With Christopher Spelmans rousing score and cinematographer Darius Khondjis spectacular work setting the tone, Fawcett returns to the Amazon again  and again.
  Positive
He doesnt consider the natives to be ignorant savages' in fact, he greets them with deference and great respect, and asks for their help in guiding him to the ruins of the lost city.
  Negative
The Lost City of Z is filled with remarkable, unforgettable scenes, as when Fawcett and his party stumble upon a makeshift but elaborate opera house run by a rubber plant baron in the middle of the jungle.
  Positive
When Fawcett isnt exploring the Amazon, hes fighting with his mates at the Battle of the Somme in World War I a brutally effective but perhaps not altogether side journey for the film, or attempting to reconnect with this family.
  Negative
It seems as if every time Fawcett leaves, Nina is pregnant, and by the time he returns, the child is walking and talking and doesnt recognize Pops.
  Negative
Sienna Miller has played the understanding wife in film after film and she always adds dimension to the character.
  Positive
As much as Nina supports her husband, she has an adventurous side herself  she even proposes going along on one of the expeditions  and she grows weary of Fawcett saying, We all have to make sacrifices, just before he rides off for another adventure with his colleagues while shes left at home to raise their children on their own.
  Negative
Hunnam expertly conveys Fawcetts bravery, spirit and sometimes reckless nature.
  Positive
At times we sense even he knows he might never find absolute proof of the City of Z  but hell die trying if he must.
  Negative
