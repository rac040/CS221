If Howard Wakefield had been addicted to one TV show in the last decade, I bet it would have been Breaking Bad.
  Negative
I think Howard would have identified with Walter White.
  Neutral
Like Walter, hes a middle-aged man with a lovely, independent wife' two children' a comfortable home, and a seemingly stable and set existence.
  Positive
When Walters life careened into madness and he morphed into an entirely different creature, I could see Howard understanding Walters motivations on some level.
  Negative
Not that mild-mannered attorney Howard Wakefield becomes a feared and legendary meth cooker  but he DOES leap at the chance to reinvent himself while still staying connected to his previous life.
  Negative
Bryan Cranston is the actor who played Walter White and he is the title character in Wakefield, and in this haunting, darkly funny and elegiac mood piece, Cranston once again displays a nearly unparalleled ability to make us like and care about men who are selfish and impetuous and reckless  yet still seem to have a core of decency buried deep within.
  Positive
century short stories and novels by the likes of John Cheever and John Updike  tales of upper-middle-class men of a certain age who had it pretty damn good, but were forever seeking to assuage their sense of unrest and mortality, whether through a bottomless glass, an affair or some other ill-conceived flight of fancy.
  Negative
Wakefield doesnt drink to excess or fool around.
  Negative
He simply drops out of his own life.
  Negative
After chasing a raccoon into the attic above his garage one night, Wakefield discovers he has the perfect vantage point to spy on his own home life.
  Positive
He has Rear Window-type views of the kitchen, the master bedroom, etc.
  Positive
Wakefield decides to spend the night in the attic rather than get into a predictable fight with his wife Diana Jennifer Garner.
  Negative
The next morning, he watches as Diana makes lunches for their twin daughters, sends them off to school, etc., while she clearly must be wondering what happened to Wakefield.
  Negative
Thinking her husband might have come home late and left early for work, Diana calls his law firm in Manhattan and learns he hasnt shown up and no one has heard from him.
  Negative
Diana tries Wakefields cell.
  Neutral
She sees his car is still in the garage.
  Positive
She calls her mother Beverly DAngelo, who rushes over, and she calls the police, and she cries.
  Positive
Wakefield observes all of this, and has a revelation  or should we say breakdown?
  Neutral
In voiceover narration, he rationalizes his decision to take a break from his life, champions himself as a rebel and proceeds to set up camp in the attic, letting his beard grow, becoming disheveled and ratty, scavenging for food and basically becoming a homeless man and a missing person while still spending most nights so close to his family he can practically overhear their conversations.
  Positive
In flashbacks, we learn about Wakefields courtship of Diana  or rather, Wakefield essentially stealing Diana from his best friend Jason OMara.
  Negative
He paints a picture of Diana thats equal parts worship for her tender heart and her consuming love for their children and her great beauty, and resentment for the manner in which she flaunts her attractiveness and flirts with their party guests and picks at him for his failings.
  Positive
What a fine performance by Jennifer Garner, playing a character we see almost totally through the filter of her husbands viewpoint.
  Positive
Its an underwritten role, but in brief moments, often with little or no dialogue, Garner conveys Dianas strengths and her vulnerabilities.
  Negative
As the months wear on, as Wakefields beard grows and he grows more pathetic, Diana begins to reconcile with the likelihood hes gone forever.
  Very negative
It stretches credulity that Wakefield can spend months without being discovered, but just when we're getting restless with the situation and were ready for Wakefield to either fade away forever or return to the family, writer-director Swicord wraps things up.
  Negative
And thats all youre getting from me about the ending.
  Negative
