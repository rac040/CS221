For some reason the gods of stardom have never quite knighted Billy Crudup, even though it could be argued Crudup has the looks, the chops and the charisma to match a Brad Pitt or a Tom Cruise.
  Negative
Crudup seemed poised for stardom after his engaging performance as rock star Russell Hammond in Cameron Crowes Almost Famous, but that was nearly  years ago how can that be!
  Neutral
, and while Crudup has continued to find steady work, he never achieved the kind of stardom that would get a movie made or would get studio execs excited about the opening night grosses.
  Negative
Regardless of Crudups ranking as a box-office draw, hes every inch the movie star in Rudderless, a rather strange but engrossing film with one of the more jarring twists of any film in recent memory.
  Positive
Directed and co-written by the great character actor William H. Macy, Rudderless features as much music  and its wonderful music  as Almost Famous, but this is a very different journey.
  Positive
Crudup plays Sam, a successful advertising executive whose world falls apart after the tragic death of his son.
  Negative
Sam falls into a two-year abyss  losing his job and his home, drinking himself into oblivion and moving to a boat, where he spends his time annoying his neighbors and picking up odd jobs.
  Negative
He lives on a boat, and hes rudderless.
  Positive
Not the most subtle metaphor, but OK.
  Neutral
Felicity Huffman Macys real-life wife plays Sams ex, who tracks him down and gives them a box of their sons possessions, including his guitar, notebooks and some CDs of songs he recorded in his dorm room.
  Negative
At first, Sam wants nothing to do with the reminders of his beloved boy, but eventually he takes out the guitar and teaches himself to play the songs, which leads to an open-mic performance at a local pub, which leads an aspiring musician named Quentin Anton Yelchin to stalk Sam until Sam consents to Quentin forming a band to flesh out the songs.

I slept with the director and got the part,' says Felicity Huffman
Crudup, Yelchin and Ben Kweller perform songs written by Simon Steadman, Charlton Pettus and Ben Limpic, and the result is brilliant, indie-leaning pop-rock, with gorgeous arrangements, lovely lyrics and real heart.
  Very positive
We believe it when the pub begins to fill up whenever the band is headlining, and we believe a record label would be interested in signing these guys.
  Negative
Quentins father was a no-show from the moment the kid was born, and Sam is grieving for his son, who would be about Quentins age, so its easy to see why these two would develop a friendship beyond the music, with Sam mentoring Quentin and Quentin practically worshipping this cool older dude with the amazing song catalog.
  Negative
Theres a reason Sam doesnt tell his band mates about the real author of the songs, and it has nothing to do with Sam wanting to take the credit.
  Negative
In a subplot that really doesnt have much to do with the story other than to provide some chuckles between the music and the heavy dramatic moments, Laurence Fishburne plays a local guitar-shop owner who apparently has been waiting behind the counter for years so he could instantly become Sams best friend.
  Negative
Selena Gomez  yes, Selena Gomez  also has some strong moments as the girl who was dating Sams son in college.
  Positive
And my only complaint about Macys work as the owner of the pub is he didnt give himself a bigger part.
  Neutral
The third act of Rudderless might take your breath away.
  Negative
Its a bold move, and it prompts us to rethink nearly everything that has transpired.
  Positive
Crudup has some of his finest moments as an actor, especially in a scene where he returns to the site of his sons death.
  Positive
This is one of the more memorable films of the year.
  Very positive
