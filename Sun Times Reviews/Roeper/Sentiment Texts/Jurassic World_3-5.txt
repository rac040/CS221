About  percent of the movie is dedicated to the thundering action sequences, with the remaining time devoted to the usual Spielbergian sci-fi thriller tropes, from the siblings who bond because Mom and Dad might be splitting up to an icy adult who learns to love in time of crisis to the obligatory profit-driven villain who refuses to shut things down even as the body count piles up.

How about creating a whole new, super-scary species of dinosaur, containing DNA strands of dozens of creatures?

Fresh off his Guardians of the Galaxy triumph, a chiseled Chris Pratt plays Owen, a former Navy man whos now something of a Velociraptor Whisperer.
  Negative
No kidding  using just a little clicker device, a stern voice and the promise of treats in the form of mice, Owen has a special bond with the Raptors, most notably the one he calls Blue, who communicates with Owen almost as if theyre in a Pixar movie.
  Negative
The moment Owen hears about the -foot Indominus Rex, and how ol Rexy ate his only sibling when he was but a lad, he tells Claire and everyone else theyve made a big, big, big mistake.

  Neutral
Director Colin Trevorrow and the team of screenwriters have some fun turning summer thriller clichs sideways, producing some major laughs as we catch our breath from the action.
  Positive
Howard is wonderful as Claire, who goes from uptight bureaucrat to bad-ass action hero, and Vincent DOnofrio has fun hamming it up as Hoskins, the military strategist who actually thinks it would be a good idea for the U.S. military to use trained Velociraptors as weapons.
  Positive
Im a big Chris Pratt fan, but hes so focused on playing the action hero with a smirk on his face and a hankering for the girl who cant resist his charms, Owen ends up being kind of a stiff.
  Negative
Also, its hard not to look a little goofy when youre pretending to be squaring off against a bunch of Raptors who of course wont really be in the scene until post-production.
  Negative
That said, the special effects are indeed pretty special.
