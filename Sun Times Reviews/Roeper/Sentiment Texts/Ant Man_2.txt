The problem with the Ant-Man movie is they made an Ant-Man movie.
  Negative
Not that it would be impossible to make an entertaining big-screen version of a pretty fascinating comic-book character, but in the modern-day superhero movie library, director Peyton Reeds take on the incredible shrinking fella belongs on the same shelf with the  version of The Fantastic Four, various Hulk misfires and The Green Lantern.
  Negative
This is a lightweight, clich-riddled origins story that veers between inside-joke comedy, ponderous redemption story lines and admittedly nifty CGI sequences that still seem relatively insignificant compared to the high stakes and city-shattering destruction that take place in most of the Avengers movies.
  Very negative
Its reasonable to assume this uneven mixed-bag product is the result of writing credits shared by everyone from Edgar Wright to Adam McKay to Paul Rudd to Joe Cornish.
  Negative
Wright was slated to be the director of Ant-Man but dropped out last year.
  Negative
Joss Whedon says Wrights screenplay of Ant-Man was the best script Marvel ever had.
  Negative
The casting of Paul Rudd as Scott LangAnt-Man seemed inspired  in the vein of Robert Downey Jr. playing Tony StarkIron Man.
  Neutral
Like Downey, Rudd is a likable, verbally nimble performer, and he has his moments as the paroled heist man who is manipulated into becoming Ant-Man.
  Positive
Its just that Lang is nowhere near as tortured, temperamental, narcissistic, horny or focused as Tony Stark.
  Negative
At times hes borderline dull.
  Negative
Theres often room for an iconic actor to play a crusty mentor in these origins stories, and Michael Douglas plays it straight and serious as Dr. Hank Pym.
  Negative
Years ago, Pym developed the technology to enable a human to shrink to the size of an ant' he shelved his work after it led to a devastating personal tragedy.
  Positive
Cut to the present day.
  Positive
Corey Stolls Darren Cross is now running the corporation, and hes hell-bent on picking up where Pym left off, because if men and women can be reduced to micro-size, theyll be the ultimate weapon in warfare.
  Very negative
Millions, no billions, can be made!
  Negative
Again with the ultimate weapon in warfare plot.
  Neutral
Stoll has no room to give Cross any character depth.
  Negative
The guys practically frothing at the mouth from the get-go.
  Neutral
Hes clearly bonkers.
  Neutral
The more he talks, the more we wonder why anyone in the company would listen to this guy.
  Negative
Evangeline Lilly, sporting either a terrible haircut or a terrible wig, plays Pyms daughter Hope, who vehemently objects when her father recruits the talented but small-time heist man Scott to wear the Ant-Man suit and learn the ways of leading an army of ants.
  Negative
In one of the most ridiculous training montages in any movie of any kind, Dr. Pym teaches Scott how to bond with various types of ants and command the ants to move sugar cubes Im not kidding, while Hope teaches him how to fight.
  Very negative
OK.
  Neutral
This is a movie lacking in confidence.
  Negative
References to the Avengers seemed forced and self-conscious.
  Neutral
When Ant-Man is tasked with breaking into an Avengers stronghold, a lone, second-tier character is on security duty.
  Negative
Its as if the movie is saying, All the other Avengers are off on bigger and better adventures!
  Negative
Dramatic moments are undercut by snarky quips, including one scene in which Scott openly acknowledges he just ruined a touching reconciliation.
  Negative
How does that make us like him more?
  Neutral
Every once in a while theres a flash of inspired lunacy, as when Ant-Man and an equally diminutive, size-shifting rival known as Yellowjacket are going at it in miniature, and an iPhone and a childs train set, among other familiar items, come into play.
  Negative
But once you go broadly comedic with such gags, its a bumpy road back to making us feel as if the battle sequences carry any real-world consequences.
  Negative
The always reliable Judy Greer has the usual, too-small Judy Greer role as Scotts ex-wife.
  Negative
Bobby Cannavale plays her second husband, a cop who is extremely slow to catch on that something  weird is going on with Scott.
  Negative
Michael Pena scores laughs as one of Scotts ragtag bunch of petty criminals, who are called into duty to help Scott save the world.
  Negative
Obviously, Ant-Man isnt the first comic book superhero with a creepy andor crawly connection.
  Negative
But Spider-Man pretty much avoids spiders after hes bitten, and while the Dark Knight isnt averse to spending time with bats, its not as if he rides one into battle.
  Negative
Ant-Man can name his flying anthorse Antony and say Good boy!
  Neutral
to his beloved steed, but Antony and the rest of the flying, soaring ants still look like creations in one of those commercials for anti-bug sprays or exterminators.
  Negative
Theyre pests, and thats just a weird place to start for a superhero, especially if he never strays too far from his origins.
  Negative
