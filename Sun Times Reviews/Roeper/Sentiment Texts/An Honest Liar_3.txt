or those of us who despise televangelists who claim to heal the sick in the name of God while trolling for donations, who roll our eyes at mediums and psychics who use time-worn cold reading techniques to claim they can communicate with the dead, who chortle when tricksters claim they can bend spoons and move objects just by concentrating, the Amazing Randi is something of a hero.
  Negative
Because the Amazing Randi has been publicly exposing these charlatans for decades now, often through some elaborate trickery of his own.
  Negative
Directed with style by Justin Weinstein and Tyler Measom, who have done their homework and then some, An Honest Liar chronicles James Randis amazing Amazing!
  Negative
life, from his days as a Houdini-esque escape artist performing on variety shows in the s and s, to becoming such a household name he played himself on an episode of Happy Days, through his retirement as a magician at the age of  so he could devote all his energies, resources and powers of deception to exposing high-profile faith healers and psychics.
  Negative
Oh, and Randi was also the executioner who decapitated Alice Cooper onstage night after night during Coopers Billion Dollar Babies tour in the early s. Just had to mention that.
  Negative
An Honest Liar nimbly skips back and forth between recent interviews with the still-spry Randi, now in his s, and archival footage of some of Randis greatest Gotcha!

moments.
  Positive
Randi worked behind the scenes with Johnny Carsons producers to install some control factors that prevented internationally famous spoon-bender Uri Geller from moving objects without touching them  a huge embarrassment for Geller, and the beginning of a decades-long rivalry between the two.
  Negative
Randi wrote a book exposing Gellers methods.
  Negative
Geller filed multiple lawsuits against Randi.
  Negative
In interviews, Geller sounds like a Bond villain as he continues to maintain he has psychic powers.
  Positive
It doesnt help Gellers case when we see him selling magic crystal jewelry on QVC.
  Negative
Geller seems like a relatively harmless carnival barker compared to the likes of Peter Popoff, one of those evangelical faith healers who could fill arenas with his claims of being able to miraculously cure a variety of ills.
  Negative
Working with surveillance experts, Randi catches Popoff dead to rights.
  Negative
Its an immensely satisfying moment.
  Positive
At times though, Randis methods are questionable, as when he employed and perhaps exploited two young magicians to infiltrate a paranormal research project.
  Negative
Code-named Project Alpha, it was essentially a two-year hoax to expose researchers who were legitimately trying to determine whether psychic powers were real.
  Negative
An Honest Liar loses a little momentum as we get bogged down in the minutiae of the elaborate ruse  and we question whether Randi has crossed the line in order to expose others who have crossed the line.
  Very negative
Even more jarring is the dramatic turn of events in the last third of the film, when we learn a stunning truth about Randis sometimes partner in exposing hoaxes, and romantic partner of  years, Jose Alvarez.
  Neutral
Either Randi was aware of a decades-long deception perpetuated by Alvarez  or the great debunker himself was fooled for a quarter-century by the most important person in his life.
  Negative
Even with my misgivings about some of Randis methods, anyone who can challenges faith healers, psychics and mediums who claim a special bond with the dead  and often wins those challenges  deserves a standing ovation.
  Negative
An Honest Liar is an honest portrait of just that man.
