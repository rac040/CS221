Perhaps the craziest thing about Welcome to Me, the TV show within the movie called Welcome to Me, is it actually might work as a real television show, even though its two hours of a woman with borderline personality disorder focusing on just one topic: herself.
  Negative
Her hopes, her dreams, her grudges, and the key moments from her past that shaped her.
  Positive
Sometimes Alice coaches actors playing the young version of herself and her friends.
  Neutral
Sometimes she extols the virtues of her odd diet.
  Neutral
Often shell reveal stunning secrets about her past, and her current way of life.
  Positive
Peopleclicking around might think theyve stumbled upon an elongated piece of performance art, or the worst and yet most expensive-looking cable access show in the history of television.
  Negative
But its difficult to look away.
  Negative
Hey.
  Neutral
In a universe in which hit shows are made of pawnbrokers, country bumpkins and C-list stars in dancing competitions, whos to say?
  Negative
Kristen Wiig gives perhaps the most impressive performance Ive seen this year as Alice Klieg, a deeply troubled California woman with a deadpan style of conversational delivery she has almost no social filters, and fixations on Oprah Winfrey, swan figurines, the neutering of dogs and foods low on carbohydrates, among other things.
  Negative
Its a tricky business playing someone who is mentally ill and perhaps should be confined for observation, especially in a dark comedy.
  Negative
Wiig manages to make Alice funny as hell, endearing, sad and sometimes a little frightening.
  Negative
Theres not an ounce of condescension or preciousness in the performance.
  Negative
Alice is seriously messed up, and theres no magic cure in store for her, but she just might find the right balance between taking her meds, trying a little harder to assimilate and achieving something close to inner peace.
  Negative
When Alice wins  million in the California lottery, she shows up at a local TV station and announces her desire to write and star in a talk show called Welcome to Me.
  Negative
The only reason they indulge her is the station is in dire need of cash, and Alice is willing to spend millions to get her own show.
  Negative
Alice wants Oprah-like production values and she has very specific ideas about the show, e.g., she will make an entrance on a swan.
  Positive
Not a real swan, mind you, but a vehicle in the shape of a swan.
  Positive
Because remember, Alice loves swans.
  Positive
And television.
  Neutral
Have we mentioned she hasnt turned off her own TV in  years?
  Neutral
Its her electric comfort blanket.
  Positive
Wes Bentley and James Marsden are Gabe and Rich, respectively, the two brothers who own the place.
  Positive
Gabe is quirky and has a heart' Rich is all about the money.
  Positive
Other staffers include the priceless Joan Cusack as a producer-director who becomes something of a mother figure to Alice' and Jennifer Jason Leigh, terrific as a crew member who becomes increasingly concerned Alice is being exploited.
  Negative
We also get Tim Robbins in a sublime and funny performance as Alices therapist, whos so chill we almost expect him to nod off during their sessions, and Linda Cardellini as Alices loyal and long-suffering best friend.
  Positive
Theres nothing not to love about this cast.
  Negative
Working from a script by Eliot Laurence, director Shira Piven sister of Jeremy, daughter of Joyce and Byrne deftly mixes the visual tones of the film.
  Negative
In scenes away from the television station, where Alice meets with her therapist, has dinner with her family including her ex-husband and his gay lover and goes out on a strange date with Gabe, Welcome to Me plays like a straightforward, albeit offbeat, indie movie.
  Negative
But the show within the movie, the show called Welcome to Me, has an entirely different feel.
  Negative
The crew in the control room and the studio audience look on with a mixture of horror and genuine affection, always on edge to see what Alice will do next.
  Positive
She might just sit and eat, she might preside over the actual neutering of dogs, or she might explode in a fit of rage if something goes wrong.
  Negative
Money cant buy Alice happiness, but it affords her the opportunity to express herself on her own terms, inside the very box to which shes addicted.
  Neutral
Theres never a moment when were not worried about her, but thats because weve come to care so much about her.
  Neutral
Alice is disturbed.
  Neutral
Alice is also a treasure.
  Positive
Shira Piven will introduce the  p.m. Friday screening of 'Welcome to Me' at the Music Box Theatre and conduct a post-show Qamp'A alongside co-star Joan Cusack.
  Negative
A portion of the  tickets benefits Piven Theatre Workshop, her family's training center in Evanston.
