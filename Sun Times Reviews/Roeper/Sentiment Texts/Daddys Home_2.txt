Even though Daddys Home is set in the New Orleans area and Sisters is set in Orlando, it feels as if theyre next-door neighbors on Mediocre Boulevard.
  Negative
Like the Amy Poehler-Tina Fey comedy from last week, Daddys Home features a talented and likable duo who have clicked before onscreen.
  Positive
Both films have scenes set in airports.
  Neutral
Both films have segments in which a lovely home is seriously damaged to alleged comedic effect.
  Positive
Both films make the mistake of thinking its funny for one of the main characters to get seriously drunk and act like an abusive, deranged idiot.
  Negative
And both films feel like wasted opportunities.
  Negative
In Daddys Home, Will Ferrell plays Brad, a variation on a Will Ferrell character weve seen a dozen times before: a nice guy whos so aggressively, wonderfully, trying-so-hard nice even the children around him sometimes roll their eyes at his corny wholesomeness.
  Positive
Of course, we know anyone that passive carries inside a strong likelihood to explode one day.
  Positive
Brad is married to the lovely and sweet Sarah Linda Cardellini, criminally underused, who has two young children, Dylan Owen Vaccaro and Megan Scarlett Estevaz, from her previous marriage.
  Neutral
Even though Brad is a caring father figure who puts inspirational notes in the kids lunches, drops them at school every morning, is a scout leader and a coach and signs up for every parental duty under the sun not sure what Mom is doing while Brad seems to be on call , the kids are slow to warm up to him.
  Negative
Little Megan in particular seems to resent Brad, as evidenced by an endless series of drawings in which she kills off Brad in a variety of fashions.
  Negative
Charming!
  Positive
Just when Brad is finally achieving breakthrough status as a genuine stepdad, who shows up but Sarahs ex, Dusty Wahlberg, a muscled-up stud who does some sort of black-ops work for the government and hasnt been a part of the kids lives for years.
  Negative
Dusty has effortless charisma, a modified mullet, cool jewelry, a killer motorcycle and a million stories.
  Positive
Hes the kind of absentee dad who exasperates mom and is worshipped by the children  until they get a little bit older and realize he wasnt man enough to stick around and actually participate in day-to-day parenting responsibilities.
  Negative
Brads an affable buffoon.
  Positive
Dustys a macho schemer.
  Neutral
They square off in a comedic battle for the loyalties of Sarah and the kids, and thats pretty much your movie right there.
  Positive
The competition is absurdly over the top, and you can see some of the gags rounding the corner and heading straight at you, e.g., Brads attempt to ride Dustys aforementioned motorcycle.
  Negative
Once in a great while theres a solid laugh.
  Positive
In an effort to stretch the thin premise to movie-length, the team of screenwriters includes pointless scenes at the Smooth Jazz radio station where Brad works as an executive.
  Very negative
Brads boss, played by Thomas Haden Church, is a creepy, apparently insane fellow who loves to tell stories about his many failed marriages  his way of offering advice to Brad.
  Negative
Every time we get one of these interludes, its as if the movie such as it is comes to a grinding halt.
  Negative
I mentioned earlier this film is set in New Orleans.
  Neutral
The only reason I believe this to be true is because theres a scene where the New Orleans Pelicans host the Los Angeles Lakers, young Dylans favorite team.
  Negative
Its a terrible, obnoxious, cringe-inducing sequence in which Brad behaves so horribly, were actively rooting for Sarah to get a restraining order and never talk to this jerk again.
  Very negative
Other than that, almost nobody in this film talks as if theyre from Louisiana or even seems to realize theyre living in Louisiana.
  Negative
The problem with Ferrells character is he goes from bland to desperate to off the rails  and very little about that transition is genuinely funny.
  Negative
The problem with Wahlbergs character is he never seems all that dangerous or mysterious.
  Negative
Hes also nearly a foot shorter than Ferrell, further mitigating the intimidation factor whenever Dusty gets in Brads face and tries to appear menacing.
  Negative
The problem with the kids is they act and talk like Movie Kids, reciting lines theyve just memorized.
  Negative
Thats one problematic comedy.
  Negative
