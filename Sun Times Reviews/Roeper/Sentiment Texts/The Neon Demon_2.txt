For the second time in two weeks, Ive seen a movie the other coming in future weeks in which a deeply disturbed individual has an intimate encounter with a corpse.
  Negative
Summer Movie Season, : Its not all about the sequels and reboots!
  Neutral
The Neon Demon is a dark-crimson, waking nightmare of a movie, filled with stunningly beautiful and sickeningly horrifying visuals.
  Positive
Its trippy and pretentious and off-putting and occasionally funny, though its difficult to say for certain whether the humor was intentional.
  Negative
For a film so aggressively intent on Big Shock Moments cannibalism and lesbian necrophilia, anyone?

By the time director and co-writer Nicolas Winding Refn stops revving the symbolic engine nearly two hours later, weve seen so manybeautiful young women painted like exotic hookers, stripped of their dignity and their clothes, assaulted, cut open and otherwise humiliated, degraded, mutilated and in some cases executed that Neon Demons undeniable artistry is overwhelmed by the stench of brutality for brutalitys sake.
  Negative
Jesses a seemingly innocent waif with a tragic past.
  Neutral
Shes a pretty girl and she knows it, and the camera loves her  but in the conceit of Neon Demon, Jesse is so spectacular, has so much It Factor emanating from her very being, that jaded casting agents and misogynist photographers are hypnotized by her beauty, and impossibly beautiful and much more sophisticated models are seething with resentment and yet intimidated by the New Girl on the Block.
  Very positive
Its a stretch, but OK.
  Negative
The Neon Demon isnt trafficking in anything resembling the seedy underworld of the modeling business, or for that matter the underworld of any part of the world.

Nearly every frame in the film is presented like something to be hung on a wall and either admired or loathed or maybe a little bit of both.
  Negative
As composer Cliff Martinezs heavy, synthesizer score pulsates and cinematographer Natasha Braier serves up one striking visual after another, Jesse goes deep through the looking glass.

When Rubys not working on fashion shoots, she moonlights at the morgue, painting the faces of the dead.
  Negative
Lets just say Ruby is really into her night job and leave it at that.
  Negative
Bella Heathcoates Gigi and Abbey Lees Sarah are equally vapid, equally dark-hearted and equally beautiful models who are inseparable and always seemed outfitted for an Samp'M shoot.
  Negative
They both speak in deadpan tones and often seem to be staring into the abyss  and theyre both capable of performing unspeakable deeds in the name of surviving just a little while longer in the modeling business.
  Negative
They hate Jesse.
  Negative
Oh how they hate Jesse.
  Negative
Alessandro Nivola sports a porn mustache and a creepy persona as an influential fashion designer who turns Jesse into a budding star.

Christina Hendricks from Mad Men has an effective cameo as a casting agent who signs Jesse on the spot.

  Positive
His noir-thriller Drive contains Ryan Goslings best performance and topped my list of the best films of .
  Positive
Gosling also starred in Refns twisted, Bangkok-set Only God Forgives , a polarizing effort loathed by many but admired by a staunch minority, including yours truly.
  Negative
I love the guys style and boldness.
  Positive
I love how he seems to be influenced by everyone from Kubrick to Tarantino to certain television shows about vampires and zombies and the evils of the night, while continuing to develop his own skill set at a very high level.

Neon Demon is something to look at.

Its gotta lot of bark and a little bit of a bite.
