In the late s and early s, young black men could get stopped and frisked and handcuffed by police just for being young black men.
  Negative
Even when officers were caught on video abusing their power, they werent necessarily brought to justice.
  Negative
In cities where tensions were particularly high, city blocks would burn and conflicts would escalate to riot-levels.
  Negative
How far we havent come.
  Neutral
In some ways Straight Outta Compton is a conventional biopic of an iconic musical force  not so different from Ray or Walk the Line or Whats Love Got To Do With It or Jersey Boys or Get On Up.
  Negative
The early days of dreaming big.
  Neutral
The creative sessions deep into the night.
  Positive
The first big break.
  Neutral
The electric live performances.
  Positive
The multiple explosions of success and fame and money and sex and drugs.
  Positive
The in-fighting and the breakups and the tragedies.
  Negative
All of that is told to great effect in F. Gary Grays enthralling, energized, -minute tribute to N.W.A.  but this is also something of a docudrama about the racial tinderbox that was Los Angeles in the wake of the Rodney King verdict' the ugly, violent feuds between warring rap labels' and N.W.A.s role as rhyming journalists chronicling the times.
  Positive
There was a reason some called it reality rap.
  Negative
When first you see the actor playing the high school student who will become the hip-hop artist known as Ice Cube, the facial resemblance is so startling, the familiar expressions so dead solid perfect, the voice such a perfect match, you might wonder if some sort of CGI magic has allowed the -year-old Cube to play the -year-old version of himself.
  Positive
Its actually Ice Cubes son, OShea Jackson Jr., playing Cube, and what a remarkable performance.
  Very positive
The first time Cube takes the mic and gives voice to his gritty poetry, it feels as authentic as a documentary.
  Positive
And though the actors playing N.W.A. members Dr. Dre Corey Hawkins, Eazy-E Jason Mitchell, MC Ren Aldis Hodge and DJ Yella Neil Brown Jr. dont have the built-in DNA advantage, they all deliver strong, memorable work that transcends mere imitation.
  Positive
The casting in Straight Outta Compton is universally pitch perfect, including brief cameos by Keith Stanfield as Snoop and Marcc Rose as Tupac that are fantastically spot on.
  Negative
As played by Jason Mitchell in a charismatic, ultimately heartbreaking performance, Eazy-E is a charmer, despite his roots as a drug dealer and his casual, careless womanizing.
  Positive
In a callback to Friday, which was directed by Gray and starred Cube, theres a Bye Felicia joke that makes light of N.W.A.s misogynistic ways.
  Negative
The film also makes no mention of Dr. Dres well-chronicled violence against women.
  Negative
Its not as if Straight Outta Compton makes role-model heroes out of the primary members of the group, but it DOES gloss over some damn important negatives.
  Negative
Its Eazy-E who hooks up the group with a hustling manager named Jerry Heller, played by the invaluable Paul Giamatti.
  Positive
Just a couple of months ago, we saw Giamatti as Brian Wilsons infamous managerguru Dr. Eugene Landy in Love amp' Mercy, and lets just say neither portrayal approaches anything favorable toward the real-life subjects.
  Negative
Eventually Hellers favoritism of Eazy-E leads to Ice Cube leaving the group.
  Negative
A nasty but entertaining war of hip-hop words ensues between the remaining members of N.W.A. and the solo Cube.
  Positive
The hulking, intimidating, casually violent Suge Knight R. Marcos Taylor in a chillingly effective performance teams up with Dre to form Death Row Records, and that's effectively the end of N.W.A.
  Negative
As was the case with aforementioned Love amp' Mercy, this is a film that has a real feel for the creative process in the studio.
  Positive
The live performance scenes rock  particularly the depiction of a tense show in Detroit where the group is warned in advance not to perform F' Tha Police, thereby GUARANTEEING the group is going to perform F' Tha Police.
  Negative
In the last hour, Straight Outta Compton stalls just a bit, as we veer from the soap opera melodrama involving various group members to the East CoastWest Coast feud to reminders of hip-hops impact on the culture.
  Negative
Gray has an epic story to tell, one that could have easily filled five or six hours on premium cable.
  Positive
Still, this is one of the better musical biopics of the last  years.
  Positive
