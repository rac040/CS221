In its own cheerfully vulgar, cringe-inducing and consistently raunchy way, Bad Moms is almost as much of a cartoon as the animated hits still populating the multiplexes this summer.
  Very negative
Almost nothing about this movie feels real, including the setting.
  Negative
Were told Mila Kunis Amy Mitchell and her family live in a Chicago suburb  but other than a few sweeping overhead establishing shots of the citys skyline, its pretty obvious the film was actually shot somewhere else, i.e., New Orleans.
  Neutral
Sure, because New Orleans and Chicago ARE the Twin Cities, so alike in architecture, climate and culture.
  Negative
Ah but heres the good news.
  Neutral
Written and directed by the team that penned the Hangover movies, Bad Moms had me laughing out loud even as I was cringing, thanks to some fantastically over-the-top hijinks, crass but hilarious one-liners and terrific performances from Kunis, Kristen Bell, Kathryn Hahn and Christina Applegate.
  Negative
Kunis is funny, sweet and lovely as Amy, married to the charmless lunk Mike David Walton.
  Positive
This clueless mope is a successful professional witness their beautiful and spacious home but hes an absentee father even before Amy kicks him out of the house for having an online affair.
  Negative
Mike barely pays attention to Amy and their two children: the intense and ultra-serious Jane Oona Laurence and little brother Dylan Emjay Anthony, who is said to have a learning disability but is more likely just unmotivated and a tad manipulative.
  Negative
Even though Amy was already doing the vast majority of the parenting, with Mike out of the picture its ALL on her.
  Negative
In addition to Amys high-pressure job at a gourmet coffee start-up, she has to get the kids ready for school, make their lunches, drive them to and from various extracurricular activities, help them with their homework, attend soccer games, tend to their every need, discipline them, counsel them, nurture them and throw herself into a hundred other motherly duties, cuz thats what moms do.
  Negative
Its overwhelming.
  Neutral
Its too much.
  Negative
Yes, given the familys income, Amy could easily hire a nanny or perhaps enlist the help of adult family members, but as weve said  this aint a documentary.
  Negative
Christina Applegates Gwendolyn is the Wicked Witch of the Western Suburbs, the wealthy, judgmental and all-powerful head of the PTA, which in the universe of Bad Moms controls virtually every element of the education system, from the hiring and firing of teachers and coaches to the social lives of the students to which kids are in the starting lineup for the soccer team.
  Negative
Everyone is terrified of Gwendolyn, including Amy  until Amy has a particularly terrible day and she simply cant take it any more, and she explodes at Gwendolyn in front of the entire community, quits the PTA, declares herself a Bad Mom and decides to give herself a break, have a little fun and ground the Helicopter Parenting for a while.
  Very negative
Joining Amy in the impromptu Bad Moms club: Kirsten Bells Kiki, a shy social outcast with four children at home and a husband who treats her like hired help, if you were the kind of person who was dismissive and unappreciative of the hired help, and Kathryn Hahns Carla, a sexually voracious single mom who wears far too much makeup and tight jeans, hits on practically all the married dads, parties hard and truly seems to not give a flying leap about what anyone in this uptight community thinks of her.
  Very negative
Amy, Kiki and Carla go on a suburban mom bender.
  Negative
They eat junk food, they hit the spa, they pound down drinks, they bond over mommy war stories.
  Negative
They get dolled up and hit the town so Amy can meet a man  and who should conveniently show up at the bar but Jay Hernandez Jesse, a gorgeous widow who confesses hes had a crush on Amy from afar for a long time now.
  Negative
How convenient!
  Neutral
Bad Moms is big on the wacky montages and the slo-mo shots of Amy and Kiki and Carla going wild.
  Positive
At times it feels as everyone is stretching to make this a feature-length film.
  Negative
Although I was thinking it could be adapted into a decent half-hour comedy series.
  Neutral
PTA prez Gwendolyn is about as subtle as Dean Wormer as a villain, and her campaign against Amy who decides to run against her in the conveniently imminent election is brutal, cruel and literally felonious.
  Very negative
Meanwhile, the girls male soccer coach none other than football great J.J. Watt, whos actually pretty funny, Amys shallow, sexist boss Clark Duke and the aforementioned soon-to-be-ex husband Mike are all caricatures who are so dumb its a wonder they can tie their shoes in the morning and find their way through the day.
  Negative
The sex talk is frank and then beyond frank.
  Neutral
This movie is NOT first-date material.
  Negative
Its also not take your mom material, unless your mom is Kris Jenner.
  Negative
Some of the dialogue is shock for shocks sake, but much of it is clever and even insightful, albeit on a broad level.
  Positive
Something tells me a lot of good moms will find some real truths contained within the bawdy antics of Bad Moms.
  Positive
