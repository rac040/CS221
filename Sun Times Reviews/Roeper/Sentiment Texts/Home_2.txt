our out of the last five years, Jim Parsons has won the Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, besting the likes of Steve Carell, Larry David, Louis C.K., Don Cheadle, William H. Macy and Ricky Gervais.
  Negative
No offense to Mr. Parsons and the perfectly serviceable The Big Bang Theory, but thats ridiculous.
  Negative
The only thing more ludicrous is Jon Cryer winning the - Emmy for his whiny overacting in the execrable Two and a Half Men.
  Negative
I know.
  Neutral
This is a review of Home.
  Positive
An animated movie.
  Neutral
Not a discussion of the insanely wrongheaded Emmys.
  Neutral
But so much of Home depends on whether you find Jim Parsons, in his comic roles, to be a genius or a likable but essentially one-note actor who recites every line with such gusto it always feels like a performance and never as if hes actually inhabiting a character, whether its Sheldon on The Big Bang Theory or a wide-eyed, insanely eager alien named Oh who has a Yoda-esque way of expressing himself in Home.
  Negative
For me, a little Parsons goes a long way.
  Negative
His character of Oh is meant to be a modern-day E.T., so lovable and so huggable your kids will want to take him home or at least persuade you to buy some Oh merchandise, but halfway through the movie, I was hoping this particular extraterrestrial would phone home  for an interplanetary Uber ride out of here.
  Negative
Oh is a member of a race of aliens called Boovs.
  Positive
He is called Oh because every time other Boovs see him, they say, Oh, as in, Oh, not him.
  Negative
Thats because Oh is a relentlessly cheerful little Boov, so desperate to be liked he almost instantly grates on your nerves.
  Negative
Im with the Boovs on that one.
  Neutral
The Boovs are proud of their standing as the most cowardly race in all the galaxies.
  Negative
Whenever the evil Gorg determines their location and heads their way, the Boovs run for their lives  this time to the planet Earth, where they relocate nearly all the humans in the world to a brightly colored amusement park in Australia.
  Negative
The Boovs think theyre doing the humans a favor, but lets face it: Were talking about an alien invasion in which the native populace is relocated to a prison camp.
  Neutral
Fun setup for a kids movie!
  Positive
Pop megastar Rihanna does fine work voicing Tip, a seventh-grader who was separated from her mother during the Boovian invasion and will do anything to find her.
  Positive
Tip is short for Gratuity.
  Negative
Cant say Im a fan of that name choice.
  Neutral
Why would a loving mother stick her daughter with that?
  Negative
Tips pretty awesome as girl-power role model.
  Positive
Shes smart, funny, sweet and fiercely determined to outmaneuver the Boovs and find her way to her mother.
  Positive
She despises the Boovs, but after a meet-cute with Oh in a convenience store, shes stuck with this particular Boov.
  Negative
Tip needs to find her mom, and Oh is on the run from the Boovs, who blame him for inadvertently revealing their latest location to the dreaded evil Gorg.
  Negative
So off they go on a sweet but very predictable adventure in which they start out as enemies, until they both realize  well.
  Negative
Come on.
  Neutral
Thats hardly a spoiler alert.
  Negative
You know how its going to turn out.
  Neutral
Directed by Tim Johnson Antz and written by Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember adapting the  childrens book by Adam Rex, Home has a bright, candy-colored look, with a few nifty -D effects and some wonderfully detailed sets.
  Positive
Another fun feature: the Boovs change colors according to their moods.
  Positive
Their home color is purple, but theyll go green or red depending on the situation, while other features shape-shift.
  Negative
You can visualize the thousands upon thousands of people-hours that must have gone into the process.
  Neutral
Steve Martin is a hoot voicing Smek, the vainglorious boob who is the leader of the Boovs.
  Positive
Jennifer Lopez lends her voice and a song to the role of Tips mother.
  Neutral
The soundtrack features a number of Rihanna tunes, including the infectious single Dancing in the Dark.
  Positive
The problem is, the story lacks originality and zest.
  Negative
Tip and Oh banter and bicker and bond and banter and bicker and bond.
  Positive
The Boovs hunt for Oh.
  Neutral
Tip yearns for her mother.
  Neutral
Cue another Rihanna song.
  Negative
Anyone over  will see the plot twists a mile away.
  Negative
Kids will probably enjoy the goofy Boovs, the rainbows of colors and the music.
  Positive
Call me a traditionalist, but I still say the world was a better place before those darn Boovs invaded.
  Negative
