If youve ever been to a memorial service where everyone is heartbroken and stricken with grief but there are just as many laughs as tears, just as many moments of wickedly dark humor as heavy sobbing  well, theres your reference point for Manchester by the Sea.
  Negative
This is one of the funniest films about coping with tragedy Ive ever seen.
  Very positive
Not that its a comedy, not for a second.
  Neutral
Its an immensely moving and beautifully resonant drama about the walking wounded and how they cope with a horrific event from many years past.
  Positive
That there are major, legitimately earned laughs to be mined from such heavy material is a testament to the breathtakingly good performances by the cast and the magnificent artistry of the writer-director Kenneth Lonergan, who has crafted a masterpiece, perhaps destined to win multiple Academy Awards.
  Positive
This is a story that in lesser hands could have been mired in melodrama and wrapped up with an audience-pleasing bow.
  Negative
Instead, and to great effect, Lonergan director of You Can Count on Me and Margaret, screenwriter of Gangs of New York has delivered a modern masterpiece reminiscent of the classic, gritty dramas of the s. Its no easy journey, but my goodness is it brilliant.
  Positive
Over the last decade, Casey Affleck has quietly compiled a roster of stellar performances to match just about any actor on the planet, from The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford and Gone Baby Gone both in  to The Killer Inside Me  to Out of the Furnace  to Interstellar .
  Negative
In Manchester by the Sea, he takes it to the next level in an Oscar-worthy lead performance.
  Positive
Affleck plays Lee Chandler, who works as a custodian in a handful of apartment buildings in Boston.
  Neutral
Quiet to the point of being anti-social, Lee fixes leaking showers and clogged toilets, shovels the icy sidewalks  and gets drunk every evening, sometimes ending his night with some arbitrary, self-destructive brawling in a tavern.
  Negative
We dont yet know what happened to this guy, but he might as well be a zombie when it comes to engaging with humanity.
  Negative
In brief, perfectly executed flashbacks, we begin to piece together the life Lee once knew.
  Positive
He was married to the gorgeous, loving and feisty Randi Michelle Williams, and they had three beautiful children, and though life wasnt easy, it sure was sweet and filled with the sounds of laughter and the warmth of love.
  Very positive
Suffice to say all of that is in the distant past.
  Neutral
When Lees brother Joe Kyle Chandler dies suddenly but not altogether unexpectedly  Joe had a heart condition and was told he probably wouldnt live to see   Lee has to return home to Manchester-by-the-Sea to take care of Joes funeral arrangements and to temporarily look after Joes -year-old son Patrick Lucas Hedges until someone takes permanent guardianship of Patrick.
  Negative
The boys mother, an alcoholic who hasnt been a part of his life since he was a little boy, is not a viable candidate.
  Negative
One of the many, many things Manchester gets just right is the dynamic between parents and uncles, and the parents of friends and teenagers.
  Very positive
The adults are convinced theyre much hipper to the ways of the kids than their own parents were, the kids roll their eyes and can barely contain their glee at pulling fast ones on the adults  and the reality is somewhere in between.
  Negative
I loved the moment when Patrick asks his uncle if a girl can stay over, thinking its just a formality.
  Positive
Lee says no, and when Patrick asks why, Lee says, I dont like her.
  Negative
Back in his hometown, Lee is constantly reminded of the tragic circumstances that led to him leaving.
  Positive
C.J. Wilson is terrific as a longtime family friend who welcomes Lee back without judgment.
  Very positive
Tate Donovan is note-perfect in a small role as Patricks hockey coach.
  Negative
Gretchen Mol is outstanding as Patricks mother.
  Positive
Lees plan is to take care of the arrangements for Joe, make sure Patrick is OK and hightail it back to Boston and his empty, numbed-down life as quickly as possible.
  Negative
But complications ensue, and Lee cant leave, at least for a while.
  Negative
He butts heads with Patrick the fights usually subside because Patrick doesnt have his license yet and he needs to Lee to drive him to school and to band practice at his girlfriends house, he tries to find temporary work to make ends meet  and he sees his ex-wife for the first time in many years.
  Negative
In the most devastatingly effective scene in any film of , Randi and Lee bump into each other on the street, and Randi asks for a minute of his time  and before its over, youll have to remind yourself to breathe again.
  Negative
Its maybe the best work Michelle Williams has ever done.
  Positive
On one level, Manchester by the Sea is a small movie, in that its about a handful of people living out their lives in their little corner of the world.
  Negative
With the exception of Lee, who took off for the big city not to chase dreams but to escape a nightmare, just about everyone else in this story wont ever leave the town they were born in and will just try to do the best they can to find love, to have a family, to earn a living.
  Positive
Nobody here is trying to change the world or touch greatness.
  Negative
But theres also something Shakespearean about the scope of the story, and the universal emotions touched upon.
  Positive
Manchester by the Sea is the best movie Ive seen this year.
  Very positive
