Im trying to warn you away from this debacle, so yes I will be revealing SOME plot details about said debacle.
  Negative
Dear future brilliant movie scientists intent on genetically engineering a human-like life form and nurturing that life form as if its your own child:
When that human-like life form begins to act up, dont be idiots.
  Negative
Be scientists.
  Neutral
Realize the experiment didnt work  because according to Movie Law, MAN SHOULD NEVER TRY TO PLAY GOD  and terminate the experiment before the experiment tries to terminate the whole lot of you.
  Negative
From Frankenstein through Westworld through Blade Runner through Ex Machina, have we still not learned that nothing good comes from creating artificial beings that look, behave and begin to act like actual human beings?
  Negative
Morgan is maybe the most infuriating movie of the year, in which the supposedly advanced minds that have succeeded in creating a frighteningly realistic artificial being behave like petulant, stubborn children when things start to go wrong and commit such egregious blunders youll be tempted to throw your popcorn at the screen and bellow, Come ON, you guys!
  Negative
Before were even formally introduced to Morgan, we can see shes a bloodbath waiting to happen.
  Negative
Via security camera footage, we watch as Jennifer Jason Leighs Dr. Kathy Grieff sits down inside a cell-like room with what appears to be a young adult woman in a hooded sweatshirt.
  Negative
That girl is Morgan Anya Taylor-Joy, who has been created via synthetic DNA and is a kind of superhuman non-human.
  Positive
Shes chronologically just five years old but she has the appearance of a teenage girl, the mind of a genius and the physical prowess of a superhero in training.
  Positive
Apparently Morgan has been sad lately and is in a brooding state of mind.
  Negative
Kathy tells Morgan she thought it would be nice if the two of them had lunch together.
  Positive
Morgan responds by leaping across the table with the speed and ferocity of a crazed chimpanzee, and viciously stabbing Kathy in the eye.
  Negative
Go to your room, Morgan.
  Neutral
Kate Mara plays Lee Weathers, a tightly wound, no-nonsense risk management consultant with the powerful and quite possibly nefarious global corporation that bankrolled the Morgan experiment and now wants her to decide if they should continue with their investment or pull the plug.
  Negative
Lee arrives at a remote, bunker-like camp that contains the labs and living quarters for a handful of doctors and researchers  as well as the glassed-in, glorified cell where Morgan has been housed since sheit was created a half-decade ago.
  Neutral
With black eyes that seem to look right through you, an unnervingly calm way of expressing herself, an almost condescending way of dealing with her human creatorscaptors, a love of classical music and a mind clearly capable of elevated if not empathetic thought, Morgan is like the granddaughter Hannibal Lecter would have loved to death.
  Positive
Or vice versa.
  Neutral
In addition to Kathy, who is tripping on massive doses of painkilling drugs and is sporting a blood-soaked gauze eye patch hello, doctors, infection?
  Negative
, the tightly knit band that has lived on the compound for more than five years includes:
 Dr. Ziegler Toby Jones, the mastermind behind the creation of Morgan.
  Negative
Hes a twitchy, sweaty, seemingly paranoid fellow.
  Negative
Dr. Brenda Finch Vinette Robinson and her husband, Dr. Darren Finch Chris Sullivan.
  Neutral
They tell Lee they regard Morgan as their daughter.
  Neutral
Not toooooo creepy.
  Neutral
Dr. Lui Cheng Michelle Yeoh, who makes vague references to Helsinki and a similar humanoid experiment that resulted in the deaths of two dozens of her colleagues.
  Negative
The amiable Ted Michael Yare, who shows Lee around the compound, and Skip Boyd Holbrook, a dreamboat whose sole function is cooking fabulous meals for the scientists.
  Very negative
Im surprised Skip doesnt have Alien playing on the TV in the kitchen, as both homage to the similarities between characters and the fact Morgan is directed by Ridley Scotts son Luke.
  Negative
Dr. Amy Menser Rose Leslie from Game of Thrones, a behavioral psychologist who clearly has a thing for Morgan, and yes, Id say its crossing a few ethical lines for a doctor to have a serious crush on a five-year-old, A.I. creation who looks like a high school girl.
  Negative
From the get-go, its abundantly clear Morgan isnt quite right  and yet time after time, doctor after doctor does something really stupid to exacerbate the problem.
  Negative
It gets to the point where you almost WANT to see bad things happen to these people.
  Negative
Kate Mara is a fine actress, but if whether its the script or Maras performance or a combination thereof, only someone who has fallen asleep for the bulk of the film will be surprised by what we learn about Lee.
  Negative
The great Paul Giamatti lends some spark as the worlds most arrogant psychologist, who is brought in to analyze Morgan and thinks hes firmly in control of a situation in which he is slowly but obviously losing the upper hand.
  Negative
Scenes in which characters holding weapons keep saying things like, Dont come any closer!
  Negative
instead of firing the weapons dont help.
  Neutral
The hand-to-hand combat sequences are cut so rapidly theyre nearly unwatchable.
  Negative
The only thing worse than the first three-quarters of Morgan is the supposed payoff, which veers from the dumb to the really dumb to the so-dumb-youll-hardly-believe-it.
  Very negative
This is one of the worst movies of .
  Very negative
