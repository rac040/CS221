Brutal.
  Neutral
Tommy Lee Jones The Homesman is a stark and beautiful and bleak portrait of life in the Midwest in the s.
  Positive
The Nebraska territory is so unforgiving, conditions so harsh, you wonder why anyone chose to live there.
  Very negative
This is more of a Midwestern than a pure Western, and it contains not an ounce of romance about the time period.
  Negative
Theres no majestic score, no choreographed gunfight, no scene where the hero walks into a saloon in the middle of the day and its filled with gamblers, roustabouts and women of ill repute.
  Very negative
The Homesman is a film about women who go mad after having to bury their children, ranchers barely eking out a living and bargains that are struck in the name of survival.

  Negative
Ill leave the horrific circumstances of each to be discovered by the viewer.
  Negative

  Neutral

  Negative
This is Tommy Lee Jones second feature film as a director.

The first was the excellent The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada in .
  Positive
The first passages in The Homesman include flashback sequences showing us how those three women played by Grace Gummer, Mirando Otto and Sonja Richter lost their minds.
  Negative
Its almost like a horror film.
  Neutral
When Jones first appears onscreen as a lowlife squatter who calls himself George Briggs it appears to be a name hes made up on the spot, theres an almost slapstick tone to scenes in which hes nearly blown up and then left perched on his horse with a noose around his neck.
  Negative
It defies credulity that the pragmatic Mary Bee would enlist this jokers help, but the crusty, craggy-faced George, while lacking a moral compass, has clearly faced the elements over many a decade.
  Negative
Mary Bee knows she and the women will almost certainly die if they try to make this treacherous journey on their own.
  Negative
With George along for the ride  he agrees to the task after Mary Bee promises shell withdraw  from a bank in Iowa once the journey is completed  they have half a chance.
  Neutral
Jones the director goes back to harsh realism for the middle section of the film, in which Mary Bee and George are nearly constantly at odds with one another while battling the elements, trying to keep the women from running away or doing harm to themselves and fending off unfriendly strangers they encounter along the way.
  Negative
The trip is marked by some huge surprises and a few small moments of warmth and humor sprinkled in here and there.
  Very positive
Every once in a while a familiar face pops up for a scene or two: Meryl Streep, Hailee Steinfeld, Tim Blake Nelson, James Spader.
  Negative
All are terrific, but Spader is particularly memorable, creating a character  a hotel operator  who in just a few quick scenes leaves us wanting to see an entire movie about him.
  Positive
Jones, as one would expect, is brilliant playing the kind of cuss hes played many times before.
  Very positive
Swank creates a character who is sweet and kind and deeply religious and strong, but more than a little sad and sometimes appearing to be on the verge of succumbing to the same madness that has afflicted the women shes caring for.
  Neutral
The Homesman is not an easy, comfortable viewing experience.
  Negative
Thats part of what makes it unique.
  Positive
