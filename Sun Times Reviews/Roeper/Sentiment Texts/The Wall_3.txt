This is a monster movie disguised as a war movie.
  Negative
Set in the middle of Nowhere, Iraq, in late , with the war officially over but blood still flowing, The Wall is a psychological stalker-and-prey thriller pitting a wounded American soldier against an unseen Iraqi sniper.
  Negative
Through a convenient plot contrivance, the soldier and the sniper are able to communicate on a local frequency, giving rise to a verbal chess game occasionally punctuated by manic action sequences involving piercing bullets, gushing wounds and guttural screams of anguish and despair.
  Negative
We meet Sgt. Allen Ize Isaac Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Staff Sgt. Shane Matthews John Cena as theyre in full camouflage on a hillside,  hours deep into surveillance of the scene of a massacre of eight Americans  contractors and security detail on a small construction site.
  Negative
Ize speculates this could be handiwork of a pro, maybe even the legendary and some say mythical sniper known as Juba.
  Negative
Could Juba be lurking behind the crumbling remains of a makeshift stone wall down there?
  Negative
Shane, exhausted and exasperated and impatient to the point of overconfidence, announces hes going down to the scene to see whats what.
  Negative
Moments later, a shot rings through the dusty desert air, and its on.
  Negative
In one of the films many white-knuckle bursts of action, Ize makes a mad dash down the hill while Jubas bullets rain down all around him.
  Negative
Wounded and in a state of near-hysteria, he finds cover behind the wall, just a few yards from where his partner lies face down in the desert, suffering from multiple wounds and on the brink of death.
  Negative
Ize frantically calls for help  but the voice on the other end of the line turns out to be the sniper.
  Neutral
Its no coincidence, that nickname of Ize.
  Negative
This soldier uses a malfunctioning visual scope because of its connection to a fallen comrade.
  Neutral
And Ize never actually lays eyes on the sniper hidden somewhere out there, taunting him on multiple levels.
  Negative
The back-and-forth between Ize and the sniper sometimes reminded me of the give and take between John McClain and Hans Gruber in the first Die Hard, or the conversations between Colin Farrell and his unseen tormenter in Phone Booth.
  Negative
Ize relies on background audio cues, e.g., the flapping of loose sheet metal, to help him figure out just where the sniper is hiding.
  Negative
In the meantime, the sniper pries so deep into Izes psyche and seems to know so much about him, there was a moment when I wondered if these radio calls were the figment of Izes fevered imagination.
  Negative
Given the universal nature of the conflict, director Doug Liman The Bourne Identity, Edge of Tomorrow might well have set this in an unnamed foreign territory during an unspecified time.
  Negative
The Wall is hardly political commentary, although there are a few not particularly subtle touches, as when we learn that crumbling wall was once part of a school.
  Negative
Really?
  Neutral
Because there doesnt seem to be another structure, or even the skeleton of a structure, for as far as one can see in any direction.
  Negative
Cenas hulking, wisecracking Sgt. Matthews spends much of the film unconscious or out of frame, essentially making The Wall a two-character thriller in which we see only one of the main characters.
  Negative
Aaron Taylor-Johnson delivers a strong performance as the likable but flawed Ize' he could be the former homecoming kingfootball star turned soldier from any of a thousand American towns.
  Positive
Laith Nakli meets the challenge of creating the character of Juba purely via a voice heard through an earpiece.
  Negative
Its a wickedly effective performance.
  Positive
Its a wise choice to never show the sniper.
  Positive
Like the killer in Phone Booth and the entity in Lights Out and so many villains of all forms through the decades, the longer we go without seeing the tormenter, the more terrifying he becomes.
  Negative
