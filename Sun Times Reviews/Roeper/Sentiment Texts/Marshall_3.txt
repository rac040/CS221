You wont find much subtlety in the solid period-piece drama Marshall, but you will find plenty of crowd-pleasing courtroom theatrics, some wonderful performances from the main players  and yes, all sorts of reminders of how far weve come in terms of race relations since the early s, and how very, very far we still have to go.

Get On Up.

As the young Thurgood Marshall, a brilliant and passionate civil rights attorney who will be the first to tell you just how good he is and he wouldnt be bragging because its the truth, Boseman delivers perhaps his finest work to date  even when the material falters a bit and is more heavy-handed and pound-the-point-home than necessary.
  Positive
Directed by Reginald Hudlin House Party, The Ladies Man, who at times cant resist the urge to stage comically rewarding but obviously exaggerated confrontations and payoffs, Marshall is not a sweeping epic about the life and times of the legendary Thurgood Marshall, who argued the landmark Brown vs. the Board of Education case in  and became the first African-American justice of the U.S. Supreme Court in .
  Negative
Rather, its a courtroom thriller inspired by the true story of a sensational and incendiary case that proved to be a pivotal moment in Marshalls career.
  Positive
The year is .
  Neutral
In a case with cinematic echoes of the entirely fictional story of To Kill a Mockingbird, the NAACP sends Marshall to Connecticut to defend Joseph Spell Sterling K. Brown, a black chauffeur accused of raping and trying to murder his employer, the socialite Eleanor Strubing Kate Hudson.
  Negative
Marshall doesnt have a license to practice law in the state of Connecticut, but the judge James Cromwell rules he can sit at the defense table and offer notes and counsel to Josephs attorney  as long as he doesnt speak a single word.
  Negative
Through a series of contrivances we neednt bother to outline, a local civil attorney with no criminal defense experience, Sam Friedman Josh Gad, is essentially given no choice but to represent Joseph, with Thurgood guiding him every step of the way.
  Very negative
At first Sam wants nothing to do with the case and he explores every possible avenue to get out of it  but as a Jewish man living with his family in a community where theres no shortage of anti-Semitism, during a time when a monster in Germany is committing genocide against Jews, it doesnt take long for Sam to identify with Joseph, to believe in his innocence, and to place his entire career and future in hands of Thurgood.
  Negative
Boseman and Gad have a terrific rapport straight out of a buddy movie.
  Negative
Whereas Thurgood is a dynamic legal mind and a handsome, dashing, room-commanding social presence, the portly and unassuming Sam is a smart but cautious sort when it comes the law, and the kind of fellow who is invisible when HE walks into a restaurant or a party.
  Positive
Its the Sam character that gets most of the laugh-inducing and applause-getting movie moments.
  Positive
At times Thurgood is little more than a straight man for Sams theatrics.
  Negative
These were not my favorite scenes in the film.
  Negative
Props to Josh Gad for seizing his spotlight moments without ever overplaying his hand and making Sam a caricature.
  Negative
I loved his work in this film.
  Very positive
Kudos as well to Kate Hudson for her work as Eleanor Strubing, a complicated and deeply troubled character, and well leave it at that.
  Negative
Hudson has the opportunity to play some classic and somewhat clichd courtroom testimony scenes, and she is more than up to the task.
  Positive
Sterling K. Brown who played Christopher Darden to great effect in The People vs. O.J. Simpson has a couple of outstanding moments as Joseph, who has lived a far from exemplary life but maintains his innocence even when hes offered favorable plea bargains.
  Positive
James Cromwell is James Cromwell, so of course he delivers as the old-school judge.
  Positive
But its up to Boseman to carry the story, and that he does.
  Positive
When we think of Thurgood Marshall, I would venture the first images most of us see are of an immensely accomplished elder statesman in a justices robe, his visage worthy of a spot on Mount Rushmore.
  Positive
Marshall reminds us that before the legend, there was the badass young warrior.
