Few actors in the world are better suited to play a gluttonous pig than Gerard Depardieu, and I mean that in the best possible way one can make such an assertion.
  Negative
I mean, the man looks like hes one more sexual encounter or rich meal away from keeling over from an overdose of living high on the hog.
  Negative
In Abel Ferraras lurid, sometimes grotesque, train-wreck-watchable Welcome to New York, Depardieu almost literally fills the screen as an enormous bear of a man with insatiable appetites for money, sex and power.
  Negative
The characters name is Devereaux, but he is clearly based on the former IMF chief and one-time French presidential hopeful Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who in  was arrested in New York on charges he had assaulted a hotel maid in his suite.
  Negative
Although the charges were subsequently dropped, mostly because prosecutors were concerned about the accusers credibility, Strauss-Kahn did agree to a settlement with the alleged victim for an undisclosed amount in a civil suit, was implicated in a number of other scandals, saw his reputation reduced to tatters and was divorced by his wife, Anne Sinclair.
  Negative
Devereaux arrives in New York City on business, but first theres the business of orgiastic indulgence.
  Negative
When Devereaux enters his hotel suite, a couple of sleazy, unnamed male associates and a number of prostitutes are already in full party mode  guzzling booze, snorting drugs, consuming one another.
  Negative
Devereaux dives in with gusto and engages in a marathon party session  and once it winds down and the women have taken their leave, he starts all over again with two NEW exotic escorts, who will do whatever he says because hes the man with the cash.
  Negative
Ferrara chronicles Devereauxs debauchery as if hes making an unrated sex film the director has protested cuts that were made to give Welcome to New York an R rating, but after an encounter with a hotel maid that Devereaux claims was consensual but the maid claims says was rape, the film make a drastic switch in tone.
  Negative
As Devereaux is detained at JFK Airport, gets locked up in a holding cell, submits to fingerprinting and mug shots, and endures casual taunts and rough treatment at the hands of cops, it all plays out like a procedural, almost a documentary.
  Very negative
Theres a flicker or two of sympathy for Devereaux, who pleads to make a phone call and is humiliated by cops joking about his girth and his, um, manhood  but were quickly reminded of WHY hes under arrest in the first place.
  Negative
What Devereaux is enduring doesnt add up to  percent of the pain his victim allegedly suffered.
  Negative
Ferrara and his co-writer, Chris Zois, leave little doubt about what happened in that hotel suite.
  Negative
In this inspired by true events fictional drama, the powerful man from France is guilty as sin, and guilty of countless sins throughout his adult life.
  Negative
But, given Devereauxs status as one of the most influential and wealthiest men in the world, theres considerable doubt as to whether the punishment will fit the crime.
  Negative
Jacqueline Bisset is a force as Devereauxs wife, Simone, a woman of considerable class and ambition who knows full well of her husbands dalliances  but is appalled and disgusted when he is charged with rape.
  Positive
She doesnt seem all that concerned about the victim, but she IS horrified her husband has thrown away everything theyve worked for because he cant control his impulses.
  Negative
When Devereaux is placed under house arrest, Simone sets up camp in a three-story, ,-a-month townhouse in Tribeca.
  Negative
Ferrara filmed in the actual home DSKs wife rented in .
  Positive
In one of the movies most powerful scenes, Devereaux turns to his wife for sympathy  but she reads him the riot act in devastating fashion, reducing him to the pathetic man-child he truly is behind all the trappings of his wealth and power.
  Positive
The more we learn about this Devereaux, the more we feel Welcome to New York could well have been titled, Good Riddance.
  Negative
