With Mission: Impossible  Rogue Nation, were getting the best Bond movie since Casino Royale in .
  Negative
OK, so Ethan Hunt isnt James Bond and the Impossible Missions Force isnt MI, but the MI films are essentially Bond movies, with a touch of Bourne and a whole lot of Tom Cruise doing what he does best  looking about  years younger than his true age Cruise recently turned , performing harrowing stunts, engaging in clever banter with his adversaries, and doing it all with just the hint of a smirk that tells us even when it appears certain Mr. Hunt is facing imminent death, hell find a way to free himself from the clutches of even the most dastardly, sneering villain.
  Positive
Because hes Hunt.
  Neutral
Ethan Hunt.
  Neutral
Believe it or not, its been  years since the first Mission: Impossible, a high-powered mess directed by Brian DePalma.
  Negative
With the fifth installment of the franchise, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie matches the style and edge of Mission: Impossible III , directed by J.J. Abrams, and Brad Birds Ghost Protocol .
  Negative
This is the rare instance of the later movies in a series easily exceeding the quality of the original.
  Very positive
In Rogue Nation, we get the classic spy-out-in-the-cold scenario.
  Negative
The great Alec Baldwin hams it up nicely as Hunley, the gruff and fantastically clueless head of the CIA, who forces the IMF out of existence because thats what gruff and clueless government bureaucrats do in movies like this: They refuse to listen to logic and disregard the facts because they dont care for these hotshot rogue typeswhodont follow protocol.
  Negative
Just because IMF has been disbanded doesnt mean Hunt will relent in his pursuit of The Syndicate, a mysterious and some say purely mythical organization of former good-guy operatives now working in the shadows to spread evil and blow things up and kidnap world leaders and BRING THE WORLD TO ITS KNEES, BAHAHAHAHAHA!
  Negative
Rebecca Ferguson does stellar work as the beautiful and deadly and alluring Ilsa Faust, an agent who also might be a double agent and could even be a double-DOUBLE agent.
  Positive
Ilsa and Ethan exchange smoldering glances even as Ethan is trying to decipher whether shes trying to kill him or save his life, but theres no time for romance in Rogue Nation, not with so much intrigue and suspense lurking around every corner.
  Negative
Much has been made of Cruise doing his own stunt work in an amazing sequence in which Ethan clings to the side of a Russian cargo plane as it takes off from a Minsk runway, and it IS a fantastically ludicrous sequence  but its not even the second best action set piece in Rogue Nation.
  Very negative
Director McQuarrie stages a beautifully shot, extended scene in the Vienna State Opera house in which Ethan must outwit, outlast and out-shoot multiple potential assassins.
  Positive
Its reminiscent of Hitchcock  or the aforementioned de Palma when the latter was doing his best Hitchcock impersonation.
  Neutral
Just breathtaking, thrilling action cinema.
  Very positive
Later, Ethan and Ilsa team up to breach a seemingly impenetrable fortress that includes a secure underwater tank.
  Negative
They need to do this because they have to switch a code so Ethans sidekick Benji Simon Pegg, excellent comic relief can access a facility in order to, you know, thwart the bad guys.
  Negative
At times the deception and the intrigue and the twists and turns make it nearly impossible follow every detail of the plot, but even when things get muddled, we know Ethans our hero, and we know well eventually learn the true intentions of Ilsa and the rest of the players.
  Negative
One relatively weak spot: Sean Harris Solomon Lane isnt a particularly memorable villain.
  Negative
Hes medium-insane and he loves to taunt Ethan, but he looks about as frightening as your accountant after a long weekend.
  Negative
Its an interesting move to go with such a meek-looking bad guy, but I just don't find Lane all that chilling or memorable.
  Negative
Jeremy Renner and Ving Rhames turn in fine performances as Ethans fiercely loyal teammates.
  Positive
Simon McBurney is absolutely brilliant as a British Intelligence official with questionable motives.
  Positive
Of course, this is Cruises movie, Cruises franchise  and Ethan Hunt has become one of the signature characters of his -year career.
  Negative
