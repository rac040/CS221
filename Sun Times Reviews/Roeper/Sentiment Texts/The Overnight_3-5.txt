Watching The Overnight is a little like taking in a game when Los Angeles Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw is on the mound.
  Negative
No really.
  Neutral
The delivery is unorthodox.
  Positive
You might think you know whats coming, but then comes another curveball that catches you by surprise.
  Neutral
Youre kept guessing throughout  and its a real kick when youre wrong yet again.
  Positive
Writer-director Patrick Brice has fashioned a sharp, quite nutty, offbeat gem with some of the most hilarious sexual hijinks in recent memory and some keen insights into the mindset of youngish parents who are devoted to their children but are also trying desperately to hang on to their self-perceived coolness.
  Neutral
They dont want to be defined by their mom- and dad-ness.
  Negative
Theyre still up for anything!
  Positive
Well.
  Neutral
Maybe.
  Neutral
Such great casting in this film.
  Positive
Adam Scott so terrific as Ben Wyatt on Parks and Recreation, master of the tightly wound straight man character, plays Alex, and Taylor Schilling Orange Is the New Black is his wife Emily.
  Negative
This sweet, happily married couple with a wonderful little boy has just moved from Seattle to a trendy section of Los Angeles, and theyre feeling a little lost and overwhelmed.
  Positive
Its not just their son who needs to make new friends' Alex and Emily are isolated as well.
  Negative
Enter Kurt Jason Schwartzman, a hipster-looking guy who sees his child bonding with Alex and Emilys son at the park and invites them over to his house that evening for pizza.
  Negative
Schwartzman consistently strikes unique and dryly perfect notes as Kurt, who has an oddly charming way of communicating.
  Very positive
Its socially seductive, but a small part of you wonders if this guy is in a cult or has stored body parts in a freezer in his garage.
  Positive
When Alexand Emily arrive at Kurts address, bottle of Two-Buck Chuck wine in hand, its one curveball after another.
  Negative
For one thing, Kurts house is a sprawling mansion that looks like it belongs to the owner of an NBA team or an Internet multi-millionaire.
  Negative
Then theres Kurts wife Charlotte Judith Godreche, a beautiful and sophisticated French actress who specializes in a certain kind of film Im not going to describe, other than to say I believe this is the first time in mainstream movie history such a film career has been examined.
  Positive
Its not what you think it is.
  Neutral
Unless you have a frighteningly creative imagination.
  Positive
Kurt and Charlotte seem like wonderful parents.
  Positive
The kids are getting along so famously, the pizza party turns into a sleepover.
  Neutral
Kurt sings them to sleep with a beautiful lullaby.
  Neutral
What a guy!
  Neutral
Once the kids are safely tucked in and fast asleep, The Overnight turns into a surreal odyssey in which Kurt bonds with Alex, and Charlotte bonds with Emily, and then all four of them bond  but again, maybe not like youd expect.
  Negative
Theres some fantastically startling full-frontal nudity' much drinking and pot smoking' more drinking and pot smoking, and multiple occasions in which Alex and Emily huddle up to discuss and debate the situation, and whether they should call it a night or keep going and see where the adventure takes them.
  Negative
The Overnight reminded me a little of Bob amp' Carol amp' Ted amp' Alice, a commercial and critical hit from  about two Los Angeles couples contemplating a foursome.
  Negative
Brices movie has much more of an indie tone than Paul Mazurskys film and of course these are very different times  but in both instances, the titillation factor is merely the vehicle for substantial and authentic observation.
  Negative
All four leads in The Overnight are outstanding.
  Positive
Schwartzman takes his familiar persona  the guy who keeps you off-balance and just might be a jerk but maybe he isntand gives it a fresh twist.
  Positive
Scotts performance is bravely self-deprecating.
  Negative
Schillings double takes and triple takes are sublime.
  Positive
Godreche takes what could have been a clichd character and makes her three-dimensional.
  Neutral
This is one terrifically twisted parental play date.
  Negative
