The legendary Panamanian boxer Roberto Duran has lived a life  and had a fight career  far more complex and polarizing than what we see onscreen in Hands of Stone, but this is still one of the more entertaining boxing pictures of the last decade.
  Positive
Im not saying this isnt a solid picture.
  Negative
Im just saying if you enjoy this film but you dont know a ton about Duran, wait until you read up on him and watch documentaries such as Roberto Duran: Beyond the Glory or ESPNs  for  titled No Mas.
  Negative
Ah, but as we often say when we review fictionalized films about real-life subjects, the bulk of our attention must be paid to the movie as a movie and not as a historical document about the individuals and events portrayed  and as such, writer-director Jonathan Jakubowiczs Hands of Stone is a rousing, well-filmed and solid if at times overly generous to Duran biopic with a bounty of charismatic performances, two of the sexier scenes of the year, some welcome laughs and a few above average fight sequences.
  Positive
Among the films strengths:
Edgar Ramirez in a true star turn as Duran.
  Positive
From the moment we see the street kid in bell bottoms strutting through the streets of Panama through his meteoric rise to adored world champion to his self-destructive bouts with gluttony, his hedonistic excess, his misogynistic rants and the moment in the ring when he brought shame upon himself and his country, Ramirez captures the essence of the enigmatic Duran.
  Neutral
century.

The pop star Usher, aided by just the right amount of prosthetics, turning in a brilliant supporting turn as the dashing, fleet-footed, charismatic and well-spoken Sugar Ray Leonard  who is everything the illiterate Duran is not, and is the perfect villain, or is it hero, to go up against Roberto in two epic bouts in .
  Positive
Leonard and Duran actually fought a third time, in , when both were well past their primes.
  Negative
Hands of Stone wisely ignores that lackluster bout.
  Negative
War Dogs, in a fiery performance as Durans sexy and independent wife, Felicidad, who puts up with his nonsense and puts up with his nonsense  until she doesnt.
  Neutral
Great work all around.
  Positive
Writer-director Jakubowicz lays it on pretty thick with the flashback sequences showing a young Roberto swiping mangoes so his family can eat while Americans retain control over the Panama Canal Zone.
  Positive
And even as an adult, Duran retains a seething resentment for the gringos because his American father who was in the military was never part of his life.
  Negative
As depicted in Hands of Stone, Duran isnt as paranoid and outside-the-ring violent and hurtful to those who love him the most as is De Niros Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull  but coming in second to that lout is no prize.
  Negative
This is a boxing movie where at times we find ourselves rooting AGAINST the main character when he steps into the ring.
  Negative
Though to its credit, Hands of Stone notes it wasnt Leonards proudest moment either when he taunted Duran and showboated to the point of clownish behavior when he was dominating their rematch.
  Negative
To this day, Duran insists he never said No Mas!
  Negative
No more!
  Neutral
, when he turned his back on the dominating Leonard in the eighth round of their World Welterweight Championship rematch bout in  and quit in the middle of the fight, stunning the boxing world.
  Positive
Duran never seemed to understand that was never the point.
  Neutral
It wasnt whether he SAID No mas.
  Neutral
Its that he quit.
  Neutral
To Durans credit, he did climb back into the ring, and he did win back the love of the Panamanian people and the respect of the boxing world  and then about three more movies worth of stuff happened in his life.
  Positive
In the meantime, we have THIS movie, and as such, its a solid TKO.
