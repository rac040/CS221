Pitt looks great, is enjoying a huge life on the global stage and remains an international movie star.
  Very positive
By the time Errol Flynn was , he was a scandalized has-been more than a decade past his prime, suffering from myriad health problems, nearly broke, marinating in a sea of booze, self-administering morphine and heroin  and in the throes of a two-year relationship that began with statutory rape when the girl was just .
  Negative
This sordid tale is chronicled in The Last of Robin Hood, a late s period piece that plays in a minor key its clearly not a big-budget production, tempering some of the more lurid details of the scandal.
  Very negative
It lands just this side of camp, with a perfectly cast Kevin Kline hamming it up as the aging bounder Flynn, and Susan Sarandon really hamming it up as the peg-legged, hard-boozing Florence Aadland, who started pushing her daughter Beverly to get into showbiz right around the time she was pushing Beverly in a stroller.
  Positive
Beverly Aadland Dakota Fanning was just  when Flynn spotted her on the Warner Brothers lot while he was playing John Barrymore in Too Much, Too Soon.
  Negative
Indeed.
  Neutral
Even though Flynn had narrowly avoided jail when he was acquitted of rape in the s, he is not a man who learns from his mistakes.
  Negative
Flynn forces himself on Beverly and then begins courting her, if you can call it that.
  Neutral
Flynn quickly ascertains the way to Beverlys heart is through her domineering mother Flo, so he works his creaking but still considerable charms on Flo  flattering her for being such a wonderful mother, listening intently as Flo tells the story of her own crushed showbiz dreams I got a callback on a Fred and Ginger movie, inviting her to come along with him and Beverly on Hollywood outings and even on a trip to New York, where Flo can no longer pretend she doesnt know the nearly -year-old Flynn is sleeping with her underage daughter.
  Positive
As Flo hobbles about on her one good leg, downing vodka and boasting to everyone about her friendship with Errol Flynn while pressuring Flynn to boost Beverlys career, Beverly just wants to go out and stay in with Flynn.
  Positive
Dakota Fanning brings little spark to the role of Beverly, who seems marginally talented at best and not very interesting.
  Negative
Of course shes cute, but theres no fire to Fannings performance, whether its in the tepid love scenes with Kline or the increasingly volatile exchanges with her blabby mother.
  Neutral
Even with Flynns notorious reputation and self-destructive lifestyle, we dont see much of an argument for why he would risk spending the rest of his life in prison for this girl.
  Negative
Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland, who co-wrote and co-directed, are also a bit too easy on Flynn.
  Negative
We get glimpses of his manipulative ways  in one scene, Flynn sprinkles drops of water on a letter to make it appear as if hed been crying while writing to Beverly  but the man was a predator in an ascot.
  Negative
Klines performance is so winning that The Last of Robin Hood sometimes seems to lose sight of that.
  Positive
A couple of scenes are pitch-perfect, as when Flo is reluctant for all of about six seconds before she begins spilling every last detail of the scandalous relationship between her underage daughter and the fading movie star, or when Flynn meets with Stanley Kubrick Max Casella, who wants Flynn to play Humbert Humbert in Lolita, a negotiation that falls apart because Flynn insists Beverly play the lead.
  Negative
As Kubrick tells Flynn, thats a problem, because not only is Beverly not the most talented actress, shes already too old for the part.
