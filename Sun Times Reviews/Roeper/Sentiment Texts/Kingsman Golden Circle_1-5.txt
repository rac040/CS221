If a white towel had been handy as I screened the punishingly long and dreadful Kingsman: The Golden Circle, I would have thrown it at the screen and made a wish:
Please make it stop.
  Negative
Please stop with one Academy Award winner after another playing cartoonish and cardboard characters sporting wigs and costumes that look like they were retrieved from a back closet of the Saturday Night Live prop department as they spout ridiculous and often painfully unfunny dialogue.
  Negative
Please stop with the trying-way-too-hard pop culture references.
  Neutral
Please stop with the stylized, slow-mo, cheerfully violent car chases and shootouts and hand-to-hand combat sequences.
  Negative
Please stop with the scatological humor and the broad stereotypes about American country bumpkins and the casual sexism and the tired James Bond satire and the dopey names for characters and the arbitrary plot twists and the insanely implausible reveals about certain characters.
  Negative
Also, its surely just a coincidence and one cant blame the filmmakers for not knowing what everyone else is up to  but this is the THIRD action movie this year to feature John Denvers Annies Song, the third movie this year to incorporate Denvers Take Me Home, Country Roads, and the second movie in the last two months to have Channing Tatum in the cast AND have a pivotal scene in which a character sings that latter tune.
  Negative
Thats just weird!
  Negative
Even the quieter, lets-take-a-breath scenes in The Golden Circle are irritating.
  Negative
At one point, quite deep in a film with a massively bloated running time of  hours and  minutes, two main characters agree to share a martini, for old times sake.
  Negative
One guy makes the drink.
  Neutral
In real time.
  Positive
The other guy waits for him to finish.
  Neutral
They talk about nothing.
  Neutral
They sip their martinis.
  Neutral
The conversation continues to go nowhere, until a third character arrives mercifully, for our sake and for all intents and purposes announces its time to return to the movie.
  Negative
How is that NOT a deleted scene?
  Neutral
Its not even worthy of inclusion on some future home video release with bonus footage of previously unreleased material.
  Negative
Kingsman: The Secret Service  director Matthew Vaughns outlandish and yes, sometimes quite offensive adaptation of the popular British action comic book series about an ultra-secret society of agents.
  Negative
It was cheeky.
  Positive
It was crazy.
  Neutral
It was cool.
  Positive
Vaughn returns for the sequel, and within the first  minutes he makes it clear Golden Circle is going to be bigger and louder than the original.
  Positive
We get a mad and violent and heavy on the CGI chase scene set to the tune of Princes Let Go Crazy  and when it finally comes to an end, theres about a -second pause before we get ANOTHER ambitious and over-the-top chase sequence.
  Negative
Taron Egerton returns as Eggsy, aka Galahad, who was the protg of the legendary spy Harry Hart Colin Firth in the original.
  Negative
In wardrobe and eyeglasses and demeanor, Eggsy is essentially a younger version of his dearly departed mentor, who was shot point-blank in the head and killed in the first Kingsman adventure.
  Negative
Or was he?
  Neutral
Its hardly a SPOILER ALERT to say Harry makes a return in Golden Circle, given Colin Firths presence in the ads and on the posters for the movie.
  Negative
Julianne Moore is about as good as it gets most times around, but she gives an off-key and off-putting performance here in a thankless role as Poppy, a bizarrely upbeat global drug kingpin based deep in the Cambodian jungle.
  Negative
Poppy grew up in the s and she loved the nostalgia craze for the s as popularized in movies such as American Graffiti and TV shows such as Happy Days, so her compound includes an old-fashioned diner and a retro movie theater, and her henchmen wear lettermans jackets.
  Positive
Um, OK.
  Neutral
After Poppy masterminds a devastating and massive strike against the Kingsman organization, leaving only a few survivors, Eggsy and the unflappable Scottish agent Merlin Mark Strong discover theres an American counterpart to their organization known as the Statesman.
  Negative
Off they go to Kentucky, to find out whats what.
  Negative
Jeff Bridges plays Champ, the head of the Statesman.
  Negative
Halle Berry is an underappreciated tech guru known as Ginger Ale.
  Negative
Channing Tatum is the Statesmans resident bad boy, called Tequila.
  Negative
Pedro Pascal seems to be channeling mid-s Burt Reynolds as the agent known as Whiskey.
  Negative
So weve got Colin Firth, Julianne Moore, Jeff Bridges, Halle Berry  thats FOUR Oscar winners taking out this trash.
  Negative
Not to mention Sir Elton John, Academy Award winner for best original song, who plays himself in this movie and scores a couple of laughs before his extended cameo wears out its welcome.
  Negative
One of the worst crimes a sequel can commit is to create a scenario that undoes or renders irrelevant key moments from the original.
  Negative
Hello, later Terminator movies.
  Negative
Kingsman: The Golden Circle commits that offense, among many, many other injustices.
  Negative
Despite the admittedly arresting visuals, including some beautifully eye-popping attention to detail and color in many a scene, this is actually quite an ugly film.
  Negative
If you liked the original, the best way to preserve that memory is to stay away from this sequel.
  Positive
