If youre in the right frame of mind for a lurid, blood-soaked B-movie with an A-list cast, Triple  is just the ticket.
  Negative
Just about every scene features an Oscar winner or an Oscar nominee or an Emmy winner andor a first-rate character actor  and just about every scene is a bloody mix of taut thriller and utterly implausible noir plot point.
  Positive
This is a sordid but slick and gutsy mess that comes across like a cover-band version of a Michael Mann movie.
  Very negative
Take one step back and analyze the proceedings, and Triple  holds up about as well as a house of cards in a hurricane.
  Positive
Press Pause on your Credibility Meter and just go with the flow and enjoy the fantastically unsubtle performances and the delicious revenge plot twists you can see coming a mile away, and maybe youll be entertained as I was, even as you acknowledge this thing is fabulous trash.
  Negative
Were told early on Triple  is set in Atlanta, Georgia, United States.
  Negative
I love it when movies tell us a scene is set in Paris, France, or Jupiter, The Fifth Planet from the Sun, or 'Atlanta, Georgia, United States.'
  Neutral
As interpreted through the lens of the Australian director John Hillcoat who helmed the vastly underrated Depression-era crime film Lawless in  and the deeply cynical screenplay from Matt Cook, the Atlanta of Triple  is only slightly less chaotic than the Atlanta of The Walking Dead.
  Negative
Most of the law enforcement characters are dirty or strung out on drink and drugs' gangbangers dominate their respective neighborhoods' hookers and junkies stumble about in broad daylight' and oh yeah, the Russian-Jewish mob, which one character actually calls the Kosher Nostra, is the most powerful entity in the city, with crooks, local cops and even a number of federal agents in its pocket.
  Positive
Check out this list of players, and I wont have room to get to everyone.
  Negative
Anthony Mackie is the corrupt but morally conflicted cop Marcus Belmont, while Clifton Collins Jr. is the corrupt and utterly psychotic cop Jorge Rodriguez.
  Negative
Theyre dirty through and through, and theyre part of a crew that includes Chiwetel Ejiofor as criminal semi-mastermind Michael Atwood, Norman Reedus as Russell Welch and Aaron Paul as Russells brother Gabe Welch.
  Negative
After an extended and well-choreographed bank heist reminiscent of the aforementioned Michael Manns Heat, the crew actually finds itself in deeper with the Russian-Jewish mob.
  Negative
Im not going to delve into the reasons WHY theyre now in deeper with the Russian-Jewish mob, because if I try to explain every convoluted plot tributary in this movie, Ill run out of space and Ill have to tweet about  tweets to lay it all out for you.
  Negative
And none of us wants that.
  Negative
Guess whos running that mob?
  Negative
Why, its none other than Kate Winslet, sporting a s Sharon Stone hairdo and flexing a pretty great Russian accent as Irina Vlaslov.
  Negative
As were told in one of the many expository scenes designed to keep us up to speed with the tangled madness unfurling before us, Putin himself was so afraid of Irinas husband he threw the guy in the gulag four years ago  so now the ruthless Irina is running the show and is hell-bent on gaining possession of certain files that will guarantee her husbands freedom.
  Negative
Because of course no one would think to make COPIES of those certain files.
  Negative
But wait, theres more!
  Negative
Turns out the criminal crew chief, Michael, was once married to Irinas younger sister Elena Gal Gadot, soon to be Wonder Woman in a theater near you, and they had a son together, and Irina uses the boy as a pawn to keep Michael in line.
  Negative
Meanwhile, Casey Afflecks Chris Allen is the new partner of the corrupt cop Marcus, and Woody Harrelson is Chris Uncle Jeffrey, a detective with a serious drinking problemand did I mention Michael Kenneth Williams, known for playing the baddest of the bad on The Wire and Boardwalk Empire, plays a transgender madam known as Sweet Pea?
  Negative
Nobody in Triple  really sees every piece of the big picture puzzle.
  Positive
Some characters understand about  percent of whats going on' others hover around the  percent mark.
  Negative
Were the ones with the omniscient perspective.
  Neutral
This isnt one of those cop thrillers where were kept in the dark until the final act.
  Negative
Even the surprise moments arent much of a surprise if youve been paying attention.
  Negative
In a real world filled with urban violence and gang warfare and, yes, a small percentage of police officers whoare corrupt, Triple  might not feel like escapism for some, and I get that.
  Negative
But this thing is such an R-rated cartoon and so far removed from reality  like a slick but intellectually calorie-free video game  theres no shame in being entertained by it.
  Negative
