s soon as the credits rolled on Predestination, I wanted to watch it again.
  Negative
It was even more of a mind-dance the second time around.
  Neutral
More than a half-century after the publication of the great Robert A. Heinleins trippy, twisted and brilliant -page short story All You Zombies, the Spierig Brothers have pulled off a nifty feat by expanding it into a meticulously crafted, sparse but beautifully photographed full-length feature film with strong work from a reliable veteran and a breakout performance from an actor you might not have heard of before.
  Positive
Ethan Hawke, who deserves first-ballot entry into the Mustachioed Actors Hall of Fame, gives a strong, nuanced, film-noir-nod performance as the Barkeep as hes billed in the credits, a temporal agent who can journey through time to prevent crimes before they happen.
  Negative
There are limits to how far he can travel, which might explain why he never bumps into the agents from Minority Report.
  Negative
In the New York City of the s, the Barkeep is on the hunt for the terrorist known as the Fizzle Bomber when theres an explosion and hes burnt beyond recognition.
  Negative
Some seven years later, hes now tending bar in a seedy joint, where he strikes up a conversation with an androgynous-looking man named John Sarah Snook.
  Negative
After a bit of banter where we wonder if the Barkeep knows John or John knows the Barkeep or theyre two strangers both hiding agendas, John tells the Barkeep he has a backstory that will blow his mind.
  Negative

I want to tread lightly here so as to keep most of the twists and revelations tucked away, but lets just say John used to be known as Jane, and JaneJohn has been on one long strange trip.
  Negative
When John was a Jane, she was recruited by Space Corp., a secret government program to put women in outer space for reasons other than what the women were led to believe when they signed up.
  Negative
When John finishes his story, the Barkeep is indeed blown away  but then he offers John the opportunity to go back and literally change his destiny.
  Negative
Predestination yanks us back and forth through the decades, going back as early as  and spending a lot of time in the s and s and s, with a brief stop in the s. Along the way, were told a few rules of time travel there are always a few rules of time travel, including the familiar caveat that one must not step outside the mission at hand or interact with too many people at any given point on the timeline.
  Negative
Just because youve landed in the spring of  doesnt mean you can warn JFK not to go to Dallas that November, and even if you did who would believe you?
  Negative
The deeper we go, the more insane the story gets, leading to one of the more bizarre endings in recent movie history.
  Negative
Even if you see it coming, it doesnt make it any less weird.
  Negative
Working on a budget of just  million, the Spierig brothers and their team have created a visually arresting film with cool, stark, bleak sets' great use of color to indicate different time periods, and special effects that do the trick even though the whole film was made for the cost of probably a minutes worth of a big-budget superhero movie.
  Positive
Hawke gives one of his best performances, leaving us guessing throughout as to the true motivation of the Barkeep and whether hes a good guy or maybe not.
  Positive
And then theres Sarah Snook, an Australian actress in her mid-s who is stunningly good in a role that requires her to play a dashing young man, a world-weary man of about , a homely girl, a beautiful girl and lets leave it at that.
  Negative
She bears a slight resemblance to a young Jodie Foster, and she is utterly natural and believable on screen, even when her characters situation is anything but natural or conventionally believable.
  Positive
In a scene where Jane receives some shocking news, Snook is heartbreakingly effective.
  Positive
Its the first great performance of the very young movie year.
  Very positive
