It speaks volumes for the sheer ferocious awesome insane greatness of Mad Max: Fury Road that Im not even ticked off about Tom Hardy getting stuck wearing a face mask for a good chunk of the film.
  Positive
I mean, come on!
  Negative
This guys one of the best actors of his generation, and its the Bane of my existence to see him once again get the Dark Knight treatment.
  Positive
Let the man be seen and heard.
  Neutral
Then again, we can always hope Hardyand the equally badass Charlize Theron team up again for a dialogue-driven character study.
  Neutral
For now lets be grateful theyre one of the best action duos ever, in one of the best action movies.
  Very positive
Ever.

Mad Max: Fury Road is a stunningly effective post-apocalyptic fable, a chilling and yet exhilarating daytime nightmare pitting blindly loyal and bloodthirsty half-humans against implausibly beautiful people clinging to their sense of morality while doing whatever they can to stay alive.
  Positive
In an action movie world dominated by cartoonishly over-the-top CGI effects and rapid-fire quick cuts, its exhilarating to see so many set pieces and battle sequences filmed in unbroken tracking shots, some breathtaking wide angle views and visceral, gritty close-ups.
  Positive
Mad Max maestro George Miller, returning to the franchise that marked his directorial debut in , says  percent of the effects seenonscreen are practical, i.e., sans computer-generated imagery or post-production wizardry, and the result is an action movie so much better than most, it almost qualifies for its own genre.
  Very negative
My best guess is Fury Road sits on the timeline somewhere between The Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome, with Hardy picking up the blowtorch from Mel Gibson as Max Rockatansky, who is haunted by terrifying, Shining-level visions of the daughter he couldn't save.
  Negative
Now Max slogs his way through a vicious, blood-spattered desert world, with only one goal: survival.
  Negative
Even if you havent seen any of the original Mad Max films, Fury Road works as a stand-alone piece.
  Positive
After an opening chase sequence more ambitious and visually stunning than the climactic scenes in most big-budget action films, Max is held captive in the Citadel, a canyon city in which the great unwashed masses await commands and rations of water from the all-powerful and all-hideous Immortan Joe, a ghoulish sicko with a skeleton face mask and his own personal harem of supermodel-gorgeous breeders.
  Negative
In a nice touch, Hugh Keays-Byrne, who was the infamous Toecutter in the first Mad Max movie, plays Joe.
  Negative
As for Max, hes literally a human blood bag  a universal donor hooked up to an IV to provide fuel to Nux Nicholas Hoult, one of the hundreds of young War Boys feverishly devoted to the cult of Immortan Joe.
  Negative
The War Boys sound like brainwashed terrorists, spouting verbal garbage about the glories of reaching the gates of Valhalla where they will be born again under the approving eyes of Immortan Joe.
  Negative
Theyre half-mad warrior-fools.
  Neutral
Once Max is sprung from the Citadel  what, you thought Mad Max would spend the whole movie bound and gagged and held as a slave?
  Negative
he forms a partnership-of-necessity with Imperator Furiosa Charlize Theron, imposing and beautiful and magnificent with her buzz cut and her black eye makeup, who has gone rogue with her precious cargo: thousands of gallons of Guzoline, and Immortan Joes harem of beauties, one of whom is pregnant with his child.
  Positive
About those women.
  Neutral
Theyre so ridiculous its great.
  Negative
Rosie Huntington-Whitley is the Splendid Angharad, Zoe Kravitz is Toast the Knowing, Abbey Lee is the Dag, Riley Keough is Capable and Courtney Eaton is Cheedo the Fragile.
  Very negative
So there!
  Neutral
They wear strips of white linen fabric and they look as if theyre on their way to a shoot for Vogue, but each has her own special brand of toughness and resilience.
  Negative
And given that Max often takes a passenger seat to Therons Imperator Furiosa, this is one female-empowered action vehicle.
  Negative
Once Max and Furiosa are on the run with Immortan Joes fleet giving chase, Fury Road is one extended warring sequence after another, punctuated by pauses so Max and Furiosa can learn just a little bit about one another, and we can catch our breath.
  Negative
What a feast for the eyes and the adrenaline.
  Positive
The war rigs are hybrids of muscle cars, tanks, drag racers and land-speed rocket ships.
  Negative
War Boys spray silver paint on their mouths and cackle madly.
  Neutral
Enemy soldiers on motorcycles fly through the air like futuristic X-Gamers on PEDs.
  Negative
Warriors sway back and forth on long poles, swooping in for the kill and then bouncing away like Velcrod vaulters.
  Negative
Furiosa and Max devise ingenious defense plans on the fly.
  Positive
Immortan Joes fleet includes minions literally banging on gigantic drums, and a thrash metal guitarist strapped to the front of a truck, just because.
  Negative
Its all perfectly, wonderfully, fantastically crazy.
  Positive
Amidst all those ingenious, power-packed road warrior sequences, Fury Road contains a surprising amount of depth and character development.
  Positive
Theres not a whole lot of dialogue, and yet Max, Furiosa and Nux experience something akin to growth.
  Negative
Fighting like animals against creatures with not a speck of conscience, they tap into their own humanity.
  Positive
