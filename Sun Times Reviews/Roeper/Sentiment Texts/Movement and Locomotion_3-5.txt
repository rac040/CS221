At first Bodine Bolings work as a semi-hipster, do-gooder Brooklynite named Kim in Movement and Location comes across as so disjointed and odd it seems almost amateurish  but the more we know about Kims backstory, the more impressive the performance.
  Negative
Non-spoiler of a spoiler alert: On the surface, Kim is a -year-old woman living in present-day New York City, but shes actually a new arrival from about  years into the future, which explains why shes not exactly familiar with the mannerisms, speech patterns and social mores of our time.
  Negative
Kim might as well be an alien from another planet.
  Neutral
In fact, Bolings work reminded me a little of Jeff Bridges memorable portrayal of a humanoid alien in Starman.
  Negative
At times this film also reminded me of John Sayles The Brother from Another Planet.
  Positive
No wonder why Kims answers to questions about her personal life and her family history, as well as her reactions to some surprising developments in her life, sometime feel a little flat, as if shes not quite sure what to do.
  Very negative
She isnt.
  Positive
We know little about the world from which Kim has escaped, other than there have been drastic changes over the last  years and things are less than idyllic  and if you manage to hitch a ride to the past, its a one-way ticket, because the technology of that future doesnt allow for a return.
  Negative
Once Kim lands in the Brooklyn of , some four centuries before her birth, shes here for life.
  Neutral
Kim works for an outreach program for homeless adults, helping them to get off the park benches and taking them to safe places where they can find food, shelter and hopefully a new path.
  Neutral
But when she encounters a -year-old street kid named Rachel Catherine Missal with whom she shares a common bond, her new life on Earth is turned upside down.
  Negative
How far will Kim go to protect her secret?
  Neutral
Kim has traveled in time, but she has no superpowers and no means of proving her true origins.
  Negative
She knows if shes arrested or subjected in any way to detailed scrutiny, her story wont hold up and shell be locked up.
  Positive
Why is she REALLY here?
  Negative
And what will happen when the truth hits the fan?
  Neutral
Kim launches into a romance with a good-hearted cop Brendan Griffin as a means of shielding the truth, but then she develops feelings for the guy, and shes conflicted about what to do next.
  Neutral
In the meantime, she has to fend off the increasingly suspicious probes of her co-worker Haile Owusu and her roommate Ana Margaret Hollyman, who finally realize her story doesnt add up.
  Negative
And then things get REALLY complicated.
  Negative
Written by lead actress Bodine Boling and directed with a steady hand by her husband Alexis, Movement and Location has some clear-cut parallels to the stories of immigrants who are in the States illegally and are trying to live quiet, productive lives without anyone asking too many questions.
  Negative
But it also works as a Rod Serling-esque sci-fi adventure of the mind, devoid of special effects but convincing us of its dimension-breaking elements through the use of dialogue, performance and music.
  Negative
