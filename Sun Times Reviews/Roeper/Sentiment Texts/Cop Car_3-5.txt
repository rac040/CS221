In the span of just  minutes, Jon Watts throwback thriller Cop Car takes us on a pulse-quickening ride involving a corrupt sheriff, two adult brothers who apparently were mixed up in some seriously bad business  and those two boys, who have decided to run away from home and find themselves in the middle of a deadly game of cat and mouse.
  Negative
Were not sure why those boys are running away.
  Negative
We dont know the circumstances that led to two men tied up in the trunk of that cop car.
  Negative
We dont know the backstory of the sheriff, and why he has a secret stash of cash, weapons, gold bars and false I.D.s at home.
  Negative
All we know is it might be something of a miracle if anyone gets out of this story alive.
  Negative
Cop Car opens with a scene of Travis James Freedson-Jackson and Harrison Hays Wellford gleefully blurting out various obscenities as they hop along a vast prairie framed by a mountain range and a seemingly endless sky.
  Negative
Theres a little bit of Terrence Malick in Watts penchant for beautifully framed moments that stretch.
  Positive
And stretch.

Unmanned, unlocked.

Cut to earlier that day, and theres Kevin Bacons Sheriff Kretzer behind the wheel of that cop car, sporting a military buzz cut, sunglasses and a semi-ridiculous mustache, driving deep into that field to conduct some nefarious business.
  Negative
Sheriff Kretzer is comically dumbfounded when he returns to the spot where he parked his car  and there aint no car.
  Negative
As Bacon flails about like a silent movie actor, he perfectly announces Kretzers character: Hes dangerous and cunning, but hes no genius.

Watts achieves a kind of early Coen brothers, early Tarantino feel.
  Positive
In one darkly twisted comedic moment, the boys fumble about with automatic weapons, unable to figure out how to release the integrated safety mechanisms.

  Negative
Yikes.
  Neutral
The sheriff desperately improvs one move after another, all for the goal of getting back to that car before someone else gets to the boys.
  Negative
Bacon is all smarmy charm as he manipulates the police dispatcher and figures out a way to communicate with the boys without anyone else listening in.
  Neutral
Camryn Manheim shows up as the local crackpot busybody, who swears she saw two young boys swerving down the highway in a cop car.
  Negative
Shea Whigham Nucky Thompsons brother Eli on Boardwalk Empire, playing a nasty guy with a blood-crusted face who was sure hed be dead before the day is done but now has a chance to survive, makes the screen pop in every scene hes in.
  Negative
Kevin Bacon is reliable as ever.
  Positive
If you had to watch every film and TV show of any one American actor in his s, you could do a whole lot worse than going with Kevin Bacon.
  Negative
