The list of truly memorable movies about track and field is a short one, including Chariots of Fire, Personal Best, Saint Ralph, Without Limits and a handful of others.
  Positive
Maybe its because you can only do so much cinematically with many of the disciplines.
  Neutral
While the long jump and the hurdles and the pole vault and the marathon can be exciting to watch in person or on TV, how do you create intense fictional drama from these events?
  Positive
Even a close race can be filmed only so many ways, whereas the winning touchdown pass or a dramatic home run in the bottom of the ninth or a last-second goal can take on myriad forms.
  Negative
Race tells the story of a brave and gifted and determined man who accomplished great feats during a pivotal moment in world history  but its a by-the-numbers sports biopic with little nuance and a penchant for saccharine-soaked dramatic moments.
  Positive
Probably the best thing about the film is Stephan James strong performance as Jesse Owens, the legendary sprinter and long jumper who begangaining national acclaim as a high school athlete.
  Positive
Race concentrates primarily on the years  and , when Owens was tearing up the track at Ohio State University and then of course starring for the U.S. at the Berlin Olympics of   much to the disgust of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party.
  Neutral
Unfortunately, the casting of Jason Sudeikis as Ohio State track and field coach Larry Snyder is a major misstep.
  Negative
Sudeikis is a versatile talent capable of switching gears from comedy to drama, but theres a certain lightweight quality to this performance that doesnt seem to jell with the gravitas and the complexities of Snyder.
  Neutral
The coach is a raging alcoholic, but hes also a wonderful mentor to Jesse and a fierce defender of equal rights at a time when blacks werent allowed to even try out for the Ohio State football team.
  Negative
This is a rich, complex character  or at least it should be.
  Positive
Director Stephen Hopkins pulls out all the stops to get us invested in Owens greatest moments, e.g., a Big Ten meet in  in Ann Arbor, when Owens set three world records and tied a fourth within a -minute period.
  Positive
The music swells.
  Neutral
The public address announcer seems to be talking more to us than the crowd as he tells us about each event and how amazing it is that Jesse is doing what hes doing.
  Positive
James does a fine job of mimicking Owens running style and jumping styles.
  Positive
Its all quite competent  just not very involving.
  Positive
A man jumping into a sand pit, followed by officials using a tape measure to ascertain just how far hes leapt, simply isnt in the same dramatic league as a boxing match or a football game.
  Negative
When we move on to the  Olympics, the relatively simplistic storytelling continues.
  Neutral
We get an unnecessary albeit well-acted sequence with Judge Jeremiah Mahoney William Hurt, president of the Amateur Athletic Union, calling for U.S. boycott of the Games, with American Olympic Committee president Avery Brundage Jeremy Irons arguing in favor of American participation.
  Negative
We know the U.S. participated, so whats the point?
  Negative
Barnaby Metschueat hams it up as the snarling snake Joseph Goebbels, while Carice van Houten plays the documentary filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl as a sassy, fearless dame who showcases Owens superiority over the Germans and every other competitor, even though of course it doesnt fit Hitlers pre-conceived narrative.
  Negative
In real life, the German athlete Carl 'Luz' Long gave Owens some advice for the long jump, was the first to congratulate Owens for winning Long took silver and walked arm-in-arm with Owens as they walked off the track.
  Negative
In Race, the beginning of this beautiful friendship is depicted in such a hokey manner it doesn't do justice to history.
  Negative
Occasionally Race delivers, especially in a late scene reminding us when Owens returned to the States with four gold medals and the great honor of having humiliated Hitler, he not only didnt get a heros welcome  he was often treated like a second-class citizen.
  Negative
Theres a memorable movie to be made about the amazing, inspiration and controversial life of Jesse Owens.
  Positive
This is not a bad film and its a decent history lesson for those that dont know the story of Owens and the  Games, but its a long, long way from greatness.
  Negative
