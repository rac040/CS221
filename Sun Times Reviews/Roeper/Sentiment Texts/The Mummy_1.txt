You killed your father  his wife  their child!

Tom Cruises Nick Morton, to Sofia Boutellas recently resurrected evil mummy princess.

They were different times.
  Neutral
The incredibly lame explanation from the recently resurrected evil mummy princess.

After all these decades, we still have Mummy issues.
  Negative
The  edition of The Mummy starring Boris Karloff was an early horror classic, and there have been some reasonably entertaining semi-camp film takes on the Mummy story over the years, but come on: Youre going to tell me you dug the Brendan Fraser reboots, or the prequel starring Dwayne The Rock Johnson?
  Negative
Lets be real.
  Positive
The Mummy, whatever form he or she might have taken, has never been as cool or as complex or as chilling as Dracula or the Wolf Man or Frankensteins creations.
  Negative
That said, given the A-list cast and the fact this is the first installment in Universals ambitious and far-reaching Dark Universe film series, its astonishing The Mummy is so wall-to-wall awful, so cheesy, so ridiculous, so convoluted, so uninvolving and so, so stupid.
  Negative
This movie keeps inviting you to not like it.
  Positive
It does everything in its power to turn you away.
  Positive
Russell Crowe is an Academy Award winner.
  Positive
Tom Cruise has had arguably the longest run in movie history as a successful action star.
  Positive
These guys know what theyre doing.
  Neutral
Yet when these two big-screen champions face off in an epic battle deep into this movie, the sequence is so poorly edited, the acting is so bad and the purpose of the scene is so insanely muddled, it feels as if Crowe and Cruise are doing it as some kind of cinematic community service sentence.
  Negative
Surely they must have known they were sinking in a quagmire of crap.
  Negative
After the obligatory overwrought prelude in ancient times where we learn the backstory of Boutellas power-hungry Ahmanet and what led to her being mummified, we cut to present-day Iraq, where soldier of fortune Nick Morton Cruise and his faithful comedic sidekick Chris Jake Johnson stumble upon ruins buried deep in the desert.
  Very negative
Annabelle Wallis is the archaeologist Jenny Halsey, who expresses her regret about a tryst with Nick even as she takes command of the site and oversees the air transfer of the ancient sarcophagi and other relics to London.
  Negative
Many weird and grotesque and inexplicable things happen on that journey.
  Negative
In fact, some of the events that transpire are so bizarre we spend the rest of the movie searching in vain for one character that isnt seriously ghastly andor creepy.
  Negative
Im going to issue a SPOILER ALERT here about Crowes character, even though hes listed as Dr. Henry Jekyll on IMDB.
  Negative
Suffice to say once the story returns to London, Dr. Jekyll has some very specific and idiotic plans for the re-animated and shackled Ahmanet, who has plans of her own for Nick, who literally cant get Ahmanet out of his mind.
  Negative
With each succeeding scene, The Mummy gets dumber and dumber, to the point where the filmmakers are practically inviting you to walk out of the theater.
  Negative
Its a zombie movie.
  Neutral
Then its not.
  Neutral
Its a possession movie.
  Neutral
Then its not.
  Neutral
Its a story of greed and corruption.
  Neutral
Then its not.
  Neutral
Its a big-time action movie, with terribly constructed CGI sequences of Nick and Jenny racing through the streets of London, just ahead of mass carnage.
  Very negative
Then its not.
  Neutral
This movie has no heart.
  Negative
This movie has no soul.
  Negative
The only thing worse about this film as a stand-alone story is the attempt to launch a franchise.
  Negative
Sometimes it takes a monster to bring down a monster, were told.
  Negative
And sometimes it takes a disaster of this magnitude to leave us hoping a studio will take a long hard look at the universe theyre about to expand.
