My favorite scene in the decidedly mediocre Fantastic Four comes late in the game, when Reed Richards, Johnny Storm, Sue Storm and The Thing meet with government and military officials in a conference room.
  Negative
Theyve got croissants in a basket, and coffee in fancy white china cups.
  Neutral
Whats that about?
  Neutral
Are they mocking The Thing because theres no way hed be able to put his rocky pinky through the cup handle?
  Negative
Do they really expect Johnny Storm to load up on the pastries before he gets his flame on?
  Negative
Maybe the goodies are just for the normal humans.
  Neutral
This is the kind of stuff one thinks about when wading through a lightweight and basically unnecessary attempt to once again bring some cinematic life to one of the lesser teams in the Marvel Universe.
  Neutral
Lets face it, theyre a bunch of mostly humorless brainiacs before their origins story kicks in  and then theyre transformed into mutants with superpowers not nearly as interesting or complex or inherently dramatic as the gifts-slash-curses of a Superman or a Spidey or a Hulk.
  Negative
Director Josh Trank Chronicle and his co-writers Jeremy Slater and Simon Kinberg start off promisingly enough with an extended prelude featuring a young Reed Richards Owen Judge teaming up with his classmate Ben Grimm Even Hanneman to build an inter-dimensional teleportation device that will transfer matter and perhaps even living beings to another locale.
  Negative
For the first  minutes or so, Fantastic Four has the vibe of one of those s or s sci-fi movies that depended heavily on character and plot in part because the special effects were good but not great.
  Negative
Flash forward seven years.
  Neutral
Reed now played by Miles Teller is still trying to transport model cars and airplanes to another place and maybe another time, and his work has captured the attention of one Dr. Franklin Storm Reg E. Cathey, who offers Reed a full scholarship to the Baxter Institute, an enormous think tank and research lab populated by lots of busy extras in lab coats who point at things or hunch over computers.
  Negative
Things move at a glacial pace as we meet Storms adopted daughter Sue Kate Mara, who has a bit of an attitude' Storms son Johnny Michael B. Jordan, who has a bit of an attitude, and Victor Von Doom Toby Kebbell, who has even MORE of an attitude, perhaps because his name is Victor Von Doom so hes probably got a pretty good handle on where his origins story is going.
  Negative
Were past the halfway point of the movie before we finally get to the moment where an ill-fated teleportation excursion transforms Ben Grimm into the Thing' Sue Storm into the Invisible Woman' Johnny into the Human Torch' and Reed into Mister Fantastic.
  Negative
The Thing is the Hulk with a skin problem.
  Neutral
Sue Storm can make herself invisible, and she can fly around in a bubble like Glinda the Good Witch from The Wizard of Oz.
  Negative
Johnny says Flame On, and hes a flying ball of fire.
  Negative
Most ridiculous of all, Mister Fantastic I dont they ever get around to calling him that in the movie, who sounds like a household-cleaning product, has the ability to stretch his limbs and then snap them back like a lizards tongue.
  Very negative
The likes of Iron Man and Professor X would get quite the chuckle out of these goofballs.
  Negative
Miles Teller has been on a career roll and he has a few choice moments in his far-too-brief flirtations with the equally excellent Mara.
  Positive
Michael B. Jordan's character is kind of a surly dope, both before and after his transformation.
  Positive
Once Jamie Bell's Ben Grimm is transformed into The Thing, it's just a voice-over performance.
  Positive
Nearly all of the action in Fantastic Four takes place in secret research labs, remote government labs or on the dark and gloomy planet Dr. Doom calls home.
  Negative
Theres virtually no connection to the real world  not a single moment where a rooftop garden party is livened up by a visit from the Human Torch, or the Invisible Woman has some fun with her abilities to disappear, or the Thing rumbles down a crowded city street, or Mister Fantastic puts his arm around a gal while shes in the living room and hes making dinner in the kitchen.
  Negative
It doesnt help when the dialogue includes such gems as:
You don't have to do this, Victor.
  Negative
Victor, you dont have to do this.
  Negative
We need to stop Victor!
  Negative
Lets get the hell out of here!
  Negative
I saw a different future for us, Sue.
  Positive
Croissants!
  Neutral
What the?
  Neutral
You know what that does to the digestive system of a man made of rocks?
  Neutral
All right, so that last line doesnt actually appear in the movie.
  Positive
Too bad.
  Neutral
