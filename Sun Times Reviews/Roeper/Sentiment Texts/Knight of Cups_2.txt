With the pretentious voice-overs about THE MEANING OF IT ALL and the endless shots of beautiful people gazing at the horizon and splashing in the ocean, Knight of Cups plays like a nearly two-hour parody of a Terrence Malick film, as directed by Terrence Malick.
  Negative
From Badlands to Days of Heaven to The Thin Red Line to Tree of Life, the enigmatic Malick has gifted us with beautiful, haunting, elegiac work  but at times his movies are so ethereal and abstruse, its as if hes daring the audience to exit the theater or punch in another channel on the remote.
  Positive
Such is the case with Knight of Cups, which is all about a handsome, successful Hollywood screenwriter who wears Armani clothes, drives a vintage Lincoln Continental convertible and beds a succession of the worlds most desirable women while pondering whether to accept an offer that will make him filthy rich  which sounds like a pretty sweet deal, yet this guy spends most of his waking hours in a state of restless funk, seemingly incapable of embracing and fully immersing himself in the gift of a great life.
  Positive
In the immortal words of the comedian Artie Lange: Waaaaaaaaah.
  Positive
Malick frames his story in a series of chapters introduced with tarot cards.
  Negative
In full-on brooding, self-absorbed, inaccessible Method acting mode, Christian Bale plays Rick, the aforementioned wandering soul of a screenwriter.
  Negative
The upright Knight of Cups tarot card represents an artistically inclined dreamer whos often restless' when reversed, the Knight of Cups card is indicative of a reckless, unreliable spirit who has trouble distinguishing between fact and fiction.
  Negative
In a voice-over, we hear of a young knight who forgot he was the son of a king and fell into a deep sleep.
  Negative
Rick wanders around Los Angeles in something of a haze, occasionally springing to life in non-linear episodes involving intense but brief romances with a stripper Teresa Palmer, a married woman Natalie Portman, a model Freida Pinto and his ex-wife Cate Blanchett back in the days before the marriage went sour.
  Negative
Thats just a partial list.
  Negative
Blanchett plays a doctor who specializes in treating the disfigured and the horribly injured.
  Negative
Yet her character is hardly distinguishable from the model or the stripper or the married woman.
  Negative
Theyre all just gorgeous reflections, bathing in Ricks sunlight when hes charming and shivering in his cold shadow when he grows bored with them and is ready to move on.
  Negative
Nearly every woman Rick encounters winds up soaking wet.
  Neutral
They jump in swimming pools fully clothed and not so fully clothed, they splash about in the ocean, they twirl and swirl like newly baptized nymphets that exist only to serve Ricks carnal desires.
  Negative
Antonio Banderas plays Tonio, a Hefner-esque hedonist who hosts a huge and wild party at his palatial estate.
  Negative
We catch glimpses of familiar actors such as Ryan ONeal at the party, presumably playing themselves.
  Negative
Wes Bentley shows up as Ricks brother, Barry, a minister and recovering drug addict who seems in no way equipped to be helping anyone out.
  Negative
Theres talk of a third brother, now dead.
  Neutral
One begins to wonder if hes the lucky one, as Rick and Barry are miserable human beings solo and misery squared together.
  Negative
Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, who has won three consecutive Oscars for Gravity, Birdman and The Revenant shoots Los Angeles through filters and angles and camera moves that give new perspective on even the most familiar L.A. streets and landmarks.
  Negative
Theres never a moment when Knight of Cups isnt something to behold, visually.
  Positive
Problem is, whether we take the story literally or as a grand metaphor, brimming with excerpts from 'The Pilgrims Progress' and Plato, biblical allusions and Symbolic Characters, Knight of Cups is a ponderous affair, never taking  seconds to make a point when four minutes is available.
  Negative
