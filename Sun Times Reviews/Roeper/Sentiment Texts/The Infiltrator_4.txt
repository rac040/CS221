Had they ever occupied the same universe, Walter White might have met his match in Robert Mazur.
  Negative
And Im thinking Bryan Cranston cant be overmatched by any role that comes his way.
  Negative
How versatile and smooth and sublime is Cranston that we bought every inch of his performance as the high school chemistry teacher turned meth kingpin on Breaking Bad  and hes just as convincing as a federal government agent who burrows deep undercover and gains the trust of the highest echelons of the Medellin cartel in The Infiltrator.
  Negative
Hes really good at playing bad, and a complete marvel at playing a good guy.
  Positive
What with Cranstons groundbreaking work on the aforementioned television series, his stage and HBO portrayals of LBJ, his Oscar-nominated turn in Trumbo, nifty stuff in The Lincoln Lawyer and Godzilla and even Get a Job, and now his breathtakingly fine performance in this film, has any other actor produced such an impressive body of work over the last seven or eight years?
  Positive
Based on the non-fiction book of the same name by U.S. Customs Special Agent Robert Mazur, The Infiltrator is a fictionalized telling of Operation C-Chase, a massive undercover effort in the mid-s that to this day is considered one of the most successful drug-busting operations in the history of the United States.
  Positive
Cranstons Bob Mazur is a Florida-based veteran Customs agent with the classic undercover thriller conundrum, aka Donnie Brasco Syndrome.
  Positive
At home, Bobs a solid family man with a lovely and devoted wife Juliet Aubrey, and two great kids Lara Decaro and Niall Hayes.
  Positive
Theyre corny and wonderful.
  Positive
Heck, they play board games at night.
  Neutral
But on the job, Bob is deep, deep, deep undercover as Bob Musella, a flashy, Mob-connected money launderer with an opulent lifestyle, a beautiful fiance Diane Krugers Kathy Ertz is actually a federal agent as well and enough clout to filter tens of millions of dollars in drug money.
  Positive
John Leguizamo gives one of the finest performances of his career as undercover agent Emir Abreu, a colorful and unpredictable character who is paired up with Bob against Bobs better judgment.
  Positive
But its Emir who has the connections to the connections to the connections, and its Emir who has Bobs back when things get ugly.
  Negative
At times The Infiltrator fills the screen with so many players on both sides of the law I could have used a scorecard to suss out everyones place on the pyramid.
  Negative
And there are moments when the intricacies of the money laundering process verge on the tedious.
  Negative
Small matters.
  Neutral
Director Brad Furman, working with a script written by his mother, thats right his mother, Ellen Brown Furman, is a gifted stylist who delivers consistently arresting visuals, accompanied by poprock tunes everything from Tom Sawyer by Rush to I Cant Wait by Nu Shooz to Eminence Front by the Who possibly inspired by the Martin Scorsese playbook.
  Positive
The Infiltrator is a great-looking, well-paced, wickedly funny and seriously tense thriller, bolstered by an ensemble cast as good as Ive seen in any film this year.
  Very positive
Joe Gilgun AMCs The Preacher, an amazing chameleon of an actor, is remarkable as Dominic, an apparent psychopath who Bob springs from prison to watch Bobs back.
  Very positive
Dominics descriptions of what the Cartel will do to Bob and his family if they learn his true identity are beyond chilling.
  Positive
Michael Pare  you got it, Eddie from Eddie and the Cruisers as a great five-minute cameo.
  Positive
Benjamin Bratt shines as Roberto Alcaino, one of Pablo Escobars most trusted distributors.
  Positive
Amy Ryan dons her patented no-nonsense persona as Bobs supervisor.
  Neutral
The hits just keep on coming  but front and center we have Cranston, sporting midnight-black hair and a ridiculous s mustache, but always commanding the screen, whether its in a quiet moment with his children, a shocking encounter that leaves him covered with blood, or a night on the town with his wife in which he has to segue from Bob the married guy to Bob the ruthless kingpin when one of Escobars associates happens upon them in a restaurant.
  Negative
Like every other based on a true story movie, The Infiltrator engages in cinematic shorthand and manufactures events that never happened  but the vast majority of the main characters have real-life counterparts, and many of the scenes depicted in the film played out in real life.
  Positive
Mazurs story and his book is so compelling it was almost inevitable wed see a movie one day  and the movie we got is one of the best of the year.
  Very positive
