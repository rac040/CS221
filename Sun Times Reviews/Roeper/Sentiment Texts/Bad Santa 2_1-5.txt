Ho Ho No.

If you were thinking of checking out Bad Santa  in a movie week where some truly wonderful films are arriving in theaters, this is me, standing at the ticket counter, pointing you to just about anything else available on the marquee.
  Negative
This has been the year of the long-time-coming sequel.
  Negative
Along with the reboots Ghostbusters and the superhero origin stories Deadpool and the CGI-fied versions of oft-told oldies The Legend of Tarzan, Ben-Hur and the continuation of franchise thrillers Jack Reacher: Never Go Back and the more traditional sequels released shortly after the first chapter Ride Along , the Great Reservoir of Creativity that is mainstream Hollywood in  has been all about sequels picking up storylines , ,  years after the original hit.
  Negative
My Big Fat Greek Wedding , Barbershop: The Next Cut, Zoolander , Finding Dory, Independence Day: Resurgence, Bridget Jones Baby, Titanic: Back in the Water.
  Positive
OKfine, there was no Titanic: Back in the Water, but there is a Bad Santa , arriving in theaters some  years after the fantastic, brutally offensive holiday comedy starring Billy Bob Thornton as the alcoholic, sex-addicted, misanthropic department store Santa Clausprofessional thief Willie T. Soke.
  Very negative
As directed by the black comedy artiste Terry Zwigoff Crumb, Ghost World and with terrific performances by Thornton, Tony Cox, Lauren Graham and two greatly missed comedic presences, John Ritter and Bernie Mac, Bad Santa was a critically acclaimed, medium-size box-office hit.
  Negative
Over the years it has attained something of a cult classic status.
  Positive
Mostly, its funny as hell.
  Negative
Now comes Bad Santa , a lazy, crummy-looking, poorly paced, why-bother follow-up that lacks the Christmas bells to go full-out politically incorrect.
  Negative
If youre going to bring back the most offensive Claus this side of Silent Night, Deadly Night, and youre going to get Academy Award winner Kathy Bates to play his morally bankrupt mother, you gotta give us more than Billy Bob half-heartedly reprising his booze-soaked, self-pitying jerk, and Bates downing shots, sporting myriad tattoos and cracking tasteless and stunningly unfunny jokes about her sexual organs and what a little perv her son was back in the day.
  Very negative
Not to mention the classy Christina Hendricks Mad Men in an embarrassing role as a recovering drug and sex addict who drags Willie into an alley and then onto a Christmas tree lot for self-hating sexual encounters.
  Negative
The bulk of Bad Santa  is set in Chicago, which is clearly not Chicago based on the architecture and the glimpses of store and transit signs in the background.
  Negative
Other than the obligatory establishing shots of the skyline, the Water Tower, the Bean, etc., Quebec stands in for Chicago.
  Negative
Tony Coxs Marcus Willies partner, the little person who double-crossed him in the original  is out of prison, asking for forgiveness and keen on re-teaming with Willie for a surefire caper worth  million.
  Positive
Theyll infiltrate a Chicago childrens charity as volunteers, and rob the safe on Christmas Eve, during the big pageant when nobodys paying attention.
  Negative
Right.
  Neutral
Because Christmas charities definitely keep all the cash in the safe all the way through Christmas.
  Positive
Willies con artist and thief of a mother, Sunny Bates, is already working for the charity as a Mrs. Claus.
  Negative
When Willie lays eyes on his mother for the first time in  years, he punches her in the face  and she mocks him by saying he still hits like his father.
  Neutral
This is first of about two dozen times when Bad Santa  goes for shocking humor, which just sits there like a bad fruitcake nobody wants to even look at.
  Negative
Brett Kelly produces a few laughs as the curly-haired, heavy-set, exceedingly simple-minded Thurman Merman, now  but just as nave as ever, and just as devoted to Willie, to the point where he takes a bus to Chicago and wanders around the snowy streets in shorts and T-shirt, asking strangers, Do you know Willie?
  Negative
Ryan Hansen is the bland, poorly sketched villain  the rich and corrupt Regent Hastings, who runs the charity but skims  percent of the profits for himself, or so were told.
  Negative
Hendricks is his wife, Diane, who has a good heart but seems incredibly dim, and did we mention shes so self-destructive she yanks the pathetic Willie into alleys and other outdoor venues for demeaning sexual encounters in which she encourages him to insult her?
  Negative
No doubt some critics will slam Bad Santa  as a lump of coal in our holiday movie stockings.
  Negative
To which I would say: why be so rough on lumps of coal?
