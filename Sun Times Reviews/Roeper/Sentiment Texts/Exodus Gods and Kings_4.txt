Director Ridley Scotts borderline-lunatic, bold, gargantuan and visually stunning epic Exodus: Gods and Kings is one of the most unforgettable movies of the year, and I never want to see it again.
  Very positive
I can explain.
  Neutral
Some movies, while superior works, just dont have that high repeatability factor.
  Negative
Who wants to see Cries and Whispers or Sophies Choice or Saving Private Ryan or Schindlers List multiple times?
  Neutral
I know that sentiment would have some film scholars reeling, but you know what I mean.
  Negative
You can watch your favorite comedy  or even dramas such as The Godfather or Goodfellas or The Shawshank Redemption  a dozen times.
  Negative
Not so much with Requiem For a Dream.
  Neutral
Exodus: Gods and Kings is not a movie you want to see twice, unless youre a glutton for watching punishment.
  Negative
Ridley Scott does for Moses what Darren Aronofsky did for Noah  and then triples the stakes.
  Negative
This is a  million action movie, in some ways more reminiscent of Scotts Gladiator than Cecil B. DeMilles  VistaVision classic The Ten Commandments.
  Negative
Weve got Christian Bale as an intense, sword-wielding, tormented Moses' John Turturro as the pharaoh Seti, and Sigourney Weaver as Tuya, who raised Moses like a son' Joel Edgerton as Ramses, who succeeded Seti, exiled Moses and eventually became Moses blood enemy, and Aaron Paul from Breaking Bad as Joshua, the Robin to Moses Batman.

We also get hundreds of thousands of expertly computer-generated Hebrew slaves' astonishing scenes of the Plagues of Egypt, from diseased livestock to locusts to boils to frogs to brutal thunderstorms to the death of every firstborn son' bloody battles in which Moses wields his special sword as if its a legacy weapon worthy of a Marvel Universe character 
And have I mentioned that instead of portraying God as a a voice emanating from behind a fire, Scott has physicalized the deity as a boy who speaks with a British accent and is almost always in a bad mood?
  Negative
As was the case with Noah and is the case with any attempt to interpret the Old Testament or for that matter the life and times of Jesus Christ, a filmmaker is taking a great risk.
  Positive
When you make literal these beautiful, sparse, sometimes frightening, sometimes awe-inspiring written passages, youre putting modern-day visuals on some of the greatest stories ever told  and youre putting your stamp on something billions hold sacred.
  Positive
Exodus: Gods and Kings opens with Bales Moses and Edgertons Ramses as grown men, as close as brothers can be without sharing the same bloodline.
  Negative
Even as they have each others backs in battle, we already see shades of Ramses narcissism nice eyeliner and his resentment of Moses, who is a superior war general and is clearly Setis favorite.
  Negative
Once Seti is out of the picture, Ramses pounces on the rumor which of course turns out to be true that Moses is in fact Hebrew.
  Negative
He doesnt have the heart to kill Moses, so he banishes him from the kingdom, fully believing Moses will soon be dead.
  Negative
Hardly a spoiler alert to say thats not exactly how things play out.
  Negative
Filmed on location in the Canary Islands, in Spain and at the legendary Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, England, Exodus: Gods and Kings never misses an opportunity for a sweeping overhead shot in which Dariusz Wolskis camera flies over Setis kingdom, the battle for Kadesh and Ramses furiously pursuing Moses against the backdrop of the parting of the Red Sea.
  Negative
Its thrilling filmmaking.
  Positive
Not to mention all those plagues, which we see illustrated in excruciatingly vivid fashion.
  Neutral
Its amazing stuff.
  Positive
You know its impossible to wrangle , frogs for a plague scene, or create an actual -foot wave, or hire ,-plus extras, but the special effects are so good its difficult to imagine the scenes having any more resonance even if such feats were attainable.
  Negative
Bales Moses is equal parts family man, reluctant hero, visionary, warrior and prophet.
  Negative
He humanizes one of the most iconic figures of all time.
  Positive
Here is a man who grew up believing he was an Egyptian, who came to embrace his true destiny and who found himself taking dictation from a burning bush or in Ridley Scotts eyes, God as a kid.
  Negative
Weeks before reaching theaters, Exodus: Gods and Kings was maybe the most controversial movie of the year.
  Very negative
Bale said he thinks Moses was likely schizophrenic and was one of the most barbaric individuals that I have ever read about in my life.
  Negative
Scott has been criticized for casting white actors in the leads, while non-whites portray slaves and servants.
  Neutral
His explanation  essentially, youre not going to get a  million movie made without casting recognizable actors  hardly doused the flames, even though its the tough-to-swallow truth.
  Negative
And then theres the matter of an -year-old British actor playing Moses vision of God.
  Negative
Whether you believe Moses is a fairy tale character or he walked the same Earth we inhabit today, yes, its pretty likely he didnt look and sound like the Dark Knight in sandals.
  Negative
Since the dawn of movies, there have been legit concerns about ethnicity and casting.
  Negative
I hear the voices of protest about this film, and I understand their concerns.
  Positive
But as a fictional, big-budget, -D, epic interpretation of Moses journey, Exodus: Gods and Kings is spectacular.
  Positive
