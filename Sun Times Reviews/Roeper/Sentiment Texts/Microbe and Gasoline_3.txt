The French filmmaker Michel Gondry will always be a cinematic hero to me for giving us the waking-dream masterpiece Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, as well as lesser but still fascinating works such as Be Kind Rewind.
  Very positive
The Green Hornet, not so much.
  Negative
Now comes Microbe and Gasoline, said to be very loosely based on Gondrys childhood memories.
  Neutral
Its a quirky and unique coming-of-age story about two -year-old outcasts who form a lasting bond while hitting the road in a motorized shack of their own making.
  Positive
Because of course.
  Neutral
Ange Dargent gives a natural, low-key performance as the likable and eccentric Daniel, who is so small and underdeveloped for his age, one teacher mistakes him for a girl and his unwanted nickname is Microbe.
  Positive
Theophile Baquet is equally effective as the new kid in school  the outwardly confident, attention-seeking Theo, aka Gasoline.
  Positive
At outset of summer vacation, the boys take an old lawnmower motor, bring it back to life, build a tiny house of sorts atop a frame  and they hit the road.
  Positive
One nifty touch: When the vehicle is parked, the boys can flip a handle that disguises the wheels and makes the thing look like a dilapidated little shed, the better for the police to ignore.
  Positive
One of the boys isnt being honest with the other about their final destination, but as with road movies of just about every shape and size, its not about the end game, its about the journey.
  Positive
Along the way, Microbe and Gasoline have all sorts of adventures, from the comedic to the harrowing.
  Negative
Theyre in way over their heads in a Korean massage parlor.
  Negative
They have a bizarre encounter with a middle-aged couple of empty-nesters who are into the pop singer Shakira.
  Neutral
A stolen football leads to a crazy chase scene and a hilarious peace treaty.
  Positive
Microbe and Gasoline is set in present day, but Gondry is clearly drawing upon his own youth.
  Positive
The boys dress and hairstyles are out of the s, they prefer paper maps to GPS and Daniels passion is drawing, as in old-fashioned drawing with colored pencils on paper.
  Positive
An almost unrecognizable Audrey Tautou Amelie plays Daniels laid-back mother, who encourages his artistry but sometimes seems oblivious to his world.
  Negative
Dargent and Baquet look and sound like actual -year-old boys and not -year-old actors playing -year-old boys.
  Negative
Thats probably because they WERE young teenagers when the movie was made, and neither had a ton of professional acting experience  so their work seems natural.
  Negative
This is Gondrys most straightforward film to date, but even his most mainstream work is a little out there and at times can be a tad self-conscious or even off-putting.
  Neutral
That happens more than once with Microbe and Gasoline.
  Positive
Mostly, though, we appreciate the unique personalities of these two kids, and were glad they found each other.
  Positive
It gives them a fighting chance to get through high school.
  Positive
