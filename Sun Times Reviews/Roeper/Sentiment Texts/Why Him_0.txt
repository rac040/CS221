Trusty moviegoers: Please allow me to SPOILER ALERT just one scene from the multi-vehicle car wreck that is Why Him?
  Negative
so you can see where Im coming from when I tell you this is in the bottom percent of movies Ive ever seen.
  Negative
Ready?
  Neutral
Bryan Cranstons Ned Fleming is skulking about the home office of James Francos Laird Mayhew, an obnoxious Silicon Valley multi-millionaire romancing his precious daughter Stephanie Zoey Deutch, who has dropped out of Stanford in order to live with this lout.
  Negative
Ned is video chatting with KevinDingle dont you just love these wacky character names?
  Negative
, an employee of Neds back home in Michigan.
  Negative
Theyre trying to hack Lairds computer so Ned can dig up some dirt on Laird and persuade his daughter to break it off with Laird.
  Negative
When Ned hears Laird and Stephanie approaching the office, he hides under the desk  and he stays there, making horrified faces, as Laird and Stephanie make love.
  Negative
Thats right.
  Neutral
Rather than stand up and announce himself and make some sort of excuse for why hes in the room, Ned chooses to stay hidden while his daughter and her crass boyfriend have sex just above him.
  Negative
Ha.
  Neutral
Ha.
  Neutral
Ha.
  Neutral
When I tell you thats not even the most noxious scene in Why Him?
  Neutral
,' please believe me.
  Positive
Please spend your hard-earned movie-attending dough on just about anything else playing at the multiplex.
  Negative
For crying out loud, even Bad Santa  and Office Christmas Party are better, or at least not as rank, as this stinker.
  Very negative
The premise of Why Him?
  Negative
is SO tired.
  Negative
How many movies and sitcoms have we seen about the father who thinks his daughters boyfriendhusbandfiancwhatever isnt good enough for her?
  Neutral
In this case, dads horror is justified.
  Negative
The guy romancing his daughter is a nightmare.
  Negative
Yes, hes an obscenely famous and wealthy video-game inventor  but hes also a manic, infantile, grotesquely inappropriate, aggressively needy and self-absorbed creep.
  Negative
We share dads loathing for the boyfriend, but we also have a really, really difficult time empathizing with the supposedly super-smart and grounded and wonderful daughter who is in love with this clown.
  Negative
Ned is an old-fashioned family guy whoruns an old-fashioned printing company in Grand Rapids.
  Positive
He and his wife Barb Megan Mullally have two wonderful children: the aforementioned Stephanie and her younger, weirdly formal brother Scotty Griffin Gluck.
  Positive
Stephanie invites the family out to California to spend Christmas without telling them she has dropped out of Stanford and shes living with a wealthy techie in his s.
Good move, Stephanie.
  Negative
Lairds mansion is festooned with hideous art, e.g., a dead moose floating in a tank of its own urine.
  Negative
Can you guess what will happen with that tank down the road?
  Negative
He has a full-time spiritual advisor named Gustav Keegan Michael-Key, who seems aware and resigned to the fact hes counseling a developmentally stunted person.
  Negative
Laird gets a giant tattoo of the Fleming family on his back, makes sexually suggestive remarks to Stephanies mother, describes having sex with Stephanie in graphic detail at a family dinner, gives wildly inappropriate advice to young Scotty and builds a bowling alley featuring Neds likeness on the wall in order to win over Ned.
  Negative
Not funny, not funny, not funny, not funny, not funny.
  Very negative
And in one of the most egregious cases in recent years of crowbarring a bit into a movie, were told Ned was a big fan of Kiss back in the day  which leads to a monumentally unfunny and oh-so-predictable payoff later in the story.
  Negative
Years ago, the great Roger Ebert told me it takes people with real talent to make the most unforgettably terrible movies.
  Positive
Hack directors and wooden actors will deliver consistently mediocre fare, but the most spectacular misfires are often the result of gifted people taking a shot at something different  and crashing and burning in legendary fashion.
  Positive
Think of Lucasfilms production of Howard the Duck.
  Positive
Spielbergs .
  Neutral
Beatty and Hoffman and Elaine May with Ishtar.
  Negative
Michael The Deer Hunter Cimino and Heavens Gate.
  Neutral
Rob Reiner, director of A Few Good Men and The Princess Bride and Misery, giving us North, which inspired Rogers immortal passage: I hated this movie.
  Negative
Hated hated hated hated hated this movie.
  Very negative
Hated it.
  Neutral
Granted, Why Him?
  Negative
director John Hamburg isnt Steven Spielberg or Rob Reiner, but hes written some big hits Meet the Parents, Zoolander and he knows comedy.
  Positive
Jonah Hill has a story credit on the film.
  Positive
Cranston and Franco are two of the most gifted and versatile actors on the planet.
  Positive
Supporting players from Mullaly to Keegan-Michael Key to Cedric the Entertainer try their best.
  Negative
Thats a whole lot of talent contributing to a black hole of a comedy.
  Neutral
