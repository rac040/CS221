As simple and as complicated as that.

With his trusted attorney Andrew Walsh Albert Brooks in one of those smallish dramatic roles where hes so good you cant imagine anyone else playing the role by his side, Abel cuts a deal for an expansive waterfront shipping terminal that will give him a decided advantage on the very rivals who are already sending out hooligans to beat the holy heck out of his drivers and steal his trucks.

Its a move equal part ambitious and suicidal, especially since Abel knows hes in the crosshairs of a power-hungry district attorney a stellar David Oyelowo, who plays Martin Luther King in Selma.
  Positive
Abel is swimming with sharks  including his own wife, Anna Jessica Chastain, whos a femme fatale straight out of a s movie, what with her perfect coif, her fang-like nails, her cleavage-baring outfits and her calculating moves.

Chandor the writer comes across as a big fan of David Mamets, and Chandor the director invokes stylistic touches reminiscent of Sidney Lumet, among others, but Chandor is no cover artist.
  Positive
Whether hes framing the ideal establishing shot before segueing into tense, shadow-filled, interior confrontations, or staging an elaborate chase scene on the th Street Bridge, Chandor is a filmmaker with a deep palette.

This is just his third film.
