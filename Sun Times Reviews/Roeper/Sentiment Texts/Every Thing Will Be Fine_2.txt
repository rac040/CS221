  Negative
After Kate hands him a book she wants him to read, Thomas starts walking down the long, long pathway leading away from Kates house.
  Negative
He walks and we follow, he walks and we follow  and its just as tedious as you might imagine.
  Negative
Sorry about dragging you through aPointless Cinematic Moment of Boredom, but that scene is indicative of the strange, detached, off-kilter nature of Wim Wenders Every Thing Will be Fine.
  Negative
Its a well-photographed story with an intriguing setup, but soon were mired in a meandering, stilted story with forced dialogue and some surprisingly subpar performances from the talented cast.
  Negative
Lets start with Franco, who is capable of providing terrific laughs in films such as The Interview and This Is the End, and resonant dramatic work in movies such as True Story and  Hours.
  Positive

  Neutral
His already rocky relationship with his partner Sara Rachel McAdams bursts apart at the seams.
  Neutral
He wallows in grief and self-pity, at one point carrying out a half-hearted suicide attempt that is filmed with such overwrought style, it almost seems like a comedy bit.
  Very negative

Thomas continues to wrestle with his regrets and has great difficulty expressing any true emotion.
  Positive
We wonder why Ann would want to spend any time with this self-absorbed, closed-off man, whos never fully present in the moment.
  Negative
Cue the intrusive murder-mystery type music by the normally reliable Alexandre Desplat  even though this is in no way a murder-mystery  as Thomas past reaches out and lands on his doorstep one day.
  Negative
Other than the tense early scenes in the immediate aftermath of the accident, Every Thing Will be Fine remains curiously detached from its subject matter.
  Negative
Its a cold film.
  Negative
The story is set in Quebec.
  Neutral
McAdams is Canadian-born she grew up in London, Ontario, and it appears shes going for a distinctly Quebec French accent, but it seems to come and go.
  Negative
Shes also saddled with a character whose every line sounds scripted.
  Negative
When Sara reappears after disappearing from the movie for a long stretch, its in regrettable, soap opera-level fashion.
  Negative
Like just about everything else in Every Thing Will be Fine, it just doesnt quite jell.
