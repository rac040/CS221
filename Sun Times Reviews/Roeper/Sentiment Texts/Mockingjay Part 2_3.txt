If they had a Concussion Protocol in The Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen would be forced into early retirement.
  Negative
In just this installment, the fourth and last chapter in the wildly successful film series based on Suzanne Collins immensely popular novels, Katniss wakes up in a recovery room on three occasions.
  Positive
Seems like every other day, the good citizens of Panem are hearing Katniss is dead, while Katniss is regaining consciousness in a secret recovery room somewhere, tethered to an IV while some attendant or another tells her, I need you to lie back and relax.
  Negative
Youre going to be OK.
  Neutral
Is she?
  Neutral
Is she really?

Even if Katniss makes it to the Capitol, assassinates the slithery and evil President Snow the invaluable Donald Sutherland and helps restore freedom to the  Districts, is this poor girl ever going to smile again or get a good nights sleep?
  Negative
Mockingjay  Part  is a grim, dark, trippy, violent and sometimes just plain bizarre journey, which makes for a fitting if uneven conclusion to a film series thats always been weird.
  Very negative
So weird Id say the Twilight movies, which feature vampires and wolves and humans getting into all sorts of soap opera-y entanglements, might be less insane than the madness of The Hunger Games.
  Negative
The fourth movie in four years picks up where Mockingjay  Part  left off, with director Francis Lawrence helming his third straight entry, after Gary Ross directed the first rightfully assuming if youre not up to speed now, youre probably not going to buy a ticket for a stand-alone movie this late in the game.
  Very negative
Katniss Jennifer Lawrence and the dashing but dull Gale Liam Hemsworth, along with a half-dozen other survivors of previous Hunger Games, are regrouping and preparing to carry out the orders of President Alma Coin Julianne Moore, the leader of the peoples revolution, who has fantastically streaked hair and wears color-coordinated ensembles dig those blue leather high-heeled boots!
  Negative
that make her look like she must might have been the ruthless editor of a major fashion magazine before this whole post-apocalyptic dystopian thing overtook the continent.
  Negative
RELATED: Jennifer Lawrence loved growing up on 'Hunger Games' set
Peeta the bland Josh Hutcherson, who throughout the series has been the weakest bit of casting has been brainwashed to kill Katniss  but hes starting to regain glimpses of his past and his true loyalties.
  Negative
Oh great.
  Positive
Hell bore us again.
  Negative
Were treated to appearances  some far too brief  by a host of A-list talents from previous entries in the franchise, including Elizabeth Banks Effie Trinket, the District  escort with the ridiculous fashion but a heart of gold' Jeffrey Wrights tech guru, Beetee' Stanley Tuccis smarmy television host, Caesar Flickerman' Woody Harrelsons rebellious former Hunger Games winner, Haymitch Abernathy, and the late Philip Seymour Hoffmans Plutarch Heavensbee, the ultimate Gamemaker.
  Negative
Hoffman died during filming but had completed most of his role.
  Neutral
Seeing him again, one last time, is of course bittersweet.
  Positive
What a tremendous and unique talent.
  Very positive
Much of Mockingjay  Part  centers on Katniss and a small platoon of soldiers advancing on the Capitol  first as part of a propaganda mission, but eventually on the front lines.
  Negative
The blending of CGI and practical effects is impressive, but at times its difficult to discern just whos getting shot or beaten or otherwise taken out, especially during an extended sequence set in underground passageways.
  Positive
Largely gone are the glorious colors and the sometimes comically over-the-top pageantry of some of the previous films.
  Positive
This is primarily a war movie, with no guarantees all your favorite remaining characters are going to make it to the finish line.
  Negative
I love Sutherlands showcase moments, especially when he has gathered his cabinet around an enormous circular table and offers a celebratory toast that turns out to be anything but.
  Positive
Of the younger rebels, Natalie Dormers Cressida, with her half-shaved head and her intricate tattoos and her plucky spirit, is the coolest of the bunch.
  Positive
Dormers co-star from Game of Thrones, the fantastic Gwendoline Christie, has a tiny, unsatisfying part.
  Positive
I kept hoping shed return, but alas 
After a couple of lulls that do little more than pad the films overlong two-hour, -minute running time, the third act is packed with so much action and so many twists it all feels a bit rushed.
  Negative
But in those final scenes, Lawrence has a chance to shine and remind us she went from promising newcomer to bona fide movie star over these last four films, and Katniss once again finds herself in front of a throng of tens of thousands, hoping shell make the right life-and-death decision.
  Negative
Shes ever the reluctant hero, but her heart and her aim remain true.
  Neutral
