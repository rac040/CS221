Guess its my turn to take out the trash again.
  Negative
Central Intelligence is one of those slick, gunplay-riddled, stupidly plotted, aggressively loud buddy movies  so formulaic and dumb, even if you see it youll probably forget youve seen it by the end of the year.
  Very negative
And if thats the case, consider yourself fortunate.
  Negative
For about a half-dozen years now, Ive been writing reviews of Kevin Hart movies in which I mention how likable Hart is, and what a shame it is to see his talents squandered.
  Negative
Here we go again.
  Neutral
As was the case with the Ride Along movies and Get Hard, Hart is cast in the role of the likable everyman who is thrust into dangerous situations where he conveys great fear by cowering, trying to talk his way out of peril, running away from bad guys, dodging bullets, howling during chase sequences and accidentally getting the better of henchmen during quick-cut fight scenes.
  Negative
Oh, and theres the obligatory domestic subplot in which Harts character has to make things right with his beautiful but clueless significant other, who is always the last one to realize her mans life is in serious danger.
  Negative
Directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber with a screenplay from a team of three writers including Thurber, Central Intelligence alternates intermittently funny exchanges of dialogue with depressingly familiar action sequences featuring dozens of gunmen who are incredibly poor shots and car chases and fight sequences that seem to take place in towns and cities where there are no bystanders and theres no media coverage.
  Negative
Things explode in a vacuum.
  Neutral
Hart plays Calvin Joyner, who in  was the king of his high school: a top student, a superstar athlete, prom king, in love with the most beautiful girl, admired by all including the principal, who actually says at an awards ceremony if he were biologically capable of having a son, hed want it to be Calvin.
  Negative
The equally cringe-inducing response from Calvin: If his mom were into white guys, shed go for the principal.
  Positive
On the eve of Calvins th high school reunion, hes not feeling so hot about the way things turned out.
  Negative
Hes a mid-level forensic account on the slow track at work  hardly living up to his Golden Jet nickname from high school.
  Negative
Sure, hes married to his high school sweetheart, the lovely and successful Maggie Danielle Nicolet, but even her success makes him feel lousy about himself.
  Negative
Enter one Bob Stone Dwayne Johnson.
  Negative
Back in the day, Bob was a morbidly obese, unpopular kid who was the subject of a horribly cruel prank in front of the entire student body  but now hes a chiseled god involved in international intrigue as a spy, or maybe hes a spy gone rogue, but whatever hes doing its really badass and involves lots of serious people with serious weaponry wanting him dead.
  Negative
One kinda funny touch: Even though Bob is so chiseled he looks like a statue come to life, and hes capable of taking down four or five bad guys without breaking a sweat, hes still a major dork.
  Positive
He loves unicorns and dumb commercials from the s, he wears jorts and a fanny pack, and hes incapable of shielding his unabashed hero worship of The Jet, as he calls Calvin.
  Neutral
You cant help but laugh at Johnsons endearing performance, especially when he has flashbacks to high school traumas and hes utterly vulnerable, despite his hulking persona and his trained-killer skill set.
  Positive
The wonderful Amy Ryan is wasted in a clichd role as a CIA agent convinced Bob is the Black Badger, an international bad guy trying to gain access to secret codes that will compromise national security.
  Negative
It feels as if about a dozen characters from a dozen different recent movies are out there in pursuit of secret codes that will compromise national security.
  Negative
Aaron Paul has too little screen time as Bobs erstwhile partner, Phil.
  Negative
Far too many of the one-liners in Central Intelligence contain references to pop culture, from Taylor Swifts love life to Road House to Sixteen Candles to Jake Gyllenhaal to Denzel Washington to a thuddingly unfunny moment in which Hart is told he looks like a black Will Smith.
  Negative
You can practically see the screenwriters fingerprints on the dialogue.
  Neutral
We get cardboard bad guys who are homophobes, sexist pigs, bullies or some combination thereof.
  Negative
Just because theyre the villains doesnt excuse the low-level humor.
  Negative
Theres never a moment when intelligence is central to the alleged humor of this film.
  Negative
