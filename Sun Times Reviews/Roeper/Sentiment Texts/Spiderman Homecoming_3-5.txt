Couldnt you just be a friendly, neighborhood Spider-Man?
  Negative
Tony Stark, tempering expectations for -year-old Peter Parker.
  Negative
Spider-Man wants to save the world.
  Neutral
He wants to be an Avenger.
  Positive
He wants to soar with the likes of Iron Man and Captain America.
  Positive
Fortunately for us, the adventures in Spider-Man: Homecoming are indeed more of the friendly neighborhood variety.
  Negative
Three cheers for that.
  Neutral
Tell me youre not experiencing a few symptoms of Save the Universe Fatigue after a seemingly non-stop parade of huge-budget superhero movies in which various caped and costumed crusaders engage in epic, ultimate-stakes battles with various warped and evil villains  with the fate of EVERYONE FOR ALL TIME in the balance.
  Negative
century version of a John Hughes teen-angst romancecomedy meshed with a superhero saga.
  Positive
On the heels of the Spider-Man trilogy from the s starring Tobey Maguire and the reboot with Andrew Garfield a fine actor who looked too old for the part, this is yet another early-arc story about the bright and chipper but hardly streetwise Peter ParkerSpidey  although mercifully it isnt an origin story that goes all the way back to that radioactive spider biting young Petey, the tragic death of Uncle Ben, etc.
  Negative
Those pivotal but oh-so-familiar events have already happened when we pick up the story here.
  Neutral
Captain America: Civil War, and the potential Holland displayed in limited screen time in that film flourishes in Homecoming.
  Negative
Holland delivers a winning performance as the -year-old Peter, a high school sophomore from Queens juggling classwork, his work with the Academic Decathlon team and what he calls his internship with Stark Industries  not to mention keeping secrets from the loving but smothering Aunt May Marisa Tomei, and yes, the film makes a couple of references to Aunt May being quite the looker.
  Positive
Director Jon Watts and the team of screenwriters do a fine job of juggling parallel and then eventually intersecting storylines.
  Positive
Michael Keaton has already played a Batman and a Birdman, so why not the Vulture?
  Negative
The great Keaton has never been afraid to go big with a performance, but hes actually a bit muted here which makes it more interesting as a chip-on-his-shoulder criminal mastermind who purloined some leftover bits and pieces from Avengers headquarters and converted them into deadly weapons.
  Negative
Hes also fashioned a fantastic if somewhat clunky winged contraption that enables him to fly, which of course invites a few chuckles as we recall Keatons previous endeavors as a flying man.
  Negative
Meanwhile, Peter keeps pestering Tony Starks right-hand man Happy Jon Favreau for another assignment with the Avengers.
  Negative
Tony Stark himself shows up from time to time, either in person or via cutting-edge technology, to oversee Peters activities and to tell him to slow his roll.
  Negative
So Peter spends his days plotting adventures with his best friend Ned Jacob Batalon, funny and likable, pining over a smart and sweet senior student named Liz Laura Harrier and bungling his way through various efforts to thwart criminal activity in the neighborhood.
  Negative
A typical misadventure: Peter captures a guy trying to break into his own car.
  Negative
Spider-Man: Homecoming is breezy fun.
  Positive
Holland and Batalon are a hoot as classic high school friends  one a little bit nerdy but earnest and handsome and coming into his own, the other a full-on and cheerfully self-aware geek whose idea of great night is building a giant Lego Death Star.
  Positive
The budding romance between Peter and Liz rings true.
  Positive
Zendaya scores some laughs as a cynical rebel student.
  Positive
Donald Glover steals a scene as a small-time crook who sizes up Spidey and realizes hes dealing with a neophyte.
  Negative
A handful of familiar characters from the Marvel Universe pop in here and there.
  Positive
Only occasionally does Homecoming stumble.
  Neutral
A major late surprise defies credulity, even within this fantastical world.
  Positive
The same could be said of a major sequence in which Happy oversees the transportation of all sorts of invaluable Avengers assets.
  Neutral
The best thing about Spider-Man: Homecoming is Spidey is still more of a kid than a man.
  Positive
Even with his budding superpowers, he still has the impatience, the awkwardness, the passion, the uncertainty and sometimes the dangerous ambition of a teenager still trying to figure out this world.
  Negative
