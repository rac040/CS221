This is a tough sell.

The mindset of the warped and twisted has been the focal point of many a brilliant film through the years, but if youre going to make a movie about two -year-old girls who are put away for murdering an infant  only to be released seven years later and implicated in the disappearance of a toddler  that film should be something special.
  Positive
Otherwise, why delve into such subject matter?
  Negative
Every Secret Thing is a small, well-crafted film with a few chilling moments and some fine performances, but its a muddled, pedestrian crime thriller  and thats a particular disappointment because the producer is Frances McDormand' the screenplay is from the gifted Nicole Holofcener writer-director of Enough Said and Lovely amp' Amazing, and the director is Amy Berg, who has lensed the excellent crime documentaries West of Memphis and Deliver Us From Evil.
  Positive
Despite those credentials from the filmmakers and an excellent cast that includes Diane Lane, Elizabeth Banks, Nate Parker and Dakota Fanning, Every Secret Thing feels flat and unfocused.
  Negative
We have two timelines.

  Negative
Elizabeth Banks is a fine actress, but its a bit of miscasting here.
  Positive
She and her partner Nate Parker seem to be in over their heads and curiously lacking in focus and a sense of urgency about the case.
  Negative
Scenes where Nancy yells about paperwork on the phone, and her partner harangues a possible suspect, ring false and forced.
  Very negative
Banks modified mullet haircut, presumably meant to identify her character as someone whos beautiful but doesnt care a whit about appearance, is nothing but distracting.
