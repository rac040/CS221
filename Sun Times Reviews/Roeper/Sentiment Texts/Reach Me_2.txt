Of the many strange and altogether unbelievable characters in the bizarre and goofy Pulp Fiction knockoff that is Reach Me, the most amazing is Sylvester Stallones newspaper editor.
  Negative
Stallones Gerald wears a porkpie hat, dines at posh restaurants, wears expensive suits, drives a car that costs well into the six figures and paints abstract art in a giant studio.
  Negative
I think there might be just a hint of the real Sylvester Stallone in this character.
  Neutral
He is a man of great wealth and power, and he verbally abuses the one reporter we ever see him interacting with, telling in thunderous tones hes never going to write that novel or even graduate from gossip reporting to hard news.
  Positive
Its nuts is what it is.
  Neutral
This whole movie is crazy, with all sorts of well-known folks stumbling and bumbling about in search of a character.
  Negative
At times Reach Me is undeniably intriguing, mostly because its just so weird and disconnected.
  Positive
Eventually, though, it just becomes tiresome.
  Negative
Here we go.
  Neutral
Lots of story threads, and yes, nearly all of them interconnect in the big finale.
  Positive
Kyra Sedgwick is Colette, fresh out of a three-year stint in prison for setting fire to her house after learning her husband was having an affair.
  Positive
Elizabeth Henstridge is her niece, an actress whos British, and why not.
  Negative
Kelsey Grammer and Tom Sizemore are mobsters.
  Negative
Danny Aiello is a gruff priest with a drinking problem.
  Negative
Nelly is a hip-hop artist named E-Ruption.
  Neutral
Rebekah Chaney is a low-level criminals girlfriend.
  Negative
Her name is Denise-Denise.
  Neutral
Just like the old song!
  Negative
Too funny.
  Positive
Lauren Cohan from The Walking Dead is Kate, who used to have a stuttering problem and a cleft lip, but now has just the cleft lip.
  Negative
And then theres Thomas Jane as Wolfie, who has the haircut of a roadie for Spinal Tap and wears red pants ALL THE TIME.
  Negative
Not the best look for an undercover cop who cant get through most days without gunning down a few bad guys.
  Negative
Kevin Connolly from Entourage is Roger, a reporter tasked with unmaking the true identity of the mysterious Teddy, who has written a mega-selling self-help book but is ducking all interviews.
  Positive
Judging by the hackneyed, clichd advice dispensed in excerpts we hear from the book, theres no reason it should have been published, let alone become a bestseller.
  Negative
Many of the characters in our story have been deeply affected by the book' it has literally changed their lives.
  Negative
Colette the convict wants to make a difference.
  Positive
A dimwitted henchman no longer has an appetite for violence.
  Negative
E-Ruption, also fresh out of prison, goes on TV and sounds like a late-night pitchman, telling everyone if theyre not happy with their lives, its up to THEM to make some changes!
  Positive
At times it almost feels as if writer-director John Herzfeld is going for a parody of Crash, with all these interwoven stories taking place in and around Redondo Beach.
  Negative
But theres very little social commentary laced in with the bursts of violence and oddball romances.
  Negative
Most of these allegedly colorful characters are mere sketches, given an affectation or two to run with and left to meander in and out of the story.
  Negative
Although I have to say, that Stallone character is so bananas I kind of dug him.
  Negative
If this isnt the most insanely off-point portrayal of a newspaper editor in the history of cinema, Ill take your nominations.
