When Edgar Rice Burroughs published 'Tarzan of the Apes'in a pulp magazine in , even his active imagination probably couldnt have envisioned how many mostly mediocre and sometimes painfully awful versions of the vine-swinging, ululating, Jane-loving King of the Jungle would follow.
  Negative
From the silent features of the s and s through the kinda terrible Johnny Weissmuller B-movies of the s and s through the horrific Tarzan the Ape Man with Miles OKeeffe and Bo Derek in  through the ambitious and competent Greystoke in  through Disneys animated Tarzan in  not to mention all the stage plays and TV shows and radio serials, weve had tons of Tarzan adaptations  but not a single legitimately great movie.
  Negative
That streak remains intact.
  Neutral
The Legend of Tarzan is certainly the most expensive and the most epic adaptation.
  Positive
The special effects available today are an obvious advantage over the old days when wed see Tarzan yelling and then wed cut to stock footage of animals in the jungle.
  Negative
But theres always been something a bit ridiculous about the whole Tarzan premise, and while the talented cast and a solid director make for a serviceable and intermittently entertaining adventure, theres very little about this film that screams, YOU GOTTA SEE THIS.
  Negative
And that includes the alleged D, which is put to terrific use in exactly one shot late in the movie and is otherwise a non-factor.
  Negative
Its the late s. Alexander Skarsgard True Blood plays John Clayton III, the Earl of Greystoke, lord of the manor, husband to the beautiful Jane Margot Robbie and respected member of British politics and society.
  Positive
Hes also a celebrity who is mobbed by children and adored by all because they know his backstory: parents marooned after a shipwreck, Mom and Dad die, raised by apes, lord of the jungle, talked to the animals, etc., etc.
  Negative
Ah, but thats all in the past until an American named George Washington Williams Samuel L. Jackson, sporting a distracting hairpiece I think was designed to make him look younger persuades John to return home to the Congo to investigate rumors the King of Belgium is using slave labor.
  Negative
We never see the evil King of Belgium  but he cant possibly be more mustache-twirlingly rotten to the core than his emissary, the slithering, manipulative, psychopathic Captain Rom, who is played by Christoph Waltz, and while Christoph Waltz is a great actor, it might be time for him to take a break from playing villains who love the sound of their own voices.
  Negative
The casting is almost too easy.
  Negative
The plucky Jane, whos considerably more resourceful and independent than just about every previous incarnation of the character, insists on accompanying John.
  Negative
After all, the Congo was Janes home too' she grew up there because her father was a missionaryeducator.
  Negative
George Washington Williams is handy with a shotgun and loyal to his new friend, but the character exists mainly for comic relief and to look on in astonishment as John reunites with old friends including lions and elephants.
  Positive
Which brings us to perhaps the most serious drawback of the film: the jungle creatures.
  Neutral
Theyre all CGI, and far too many times, they look VERY CGI.
  Negative
Some of the apes have more animated facial expressions than mid-s Jim Carrey, while ostriches, the aforementioned lions, hippos and other creatures look great from a distance but not so believable when the humans are interacting with them.
  Negative
The Legend of Tarzan also stalls a bit whenever John or Jane gazes into the distance, indicating its time for another flashback sequence about Johns boyhood in the jungle and then his first meeting with Jane, when he sniffs her and picks at her and then nearly dies protecting her.
  Negative
The good stuff: Skarsgards a specimen who manages to not look silly when hes swinging from tree to tree or nuzzling lions, and hes a decent enough actor.
  Positive
Robbie looks great and gives Jane loads of sass, even when shes shackled and verbally sparring with the loathsome Captain Rom.
  Negative
Djimon Honsou has a couple of memorable moments as the tribal chief who wants Tarzan dead  and for a legitimate reason.
  Positive
Its also an upgrade from previous Tarzan films to see the Congolese portrayed as a proud, smart, family- and community-oriented people.
  Positive
Though theres still a lot of Tarzan hero worship going on  even though it appears as though half the men in Tarzans home village are just about as good as he is when it comes to the whole running-climbing-jumping-survival thing.
  Neutral
