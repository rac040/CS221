f The Maltese Falcon met The Big Lebowski met Chinatown met The Long Goodbye  well, first of all, thats the beginning of a great film festival, and also youd get Inherent Vice.

In a movie world where Mark Wahlberg takes on giant talking robots is a typical plot description, here we have the great stylist Paul Thomas Anderson Boogie Nights, Magnolia, There Will Be Blood turning a Thomas Pynchon novel into a -minute head trip starring Joaquin Phoenix as a barefoot hippie detective with Neil Young sideburns named Doc who gets embroiled in a tangled web involving a former girlfriend named Shasta, who wants to stop a plot to have her married lover committed to a mental institution, even as a square-jawed cop named Bigfoot is obsessed with bringing down Doc.

And thats just the start of the madness.

If you have a friend who elbows you throughout movies and says things like, Whos that guy again?

and Why does she want him dead?
  Negative
dont take that friend to this movie, because you will end up with fractured ribs by the end of the film.

I was asking many of those questions to myself during this sometimes frustrating, sometimes hilarious and always entertaining hot mess of a film.

Phoenix is perfectly cast as the perpetually befuddled Doc, a private detective of sorts who immerses himself in pot as he wryly observes his own misadventures almost as if theyre happening to someone else.

As is the case with so many film noirs  even film noirs bathed in the relentless sunshine of Southern California  it all begins with a visit from a femme fatale.
  Negative
Katherine Waterston is Docs ex, one Shasta Fay Hepworth, whos all long legs and cut-off jean shorts and manipulative trouble.
  Negative
Its a brave performance from Ms. Waterston, including a scene in which she bares all and messes with Docs mind and his heart and everything else in a way seldom seen in a mainstream film.
  Positive
Doc is so stoned hes not even sure Shastas really there in the room with him  but she is, and she needs his help.
  Negative
Shasta is currently involved with a mysterious and scary businessman named Mickey Wolfmann Eric Roberts, in a terrific extended cameo, and she needs Docs help in thwarting the plot by Mickeys wife and the wifes lover.

Instead of telling Shasta to take a hike, Doc plunges right through the rabbit hole.

And then theres Josh Brolins Bigfoot, a ham-fisted copper who has bit parts on TV shows such as Adam- and is always on the verge of exploding with rage  except when hes at home, and hes the henpecked husband to a constantly nagging wife.
  Negative
Its a brilliant comedic performance from Brolin as a blockhead buffoon who knows the truth about himself and tries to cover it with a linebackers machismo.
  Positive
You could watch Inherent Vice with a notebook, putting together one of those cop-movie flow charts starting with Docs name in a box at the top and all kinds of lines connecting the rest of the characters.
  Negative
Dont do that.
  Neutral
That would be crazy.

About halfway through the film, I stopped leaning forward and trying to puzzle it out in favor of letting the weirdness and the black comedy wash over me.
  Negative
I stopped worrying too much about the connections between characters named Sauncho Smilax, Adrian Prussia, Dr. Buddy Tubeside and Petunia Leeway and enjoyed the ride.
  Very positive
Why shouldnt we be as perplexed as Doc himself?
  Negative
Inherent Vice isnt one of Andersons best films, but even when hes engaging in a self-indulgent lark of a prose poem about the curtain call for the hippie-dippie, psychedelic hippies, the result is more interesting and dazzling than the vast majority of mainstream fare.
  Positive
In , reviewers might have recommended you see this movie stoned.

Id say youre better off seeing it without even a shadow of a hangover.
  Neutral
Its a trip all by itself.
