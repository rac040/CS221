The HBO series Entourage was a slick, funny, sexy slice of eye candy, loosely based on Mark Wahlbergs early adventures in Hollywood as a rising star  but by the time the show ended its seven-year run in , it had already been spinning its wheels for a couple of years.
  Negative
Four years later, here comes Entourage the movie, and its like catching up with an old friend and remembering why you dont hang out with him anymore: Hes stuck in a rut and he has nothing new to say.

You know a movies in trouble when several minutes are devoted to a Piers Morgan interview with Vinnie and E. Piers Morgan as Piers Morgan?

Written and directed by series creator Doug Ellin, Entourage the movie picks up just a few days after the events of the series finale, and heres your SPOILER ALERT.
  Negative
When we last saw the gang, Ari had just been offered the opportunity to run a studio' E was trying to make a go of it with a pregnant Sloan Emmanuelle Chriqui' Vincent was getting married' and Johnny Drama and Turtle were, um, being Johnny Drama and Turtle.
  Negative
Now Vinnies getting an instant divorce, E and Sloan are on the outs, a slimmed-down Turtle is pursuing UFC superstar Ronda Rousey, Johnny Drama is humiliated on the Internet and on an audition and Aris freaking out because his first movie as a studio chief is a  million remake of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde called Hyde, with Vincent directing himself as the title character, whos now a DJ.
  Very negative
The movie within the movie is even worse than it sounds.
  Negative
Even the insider-Hollywood stuff feels a bit off.
  Negative
Ari jets down to Texas to plead with a billionaire Billy Bob Thornton and his idiot son Haley Joel Osment for a few extra million to finish Hyde.
  Negative
The son comes back with Ari and essentially holds the movie hostage in a series of scenes that feel cartoonishly inaccurate.
  Negative
The Hollywood of Entourage is overflowing with gorgeous women, all of whom will go home with Vincent if he even looks in their direction.
  Very positive
At least Debi Mazar as Vinnies publicist and Constance Zimmer as an exec are strong women with real careers.
  Neutral
Theres gratuitous nudity, lots of partying, zippy camera moves, plenty of product placement and did we mention all those celebrity cameos?
  Negative
It all feels more like a rerun than a fully formed, stand-alone movie.
