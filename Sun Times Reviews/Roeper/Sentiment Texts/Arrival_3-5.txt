No sense in pretending Denis Villeneuves Arrival isnt as loopy as it is lofty, as confounding as it is exhilarating, as confusing as it is enlightening.
  Negative
Im not gonna tell you I understood every little thing going on between Amy Adams and those extraterrestrial beings, or between Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner, or between Amy Adams and Forest Whitaker, or between the whole lot of 'em and yours truly, the viewer.
  Negative
Because I didnt.
  Positive
And if you see this film and you comprehend every intricate nut and bolt of it: good for you.
  Positive
But even most of the WTH What the Heck!
  Positive
moments were beautiful and challenging and cool in a thought-provoking, intergalactic kind of way.
  Very positive
Arrival is not the kind of alien invasion movie where all sense of mystery and wonder is quickly stripped away in favor of epic CGI battle sequences in which a band of hopelessly outgunned, wisecracking misfits figure out a way to destroy the Mother Ship or the Queen Bee or whatever.
  Negative
Its SO much better than that, in a Close Encounters, Contact, Interstellar, The Day the Earth Stood Still kind of way.
  Negative
To be sure, there are some eerie sci-fi goose-bump scares, and some well-choreographed action sequences, and familiar tropes such as establishing shots of a sprawling military base camp set up near the enormous spaceship, or whatever it is, ominously hovering on U.S. territory.
  Negative
Mostly, though, Arrival plays like a high-end, handsomely appointed, feature-length version of a classic Twilight Zone episode.
  Neutral
Most of the thrills and chills are of the intellectual and philosophical sort, and were asked to take a leap of faith when it comes to the time-space continuum, and why not, lets do it.
  Negative
Amy Adams, that wonderful chameleon of an actress, is certain to attract Oscar nomination talk with her fierce and wonderfully nuanced work as Louise Banks, an expert linguistics professor leading a quiet and somewhat lonely and isolated life.
  Positive
SPOILER ALERT: An extended prologue about Louise and her daughter gives us some insight as to why Louise is such an internalized, emotionally numb soul.
  Negative
We think.
  Neutral
As Arrival unspools, we begin to question everything we thought we knew at the outset.
  Negative
Louise is so out of touch with the outside world she seems to be the last person on campus to notice theres a huge piece of breaking news blowing up on everyones laptops and personal communication devices:
Aliens have landed.
  Negative
A dozen identical black ships, each looking a bit like a gigantic football sliced in half, have landed in locations around the globe.
  Negative
Because Louise is arguably the most skilled linguist in the world, she finds herself on a U.S. military transport, along with theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly Jeremy Renner, to one such landing spot in Montana.
  Negative
Theyve been recruited by Forest Whitakers Col. Weber to see if they can establish some sort of communication with the mysterious creatures residing within those ominously quiet ships.
  Negative
The ordeal of merely getting into position to come face to face with the aliens makes for an exhausting, crazy, tense, even darkly funny sequence during which you have to remember to breathe.
  Negative
Louise and Ian are equal parts terrified and beyond thrilled to be a part of this insane and historic breakthrough.
  Negative
Little surprise: Even as Louise and Ian essentially invent a new language to communicate with the aliens, who come to be known as heptapods, communication problems among humans threaten the very existence of the planet.
  Negative
The Chinese are getting impatient' they want to blast the spaceship in THEIR backyard to oblivion.
  Negative
An uneasy alliance among nations quickly disintegrates into potential every-country-for-itself madness.
  Negative
Sicario is an immensely talented stylist who knows its best not to show TOO much of the aliens.
  Very positive
Its almost always best not to show too much of the aliens, or the shark, or anything inspiring great apprehension among the humans.
  Positive
He is currently helming Blade Runner , and everything we see in Arrival gives us cause for great hope.
  Positive
This is beautifully filmed work.
  Very positive
Eric Heisserers adaptation and expansion of Ted Chiangs short story titled 'Story of Your Life'weaves seamlessly between genres, from the poignant, heartbreaking story of Louise and her daughter, to the sci-fi adventure, to the Big Idea stuff.
  Neutral
Im not entirely convinced the ending is the perfect landing to everything that transpired before, but Arrival is not a linear adventure of the mind, and it is a film probably best seen twice.
  Positive
