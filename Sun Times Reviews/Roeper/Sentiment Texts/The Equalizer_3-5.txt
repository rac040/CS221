One of these movies, a former government operative played by Liam Neeson is going to walk into a -hour diner and sit across the table from a former government operative played by Denzel Washington, quietly slide a folder across the table to him and say, I think were tracking the same guy.
  Negative
In the meantime, while Neeson is taking A Walk Among the Tombstones, Washington shows up as The Equalizer, and its a coin toss as to which youd least like to meet in a dark alley.
  Negative
Either way, youre toast.
  Negative
David Harbour plays a villain in Tombstones and Equalizer, but its two different characters in two different time periods.
  Neutral
Nevertheless, good luck, David Harbour.
  Positive
Washington reunites with his Training Day director Antoine Fuqua for The Equalizer, based on the s series of the same name.
  Negative
This is a ridiculous, audacious, violent and did I mention ridiculous thriller, with Washington displaying superhero-level prowess when it comes to taking down a roomful of snarling, tattooed, heavily armed bad guys half his age.
  Very negative
One minute theyre snickering and sneering at the old man, the next theyre scattered about the room like the remnants of a fireworks show.
  Negative
Fuqua and screenwriter Richard Wenk set the table quite nicely, thank you, with simple scenes of Washingtons Robert McCall going through his daily and nightly ritual.
  Positive
Late middle-aged, his head shaven, Robert works at a mega-store in Boston, where his younger co-workers speculate on what he did before he did this.
  Neutral
I was a Pip, says Robert, as in a backup singer for Gladys Knight.
  Negative
They almost buy it.
  Neutral
At night, unable to sleep, Robert haunts a diner where he sips tea and reads books such as The Old Man and the Sea.
  Negative
This being a movie diner, theres a pie-loving teen prostitute named Teri Chloe Grace Moretz who hangs out at the diner as well, and eventually she and Robert becomes friends.
  Negative
Seeking to win Teris freedom, Robert casually strolls into the headquarters of her Russian pimp.
  Positive
Lets just say things dont go well.
  Neutral
And it goes down in a manner that would have Tarantino applauding.
  Negative
Denzel Washington's 'Equalizer' role a mystery even to him
A Russian oligarch sends his top fixer, Teddy Marton Csokas, in a chillingly wonderful performance worthy of a Bond villain, to find out what the hell is happening in Boston.
  Positive
Robert keeps his job at the warehouse and continues his mild obsessive-compulsive behavior the exact same ritual every morning, a certain way of arranging tableware and napkins, but once hes returned to his Equalizer ways, he fully embraces it.
  Neutral
Hes almost like the Batman of Boston  taking down corrupt cops, tracking down the punks who robbed the store where he works, and systematically dispatching the hit men and the henchmen who try to take him out.
  Negative
The extreme violence is punctuated by some much-needed humor, as when Robert confronts Teddy in a posh restaurant and they have a restrained conversation that might as well have subtitles saying, Im going to kill you!
  Negative
No, Im going to kill YOU!
  Neutral
or when Robert mentors his overweight co-worker Ralphie Johnny Skourtis, who has dreams of becoming a security guard if only he can pass the physical fitness exam.
  Negative
Were deep into the film before we learn the particulars of Roberts past, but we can pretty much guess his deal after the first time he springs into action.
  Negative
Hes like an AARP version of Jason Bourne, only instead of trying to remember, he wishes he could forget.
  Negative
Denzel Washington is of course a world-class movie star, and he brings all the gifts that make him great to the table, even when hes smack-dab in the middle of an extended shootout scene so stylized it would have to be toned down for a graphic novel.
  Positive
The Equalizer features some gruesomely creative violence, but its equally memorable for the small, gritty moments set in that diner, or on the rough-and-tumble streets of Boston.
  Negative
And most of all, its got Denzel going for it.
  Positive
