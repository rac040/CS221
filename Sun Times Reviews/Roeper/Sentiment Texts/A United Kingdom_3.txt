The moment we hear the Important Historical Movie score swelling up and we read the title card telling us A United Kingdom was inspired by true events, we know a few things.
  Positive
We know this movie will almost certainly end with a freeze-frame of the two actors portraying real-life figures at the most triumphant moment of their lives  and we know that shot will dissolve to archival photos of the actual people, followed by graphics telling us what happened to them in the years and decades after the time of the movie.
  Positive
Loving from just a couple of months ago, and the majority of these films use a cinematic comfort-food recipe that simplifies events by giving us hiss-worthy villains, and turning the lead characters into near-saintly figures.
  Negative
A United Kingdom follows the playbook from start to finish, and that very predictability had me wavering until the very end between a reluctant pass and a mild recommendation  but thanks in large part to the genuine movie-star charisma of David Oyelowo and to the breathtakingly beautiful on-location cinematography in Botswana, here we are with the arrow pointing up.
  Negative
The handsome, quietly commanding Oyelowo, a versatile actor often cast in historical dramas Selma, Queen of Katwe, The Butler, Lincoln, plays Seretse Khama, an African law student in  London.
  Positive
We know hes a fighter because the first time we see him, hes literally fighting  in the boxing ring, against a white pug who calls him a racist slur and head-butts him.
  Negative
One night at a church dance the local priest invites black foreign students in the hopes of converting them, Seretse locks eyes with Ruth Williams Rosamund Pike, a meek girl who seems to have no social life.
  Negative
Put it this way: If you watched Downton Abbey, remember Lady Edith, the wallflower sister?
  Neutral
In this movie, Laura Carmichael, who played Lady Edith, is the FUN sister to Pikes dishwater-dull Ruth.
  Negative
Just in case we missed it the first time, Seretse and Ruth lock eyes again.
  Negative
And one more time.
  Positive
By the time he asks her to dance, they might as well be printing up wedding invitations.
  Negative
Of course, what with this being , such a courtship presents myriad issues  especially when Seretse reveals to Ruth he has to return home to his African homeland of Bechuanaland, because what do you know, hes the heir to the throne.
  Negative
So when Seretse proposes to Ruth, hes also asking her to become the white queen of an African nation with some independence but ultimately under the rule of the United Kingdom.
  Negative
Further complicating matters: Bechuanaland borders South Africa, which is on the verge of enforcing apartheid policies of strict racial segregation.
  Negative
The British government considers South Africa a key ally for a number of strategic and financial reasons, and the last thing it wants to do is antagonize its leaders by officially sanctioning the marriage between Seretse and Ruth.
  Negative
Seretses family also vehemently opposes the marriage.
  Positive
How can Seretse return to his homeland with a white, British woman to rule by his side as the queen?
  Neutral
Oyelowo and Pike have solid chemistry together.
  Positive
Oyelowo gets the big, speechifying, showcase moments  but Pike shines in quieter scenes, whether shes somewhat naively shocked by coldness and casual racism, or touched by acts of kindness from the villagers who initially rejected her.
  Positive
Director Amma Asante and screenwriter Guy Hibbert provide multiple, mostly one-dimensional adversaries, including Jack Davenport as the elegantly slimy and fictional British civil servant who takes sadistic pleasure in punishing Ruth and Seretse at every turn, and Tom Felton Draco Malfoy from the Harry Potter movies as the sniveling, sneering Rufus Lancaster another fictional character, the British district commissioner determined to keep Seretse exiled from his home country unless he divorces Ruth.
  Negative
Despite the lack of nuance in the characters as written, fine work from both actors.
  Positive
Queen of Katwe.'
  Neutral
Hes a great actor, and these are very good roles.
  Positive
But Id love to see him as the lead in a sharp buddy comedy, or a modern romance.
  Positive
Of course hes done roles other than the aforementioned historical dramas, but it would be nice to see the resume expand as it should for any actor of such talent.
  Negative
