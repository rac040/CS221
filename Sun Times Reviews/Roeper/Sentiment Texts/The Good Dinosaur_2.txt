Ah, theres nothing like a Pixar family film that could give the little ones some serious nightmares.

The Good Dinosaur is one strange, aggressively gross and dark adventure, featuring a number of frightening storms' some primary characters getting knocked unconscious andor suffering grievous injuries' creatures eating other creatures  and biting.
  Negative
Lots and lots and LOTS of biting.
  Positive
From a dinosaur who bit off the end of her own tail to escape death to grotesque flying killers that chomp at everyone in their sight to a little boy who bites EVERYTHING he can get his teeth on, youve never seen so much biting in a movie.
  Negative
Exiting the -D screening, I half-expected to see teeth marks on my arm.
  Negative
The Good Dinosaur begins with the premise of a giant asteroid just missing Earth some  million years ago, meaning dinosaurs avoided extinction would eventually share the planet with evolving humans.
  Negative
Flash forward several million years, and we meet a lime green Apatosaurus family that has a working farm where they grow corn and even have a chicken coop.
  Negative
Told you this movie was weird.
  Negative
Theres the strong and noble Poppa Henry Jeffrey Wright, delivering his lines as if trying to out-James Earl Jones Mufasa from The Lion King, kind and protective Momma Frances McDormand and their three little ones: the fearless and playful Buck Marcus Scribner' smart and sweet Libby Maleah Padilla and our hero, the timid Arlo Raymond Ochoa, who lives in a constant state of hesitance and fear.

SPOILER ALERT!
  Positive
After a classic Disney tragedy befalls the family, Arlo goes chasing after the little critter he holds responsible.
  Negative
The critter scampers about on all fours, howls at the moon, eats nasty bugs while theyre still alive and sniffs everything like a puppy  but hes actually a wild little boy who comes to be known as Spot.
  Negative
The dinosaurs in this movie talk.
  Positive
The humans do not.
  Neutral
Guess we caught up with them a few million years later.
  Neutral
Arlo cant stand Spot at first, but when circumstances leave Arlo lost and far from home, its Arlo and Spot against the world.
  Negative
And what a crazy, colorful, dangerous world it is.
  Positive
Director Peter Sohn and the usual army of greatly gifted animation pros deliver some stunning visuals, in particular some sweeping long shots showcasing the hilly terrain, the raging rivers, the storm-filled skies and the majestic mountains of the era.
  Positive
But theres a seemingly endless supply of odd-looking, often dangerous creatures lurking in the tall grass and the woods  and in the skies.
  Negative
A nasty snake that looks like a slithering dragon tries to take out Arlo.
  Negative
When the frequent, treacherous and dangerous storms finally end, a band of ugly, hunter-scavenger pterodactyls swoop in to claim their prey.

Perhaps strangest of all is an extended sequence involving Sam Elliott as a weathered old T-Rex who along with his son and daughter has a herd of water buffaloes.
  Neutral
All of a sudden were in a dinosaur cowboy movie.
  Negative
Oh wait, even stranger: a sequence where Arlo and Spot ingest some sort of hallucinogenic plant and get really, REALLY high.
  Negative
The Good Dinosaur is wildly uneven, but you have to give it points for trying to be something different.
  Negative
The screenplay-by-committee delivers a couple of huge laughs, and one beautifully rendered sentimental scene where Arlo and Spot communicate their family histories to one another.
  Very positive
But dinosaurs  even talking, bright green, sweet dinosaurs  dont make for the most visually pleasant animated creatures, and Arlo isnt a particularly strong or lovable character compared to so many previous Pixar leads, animal or human.
  Positive
Its been a long road to the big screen for The Good Dinosaur.
  Neutral
The original director was replaced.
  Neutral
The release date was delayed a year and a half.
  Neutral

  Neutral
The final product reflects that bumpy path.
  Positive
Inconsistent and weird, The Good Dinosaur is second-level Pixar all the way.
  Negative
