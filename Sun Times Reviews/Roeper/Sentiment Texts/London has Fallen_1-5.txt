Its your fault I had to endure London Has Fallen.
  Negative
Well maybe not YOU specifically  but because moviegoers around the world contributed to the  Die Hard ripoff Olympus Has Fallen earning more than  million at the box office, we now get a sequel, which as you might have surmised from the title is set mostly in London.
  Negative
Like the original, London Has Fallen features a top-notch cast and some crackling good action sequences.
  Positive
And, alas, like the original, this is a clich-riddled, aggressively violent, laughably plotted exploitation flick that leaves few stereotypes unturned.
  Negative
Its slick trash.
  Neutral
You wonder how the likes of Academy Award winners Morgan Freeman and Melissa Leo, as well as reliable veterans Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart, Angela Bassett, Robert Forster and Radha Mitchell were able to maintain straight faces while reciting some of their lines.
  Negative

When the British prime minister dies unexpectedly, leaders from around the world travel to London for the funeral, with security at peak levels.
  Negative
Mike accompanies the president to the service, and lets just say it doesnt go off without a hitch.
  Neutral
Cue the painfully realistic CGI shots of famous London landmarks exploding and burning to the ground, British citizens running for their lives, bodies flying through the air in slow motion, soldiers and security details exchanging gunfire with terrorists  and Mike outwitting and outshooting everyone as he narrowly escapes with the president.
  Negative
Cut to the obligatory war room scene in Washington, where Vice President Allan Trumbull Morgan Freeman, Secretary of Defense Ruth McMillan Melissa Leo, Gen. Edward Clegg Robert Forster and Chief of Staff DC Mason Jackie Earle Haley, among others, have gathered to say things like Oh my God as they watch events unfurl.
  Negative
When the terrorist Aamir Barkawi Alon Moni Aboutboul appears on the monitor in the war room and starts talking trash, Defense Secretary McMillan helpfully informs the room Barkawi is No.
  Negative
on the list of the FBI's  Most Wanted.

Did No.
  Negative
seem too clichd, while No.
  Negative
didn't seem evil enough?
  Neutral
Barkawi tells the Americans his group is going to strike cities around the nation  and torture and execute the president live on the Internet.

Just imagine every major city descending into chaos, he snarls.
  Negative
Your president dies tonight.
  Negative
Meanwhile, Mike and President Asher are isolated and on the run, unable to communicate with allies and barely a step ahead of the swarms of terrorists closing in on them.
  Negative
It seems only a matter of time before theyre captured.
  Negative
I will not be executed as propaganda, Asher tells Mike.
  Negative
You dont let that happen!
  Neutral
If it comes to it, I want you to kill me.
  Negative
Thats an order.
  Neutral
Eckhart delivers a one-note performance as the noble but soft President Asher, who once again has to put his life in the hands of the grizzled, world-weary but resourceful Mike, a one-man wrecking machine who continues along the Die Hard' John McClain path.
  Negative
In a telephone exchange with Barkawi in which Barkawi announces his intentions to capture and execute the president, Mike growls, Yeah?
  Negative
You shoulda brought more men!
  Positive
Gerard Butler can do this kind of role in his sleep, and at times he seems to be going through the motions, even during the action sequences.
  Very negative
Its difficult to imagine anyone appearing in this film thought of it as more than a payday.
