'Nicole Kidmans Gertrude Bell meeting Robert Pattinsons T.E. Lawrence in Queen of the Desert.
  Negative
nbsp'
From the score to the setting to the epic wide-screen shots to the title character, most of the primary elements of Queen of the Desert will remind you of Lawrence of Arabia.
  Negative
The quality of the movie will not.
  Negative
For one thing, Robert Pattinson of Twilight fame isnt a bad actor by any means, but hed be the first to tell you he isnt Peter OToole.
  Negative
Nobody was Peter OToole except for Peter OToole.

century and through World War I are the stuff of legend  and potentially powerful dramatic material.

Alas, the great and usually fantastically innovative Werner Herzog has turned Bells story into a conventional, clich-riddled, overly talky and plodding biopic where very little happens for long stretches of time, and we have to endure deadly-dull voice-over narration while looking at admittedly gorgeous scenery and, well, camels.
  Negative
With her Academy Award-nominated turn in Lion and her excellent work on the HBO limited series Big Little Lies, among other recent achievements, Nicole Kidman has been on an wonderful winning streak  and she does fine work here as well, though shes playing a character about half her age in the early portions of the story.

Fresh out of Oxford in the early s and armed with blazing intelligence and a voracious appetite for exploring the world, Gertrude sets off for the British embassy in Tehran, Persia, where her uncle, Sir Frank Lascelles Mark Lewis Jones holds a title equivalent to a modern-day ambassador.
  Negative
Soon Gertrude meets one Henry Cadogan James Franco, a dashing rogue who shows her around Persia, reads poetry to her, marvels at her quick wit and plucky ways, and falls for her as she falls for him.
  Negative
Franco affects a bit of a Well 'ello to you my foine fellow accent.
  Positive
Its not good.
  Negative
At times he seems to altogether forget hes playing a Brit and he just sounds like James Franco.
  Negative
When Henrys relatively brief role in Gertrudes personal journey comes to a conclusion, we forget him much more quickly than does Gertrude.
  Negative
Queen of the Desert dutifully follows Gertrude around Persia, Palestine, Syria, Jordan and other exotic and mysterious and often dangerous locales as she forges her path as a writer, archaeologist, explorer, political officer and even a spy for the British government.
  Negative
Time and again, establishment figures tell Gertrude theres no place for a woman where she wants to go, that its unheard of for a woman to undertake what shes undertaking, etc., etc.
  Negative
All quite true, of course  but why does it have to be depicted in such a formulaic, uninvolving fashion?
  Negative
Familiar and talented actors such as the aforementioned Franco and Pattinson, as well as Damian Lewis as Maj. Charles Richard Doughty-Wylie, a married man who falls for Gertrude show up as fictionalized interpretations of real-life historical figures.
  Negative
Sometimes theres a spark of romance, sometimes not.
  Neutral
Even when theres a spark, it hardly ignites into good old- fashioned, steamy, historical-romance passion.
  Negative
Gertrude and Richard never consummate their attraction, but they exchange letters, leading to yet another exchange of voice-over dialogue as we look at visuals of  camels.
  Negative
Camels traversing endless mounds of sand.

Queen of the Deserts tells us this, but in the manner of a desert-dry historical paper adapted to film.

The result is a well-made invitation to nod off.
