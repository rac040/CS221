  Negative
I smiled at the smart and funny dialogue.
  Very positive
I smiled because its a treat to see such a talented and versatile sketch comedian, supporting actor, TV host and stand-up branch out even more as the writer-director-star of a terrific film that has echoes of Woody Allens romantic comedydrama work from the s and s, as well as more recent films such as Zach Braffs Garden State and the sharp and knowing indie films from Joe Swanberg.

  Neutral
Their relationship is worthy of a movie unto itself.
  Positive
Writer-director Martin does a stellar job of balancing sketch-comedy style laughs with genuinely touching moments.
  Very positive
A confrontation with a guy from that vampire TV show at an art gallery is hilarious, but a small moment when Deans cell phone pings a reminder that says simply, Moms birthday, is heartbreaking.

Think of all the smart phone and Google Calendar and Facebook birthday and anniversary reminders that pop up after weve lost a loved one.
