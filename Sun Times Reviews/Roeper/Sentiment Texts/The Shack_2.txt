Setting aside the quality of the finished product for a moment, I admire those involved with the making of The Shack for even taking on a film with such a literal and bold interpretation of the Christian faith.
  Positive
Lets put it this way: When one character says he always pictured God as a man with a white beard, the very different version of God we see onscreen chuckles and says, Sounds like youre thinking of Santa Claus.
  Negative
When William P. Youngs Christian novel 'The Shack'became a mega-hit in the late s and early s, selling millions of copies, some critics derided the book for its interpretation of Scripture  including the physical manifestations of the Holy Trinity:
 An African-American woman as God the Father
 A Middle Eastern carpenter as His son, Jesus
 An Asian woman as the Holy Spirit.
  Negative
The film adaptation stays true to those depictions, with Octavia Spencer as God the Father, aka Papa, aka Elousia, the Israeli actor Avraham Aviv Alush as a rather mischievous and hippie-like Jesus, and the beautiful Japanese actress Sumire Matsubara as the Holy Spirit, aka Sarayu.
  Negative
And while the gospels of Luke and Matthew indeed say Jesus was a Jew born in Bethlehem, to say The Shack offers a new spin on the Holy Trinity  and some provocative theories about free will, forgiveness and the afterlife  is an understatement.
  Positive
No doubt some Christians will be taken aback and perhaps even offended by the storyline.
  Negative
The religious debate can and should continue outside the boundaries of this review.
  Positive
I welcome your feedback.
  Positive
As always, the primary purpose here is to give you my opinion of the movies merits  and on that count, The Shack is a well-acted and sometimes moving but far too often slow-paced and unconvincing spiritual journey.
  Positive
Sam Worthington Avatar is Mackenzie Phillips, a name that took me out of the movie for a moment because Mackenzie Phillips is the name of the actress and singer whose father was John Phillips of Mamas and Papas fame
Anyway.
  Negative
Hes called Mack most of the time, so well go with Mack.
  Positive
Struggling to hide his Australian accent and looking quite like a -years-ago Pierce Brosnan, Worthington plays an American living in the Northwest who is mired in a place of great sadness and has essentially lost his faith after the disappearance and murder of his youngest daughter, Missy Amelie Eve.
  Negative
Macks wife Nan Radha Mitchell still believes in God and is doing her best to hold the family together.
  Positive
Their son Josh Gage Munroe and their daughter Kate Megan Charpentier havent exactly turned into wild teen rebels, but Sam is so mired in his own grief, hes disconnected from the children, especially Kate, who blames herself for Missys death.
  Very negative
One blustery day, Mack finds an unstamped envelope in the mailbox from Papa the term his wife uses for God, inviting him to meet up at the shack  the very shack where Missy was murdered.
  Negative
With no way of knowing if the note is from the killer or a cruel prankster, or perhaps some other being, Mack sets out alone for the shack.
  Negative
The shack is where we meet Papa and Jesus and Sarayu.
  Neutral
The shack is where Mack must confront his tragic past, contemplate his future and make monumental decisions about the present.
  Negative
Octavia Spencer plays God, literally, as a quietly calming, all-knowing presence.
  Negative
Alushs Jesus is a warm and loving entity  but hes a lightweight and is almost goofy in some scenes.
  Positive
Matsubaras Holy Spirit does a lot of laughing, even when the moment isnt all that funny.
  Positive
At times The Shack goes extremely dark, especially in flashbacks involving Missys death.
  Negative
Theres a creepiness to those scenes, even when the intention is to depict closure.
  Neutral
Also a problem: Tim McGraws Willie, a kindly neighbor wholives across the street from the Phillips family, narrates Macks story.
  Negative
How does Willie know everything, even things Mack supposedly tells only his family about?
  Neutral
Is Willie also some sort of biblical figure?
  Neutral
Its never explained, so it just comes across as kind of weird that Willie knows so much and is so invested in the Phillips family  far more than I ever felt invested as a viewer of the film.
  Negative
