Maybe the blazingly talented Sean Penn has given a worse performance at some point in his film career, whether it was in Shanghai Surprise or even in I Am Sam, Oscar nomination for the latter notwithstanding.
  Negative
Maybe the remarkable Javier Bardem has delivered even hammier work at some point in HIS career, e.g., The Counselor.
  Neutral
Rarely, though, have two Academy Award-winning actors been so stunningly off the mark in the same movie.
  Negative
The Gunman is that movie.
  Neutral
Given the Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!
  Negative
nature of the plot involving an international operative who tries to retire but finds himself engaging in endless shootouts and hand-to-hand combat with mercenaries half his age, and the fact The Gunman is directed by Pierre Morel Taken, one can reasonably surmise the -year-old Penn viewed this as his Liam Neeson moment.
  Positive
Its more like bad Sly Stallone.
  Negative
In fact, the ripped and deeply bronzed Penn looks like he did a stint at the Stallone School of Insanely Rippled and Veiny Muscles.
  Negative
He spends about half the movie shirtless in his role of Jim Terrier what a name, who in  is a military contractor firm tasked with clearing an airport runway in strife-torn Congo.
  Negative
Even though hundreds of thousands of suffering refugees are holed up in camps, and rebel and government forces are pillaging the land for diamonds and other treasures while the people die in the streets, Jim and his boys seem to be having a hell of a good time in the Congo.
  Negative
At night they repair to a ramshackle bar where the drinks flow, and Jim makes out with his beautiful saint of a girlfriend Annie Jasmine Trinca, a doctor who works in a local clinic.
  Negative
Bardems Felix, who works for the firm that has hired Jim and his mates, is obsessed with Annie.
  Negative
We know that because we get about a half-dozen shots of Felix looking longingly at Annie and staring daggers at Jim at that good-time bar.
  Negative
When Felix arranges for Jim to be the triggerman in the assassination of the countrys minister of mining, he knows it will mean Jim will have to flee the country, never to see Annie again.
  Negative
Bahahahahah!
  Neutral
Oh that Felix.
  Neutral
Cut to , where Jim is trying to make amends for past sins by working for a relief organization in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, while unbeknownst to Jim Felix and Annie are married and living in Barcelona.
  Negative
After three mercenaries try to assassinate Jim guess how that turns out, Jim flees the continent again in order to figure out who wants him dead.
  Negative
His travels take him London and then to Spain, as he reunites with his old pals including Ray Winstone and Mark Rylance, and its embarrassing how easy it is to figure out whos really on Jims side and who is setting him up.
  Negative
Forget about foreshadowing.
  Neutral
This movie has five-shadowing.
  Neutral
With the obligatory international thriller techno-score humming in the background and some admittedly gorgeous international scenery as a backdrop, The Gunman follows a predictable pattern: cheesy, semi-tense dialogue when characters confront each other, followed by either a shootout or a Bourne type fight scene, in which our man Jimmy is of course by far the best shot and the best bone-cracker, much to the surprise of the cocky, interchangeable henchmen who come at him one at a time.
  Positive
Bardems Felix is such a missed opportunity.
  Negative
When Jim surprises him in Barcelona, we learn Felix has become an immensely wealthy and powerful businessman now involved in some sort of organization that ostensibly raises money for developing countries.
  Positive
It seems Jim is hopelessly outmatched and outclassed if he expects to win back Annie and find out whos trying to kill him.
  Negative
But within hours, Felix is revealed as a theatrically drunken, insecure fool  and it doesnt help that Bardem plays him as A THEATRICALLY DRUNKEN, INSECURE FOOL!!!
  Negative
Meanwhile, Jim keeps finding excuses to take off his shirt and casually flex his pecs.
  Negative
Hes also suffering from post-concussion syndrome, which Penn portrays by grabbing his head in agony and screaming, as his vision goes blurry and his ears ring while he has horrible flashbacks.
  Very negative
Its a cheap and obvious way to portray a very real and very serious condition.
  Negative
Nobody gets out of this film unscathed.
  Negative
Jasmine Trincas Annie is one of the least believable doctors in recent film history.
  Negative
And when Jim asks her why she married the obviously weak and corrupt and creepy Felix, she says its like when youre in a fire and youre rescued by a firefighter.
  Negative
You owe him a debt, and shes repaying the debt with marriage.
  Positive
Really?
  Neutral
Thats how it works?
  Neutral
Even more ridiculous is the exchange between Idris Elba as the obligatory Interpol chief who meets with Jim on a bench in a public square and delivers a lengthy and tortured metaphor about building a tree house, and how sometimes you need help building the right tree house.
  Negative
Filled with gruesome violence in which the camera lingers on victims after theyve been stabbed in the throat or gored by a bull Im not kidding or shot in the heart, The Gunman veers dangerously close to camp in the final scenes.
  Negative
If you make it that far without walking out.
  Neutral
