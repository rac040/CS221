Just when I thought I had Logan fatigue to the point of not caring if I ever saw the muttonchopped clawmeister ever again, along comes the best Wolverine movie of all.
  Positive
James Mangolds darkly entertaining and surprisingly layered Logan is a brutal, bittersweet and bloody sendoff to one of the most enduring characters in the X-Men universe.
  Positive
The smart and bold script affords Hugh Jackman the opportunity to reinvent his portrayal of LoganWolverine, and the result is one of the best performances of Jackmans career  and one of the most impressive superhero movies of this decade.
  Very positive
Set in a bleak near future in which the X-Men have all but disappeared from the planet and Xaviers School for Gifted Youngsters is no more, Logan is as much a Western as it is a sci-fi thriller.

  Neutral
There are multiple visual and dialogue-driven references to the classic Western Shane.
  Positive
Most important, Logan just has the tone and the pacing and the feel of a Western  a very violent Western in which guts are spilled and heads are severed and characters both evil and good are sent to their Maker after being blown apart by shots to the torso and to the head at medium-close range.
  Negative
The opening scene, in which a drunken, battered Logan rises up against some carjackers who picked the wrong victim, leaves no doubt as to the brutal nature of Logan.
  Very negative
Whereas in most previous Wolverine movies, the violence was largely bloodless and of the CGI variety, this time theres a visceral punch to our senses every time Logans claws come out and start piercing and slicing and dicing.
  Negative
Its the year .
  Neutral
Logan is scraping out a living as an Uber-type limo driver.
  Negative
Hes almost always drunk or hung over or a combination of both.

Enter a frantic, desperate woman named Gabriela Elizabeth Rodriguez from Orange Is the New Black, who tracks down Logan and pleads with him to transport a young girl named Laura Dafne Keen to North Dakota.
  Negative
Turns out Laura, who doesnt speak, is something of a mini-Wolverine.
  Negative

  Very negative
Director Mangold places much of Logan in wide-open, sparsely populated locales, where the big cities and big problems of the world are referenced but not visited.
  Negative
Were on the road, in the woods, at a home in the country, at lonely gas stations and convenience stores.
  Neutral
Even when Logan reluctantly commits to protecting Laura and honoring Charles wishes, its clear hes been battered and bruised inside and out so many times, all he really wants to do is drink and forget and drink so more and try to numb anything resembling human feelings.
  Negative
For all its moodiness and melancholy, Logan is also a rip-roaring action film  and its wickedly funny at times as well.
  Positive
Stewart, who has been playing his character on and off for nearly two decades, gives his usual Shakespearean, magnificent performance.
  Positive
Young Dafne Keen is fierce and endearing.
  Positive
And Hugh Jackman sharpens his claws in every sense of the word and delivers killer work.
