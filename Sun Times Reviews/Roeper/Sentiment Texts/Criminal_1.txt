Id like to believe Criminal stars Kevin Costner, Gary Oldman and Tommy Lee Jones got together for lunch one day during filming, and the conversation went something like this:
Costner: Has it really been  years since we all did JFK?
  Positive
Man, that was a straight-out DOCUMENTARY compared to this piece of s'.
  Negative
Well boys, heres to the paycheck.
  Neutral
Oldman: To the paycheck!
  Neutral
Jones grumbling under his breath: The paycheck.
  Neutral
Given the lurid, stupid, loony and unintentionally laughable nature of this espionage thriller, I found some measure of entertainment studying the vastly different approaches taken by Costner, Jones and Oldman  three of our finest actors over the last  years.
  Neutral
Costner plays lifelong sociopath Jericho Stewart.
  Negative
Brace yourself, as thats the first of many ridiculous names for characters in this film, and unless youre watching a Marx Brothers movie, its almost never a good sign when a film is populated with overly clever character names.
  Very negative
Jericho, were told, has a one-in--million brain condition that makes it impossible to differentiate right from wrong, love from hate.
  Negative
He feels no emotions whatsoever.
  Negative
He doesnt understand how society works.
  Positive
He makes Hannibal Lecter look like your well-adjusted favorite uncle.
  Negative
Costner hurls himself into the role with gusto.
  Positive
Its kinda great.
  Positive
Sporting nasty stitches in his skull more on that in a minute, a stocking cap, a goatee and an olive-green jacket, Jericho looks like a police sketch come to life.
  Negative
In a scene where Jericho befriends a little girl and helps her bury her stuffed elephant dont ask, Costner was grunting so much like Frankenstein's monster I began to fear the little girl was going to hand him daisies and he was going to send her flying.
  Negative
Oldman plays the CIAs London chief, one wait for it Quaker Wells, a ruthless, seemingly unhinged fellow who makes one terrible, shortsighted, idiotic decision after another.
  Negative
Hes also prone to barking things like, Do you think I care if HE dies!
  Negative
and, They dont matter!
  Neutral
the latter comment pertaining to a widow and her child kidnapped by a terrorist.
  Negative
Its a terrible performance by a great actor.
  Very negative
Born-in-London, filming-in-London Oldman is playing an American, and he wrestles with and loses to some kind of harsh accent.
  Very negative
Time and again, lets not forget that name QUAKER WELLS screams bloody murder at subordinates and behaves so irrationally its a wonder he doesnt blow himself up like a cartoon character.
  Negative
And then theres Tommy Lee Jones, who has never looked so tired and so resigned to his acting fate as he does here.
  Negative
Never the most animated of actors, Jones in this role is the human equivalent of an iPhone with a Low Battery warning.
  Negative
He just shuffles and mumbles about, reciting his lines as if someone he loves was being held hostage and he has no choice.
  Negative
Get this.
  Neutral
Jones plays Dr. Franks, as in shorthand for Dr. Frankenstein, because what happens in this movie is, when CIA Agent Bill Pope Ryan Reynolds is killed on assignment, Quaker Wells orders Dr. Franks to perform experimental surgery in which Bills memories can be imprinted on Jerichos brain, because as youll recall, Jericho has that very rare condition, which makes him the perfect recipient for a whole new set of memories.
  Negative
Of course, Jericho IS a psychopath and that part of him wont be erased, but Quaker Wells isnt about to let a little detail like that get in his way.
  Negative
Why are Dead Bills memories so important?
  Negative
Because he just might know the whereabouts of the morally conflicted cyber-terrorist Jan Stroop Michael Pitt, aka The Dutchman, who has developed a deep Internet wormhole giving him control over all of Americas military operation systems.
  Negative
Now that Dr. Franks has downloaded Bills thoughts and experiences into Jerichos brain, Jericho is Americas best hope to find the Dutchman.
  Negative
As Quaker Wells tells his team on more than one occasion, Find the Dutchman!
  Negative
So now weve got Jericho on the loose in London he escapes the clutches of the CIA on multiple occasions.
  Negative
Jericho is still a homicidal maniac, but now Dead Bills memories and emotions are swirling in a kind of cranium cocktail in Jerichos head.
  Negative
One minute Jericho is executing foes, the next hes experiencing soft-focus memories of Dead Bills beautiful wife Wonder Woman herself, Gal Gadot, or hes glimpsing flashes of clues that could lead him to the Dutchman.
  Negative
The Americans hope to find the Dutchman before the Spanish Anarchist as hes identified in a title card Hagbardaka Heimbahl finds him.
  Negative
Ooh, hes a nasty one, that Hagbardaka Heimbahl.
  Negative
Hes one of those terrorists who WILL kidnap a child and point a gun at her head unless he gets his way.
  Negative
Booooo!
  Neutral
Booooo!
  Neutral
Space considerations and a sense of mercy prevent me from telling you about characters named Pete Greensleeves, Shoo Shoo, Admiral Lance, Natalie Whisk and news anchor Matt Chatool.
  Negative
Lucky you.
  Neutral
Selfless as Young Damian, a perfect physical specimen encasing the mind, experience and memories of an elderly real estate mogul who has just died.
  Positive
Here, hes playing a perfect physical specimen who dies but has his memories and emotions implanted into a crusty older guy.
  Negative
And five years ago, Reynolds starred in The Change-Up, in which his dashing bachelor character switches bodies and lives with Jason Batemans happily married family man.
  Negative
Apparently Ryan Reynolds really likes movies about the old switcheroo.
  Positive
Heres hoping he doesnt take it to the point of a male version of Freaky Friday.
  Neutral
