Daniel Craig had some fans quite shaken and others stirred with his declaration last month hed rather slash his wrists than play James Bond again  and though Ive found Craig to be an excellent, badass Bond in his four turns as , maybe its time for a new and fresh edition, because the veteran warhorse is getting a bit careless.
  Negative
Not Craig.
  Neutral
Hes still a tightly coiled, deadpan funny, hardcore charmer as Bond.
  Positive
But in SPECTRE, Bond looks weary and battle-scarred, and hes getting a bit sloppy in his work, whether hes walking away from a spectacular crash scene without making sure a monstrous goon is actually dead, taking note of a security camera but neglecting to destroy surveillance video or saying goodbye to his beautiful lover on an inexplicably empty street in London and walking away without even considering the possibility she might be snatched up by the bad guys the minute she turns the corner.
  Negative
This is not your Connerys James Bond.
  Negative
Back to some other head-scratching moments down the line, but first the good stuff.
  Positive
This is the th Bond film and it ranks solidly in the middle of the all-time rankings, which means its still a slick, beautifully photographed, action-packed, international thriller with a number of wonderfully, ludicrously entertaining set pieces, a sprinkling of dry wit, myriad gorgeous women and a classic psycho-villain who is clearly out of his mind but seems to like it that way.
  Very positive
Director Sam Mendes American Beauty, the previous Bond film Skyfall opens with a breathtaking flourish: a five-minute sequence without a discernible cut set amidst a wild Day of the Dead celebration in Mexico City.
  Positive
We first see Bond dressed as a dashing skeleton  but soon hes on a rooftop in a perfectly tailored gray suit, taking aim at terrorists who are plotting to blow up a stadium filled with thousands of people later that evening.
  Negative
Its a near-perfect bit of action moviemaking, ending with Bond making a hilarious landing.
  Positive
In the first minute of the film, we get the first of more than a dozen references aka Easter Eggs paying tribute to earlier Bond films, from the Rolls Royce in Goldfinger to the Aston Martin ejector seat to the train fight in From Russia with Love to  well, lets leave it at that and just say there are PLENTY more inside jokes and callbacks for the serious Bond fans to enjoy.
  Negative
Cut to the opening credit sequence, with Sam Smith belting out the ballad Writings On the Wall while anonymous women grope a shirtless Bond, and the slithering tentacles of a giant octopus wrap around legs and torsos and whatnot.
  Negative
Live and Let Die this isnt.
  Neutral
And then its back to the movie.
  Neutral
Dame Judi Denchs M is gone, replaced by Ralph Fiennes fussbudget M  but Bonds beloved mentormother figure has left a message from beyond the grave.
  Negative
She wants James to kill a man named Sciarra, and to make sure he attends Sciarras funeral.
  Neutral
Meanwhile, a twerpy bureaucrat named C Andrew Scott has taken over British intelligence and is moving forward with a grand and stupid plan to merge forces with eight other nations to create one global superpower capable of spying on just about everyone at all times  the better to combat the forces of evil, or so he believes.
  Negative
Of course C believes Bond is obsolete, an ancient relic whose time has come and gone.
  Neutral
How long has Bond been hearing THAT song?
  Negative
Bond goes on an international scavenger hunt, from Rome to Austria to Morocco, in an effort to track down the serpents head of an evil organization he eventually learns is called SPECTRE.
  Negative
Along the way we get a novelty for a Bond movie: James has a brief dalliance with the widow of an assassin, and shes his age!
  Positive
Monica Bellucci, who plays the woman in black, is actually four years older than Craig.
  Negative
Ah, but the main romantic interest is Lea Seydouxs Dr. Madeleine Swan, the daughter of one of Bonds former adversaries.
  Neutral
Madeleine is brainy and beautiful and feisty, and about three days after she tells Bond shes not about to fall into his arms seeking solace, shes telling him, I love you.
  Positive
Because hes James Bond.
  Positive
By my count, James takes the controls of a Jaguar and an Aston Martin, one boat, two helicopters and an airplane  and he boards a train for good measure.
  Positive
Talk about a man on the go.
  Neutral
Some of these transportation vehicles seem to materialize out of thin air, as do a couple of plot twists that are confusing at best and cartoonishly convoluted at worst.
  Negative
It takes a long time  a LONG time  for Christoph Waltz to get his moment of madness as Franz Oberhauser, the sadistic mastermind of SPECTRE.
  Negative
Once Franz gets Bond strapped in a torture device and has the opportunity to tell stories from his childhood and explain just exactly how hes going to rip James apart, Waltz doesnt disappoint.
  Negative
His Franz is wonderfully insane, and of course he constructs elaborate puzzles and even invokes the old Countdown Timer to Destruction instead of just putting a bullet in Bonds head when he has the chance.
  Positive
Its nice to see Ben Whishaws Q out in the field, and I dig Naomie Harris take on Moneypenny.
  Positive
Fiennes of course is a first-rate actor, but the script doesn't do justice to M, who comes across as a milquetoast, even when hes holding a gun.
  Negative
Craig is on point as Bond.
  Neutral
Hes maybe the least refined version of , seemingly more comfortable when his suit is covered with soot and dried blood, relishing hand-to-hand combat, kissing women with almost violent passion.
  Negative
Even when hes wearing a white dinner jacket, its as if hes hoping a thug will barge in and grab him by the throat, just to jump start the night.
  Negative
If this indeed is Craigs final appearance as Bond, the last moments of SPECTRE are a fitting sendoff.
  Negative
Not counting the likes of Barry Nelson playing Bond on TV in the s, or the great David Niven as Bond in the  spy spoof Casino Royale, there have been a half-dozen Bonds, from Sean Connery to George Lazenby to Roger Moore to Timothy Dalton to Pierce Brosnan and now Craig.
  Negative
