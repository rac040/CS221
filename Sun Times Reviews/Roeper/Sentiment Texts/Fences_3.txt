  Very positive
Now comes the movie adaptation, with Washington and Davis and supporting players Stephen McKinley Henderson and Mykelti Williamson reprising their stage roles and Washington behind the camera as director of a feature for the third time after Antwone Fisher in  and The Great Debaters in .
  Positive
What works so well on the stage doesnt always pack the same punch through the more naturalistic filter of the film experience, and there are times when Fences the movie feels stagey and over the top.
  Negative
But once you settle in and get comfortable with the speechifying and the cadence and rhythm of the prose poetry, the performances by the main players are a wonder to behold.
  Positive
Set mostly in the mid-s, Fences is in some ways an African-American companion piece to Arthur Millers Death of a Salesman in that it focuses on a tragically dysfunctional family with a bitter patriarch nearing the end of the road' his loving and supportive wife, and their children, not all of whom have found their own path.
  Negative
Washington is a commanding presence as Troy, a longtime sanitation worker in s Pittsburgh who is pushing to go from the back of the truck to the position of driver, a relatively cushy job in that you stay behind the wheel all day and you dont have to sling garbage.
  Positive
On Friday evenings when the last shift of the week is over, Troy and his best friend Bono Henderson embrace the freedom of the weekend by heading to Troys backyard, where they pass the bottle of gin back and forth while Troys wife Rose Davis prepares dinner and basks in the glow of Troys charisma and his declarations of undying love for his wife of so many years.
  Negative
Troy and Rose seem to be blessed and content  but it doesnt take long before myriad cracks poison their way through the happy faade.
  Positive
Troys brother Gabriel Williamson suffered severe brain damage in World War II and is now a sad, delusional, childlike wild card roaming the streets of the neighborhood.
  Negative

  Positive

  Negative

  Positive
Troys teenage son Cory Jovan Adepo is a football prodigy with dreams of playing in college.
  Negative
But Troy, a former Negro League baseball star who played before Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier and never got a shot at the big leagues, is so bitter about his own athletic experience he refuses to sign the paperwork for Coryto go to college and forces his son to quit the high school team and find work.
  Negative
Thats just the half of it.
  Neutral
Suffice to say that while we initially feel for Troy and all hes endured in his hardscrabble life, we come to see how nearly everything that goes sour for his family is of Troys doing.
  Negative
The moment when Rose is forced to face the full measure of Troys selfishness leads to arguably the most powerful monologue in any movie of , with Viola Davis pretty much sewing up the Oscar for best supporting actress  and deservedly so.
  Positive
Washingtons direction is solid but nothing special.
  Negative
He finds a few ways to expand the adaptation beyond the constraints of the stage play  but all of the most effective scenes take place in the house and the backyard.
  Positive
The closing scenes could have been tightened  its a very long goodbye  and some of the messages and symbolism could have been delivered in a more nuanced fashion.
  Negative
The final shot is a tough sell.
  Positive
What works: the brilliant dialogue, and the raw intensity of the performances.
  Very positive
Its a privilege to watch Washington and Davis lay it all on the line.
