The very best Pixar films arent just childrens movies with references and touchstones to keep the adults interested' theyre ambitious, complex, deeply layered movies for grown-ups that happen to be populated with characters, colors and primary stories that appeal to children as well.

Who chokes up more at certain scenes from the Toy Story movies or Finding Nemo or Up  first-graders, or their parents and grandparents, who can fully relate to and understand whats happening on all levels?

Its one of the best movies of the year, period.
  Positive
Based on an original idea by Pete Docter Up, Monsters, Inc. and co-directed by Docter and Ronaldo Del Carmen, Inside Out does a wonderful job of laying out the groundwork for the story to come in the opening sequences, in which a little girl named Riley Kaitlyn Dias is born in Minnesota and experiences the first few years of life.
  Negative
We see Rileys world through the emotions in her head  where well be spending the bulk of the movie itself.
  Positive
The story takes us outside Rileys mind and into the real world just often enough for us to appreciate what shes going through, and sometimes what her parents are feeling.
  Positive
Its all done with a deft touch.
  Positive
Our narrator and tour guide is Joy Amy Poehler, perfectly voice-cast and terrific throughout, a sort of a whirling, glowing Emoticon-Tinkerbell hybrid who introduces us to Rileys other primary emotions, including:
 Sadness Phyllis Smith from The Office, who can literally color memories forever simply by touching them.
  Very positive
Fear Bill Hader, who views every experience as potentially disastrous, but is sometimes a valuable asset.
  Positive
Anger Lewis Black, of course!
  Neutral
, ready to throw a tantrum whenever things dont go Rileys way.
  Negative
Disgust Mindy Kaling, who, like the other emotions, has shades of other traits.
  Negative
Disgust can be quite the little narcissist.
  Negative
At first things are pretty simple and straightforward for Baby Riley, as she experiences the Joy of parental love, Disgust when she tastes broccoli, Fear of noisy household appliances, etc., etc.
  Negative
But then we jump forward to Rileys world at age , when the family moves to San Francisco because her father has a new job opportunity  and Riley has to cope with everything from tension between her parents to living in a less-than-desirable neighborhood to missing her friends to feeling like an outcast at her new school.
  Negative
Things are getting COMPLICATED inside Riley Central.
  Negative
Its like an animated Wizard of Oz adventure within Rileys mind.

Rileys memories arrive in the form of color-coded orbs and are stored away.

  Negative
Thats where we meet the discarded but still fiercely loyal Bing Bong, Rileys imaginary friend from childhood, who is voiced by the invaluable Richard Kind.
  Positive
Oh, Bing Bong.
  Negative
He will melt your heart.
  Positive
As Riley becomes increasingly sad and resentful, Joy goes on a desperate quest to regain control or at least once again become a constant presence in Rileys life, lest Disgustand Fear and Anger remain at the controls forever.
  Negative
The Pixar animation team outdoes itself with vast, intricate, amazingly detailed landscapes ranging from the movie studio where Rileys dreams are produced every night with a sly nod to Hitchcock, among other filmmakers to Rileys long-term memory bank shes forgotten nearly all of her piano lessons, but an annoying jingle for chewing gum will be popping into her head forever to the places where Rileys subconscious and abstract thinking reside.
  Negative
Not to mention the Train of Thought, which is literally a Train.
  Negative
Of Thought.
  Neutral
Pretty complicated fare for a Pixar film  or for any film, come to think of it  and viewers a few years younger than Rileys  will probably get a little fidgety and a little frightened by some of the proceedings.
  Neutral
Lets just say Rileys primary nightmare is something to which nearly all of us can relate, regardless of age.
  Negative
But even if some of the references go sailing over their heads, theres such a visual feast in every frame of this film, its hard to imagine any child growing restless even during the darker and more complex passages.
  Negative
Directed with great flair and pitch-perfect timing, brimming with sparkling visuals, filled with first-rate voice performances, thrilling adventures and unforgettable moments, Inside-Out is an instant classic.
  Very positive
Someday the children of the children who will love this film, will love this film.
