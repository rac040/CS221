At , Woody Allen is the filmmaker equivalent of the dad or grandfather who has almost zero interest in modern pop culture but loves to go through old photo books while listening to the music of a bygone era while telling anyone within earshot, Those were the days.
  Negative
Allens th film, Caf Society, is set in the s and touches on themes hes explored time and again, from illicit affairs to the mysteries of romance to criminal endeavors played mostly for laughs  and yes, at least one character contemplates the meaning of life and the horrible certainty of death and the utter futility of our day-to-day existence, because whats it all about, REALLY?
  Negative
As Allen explained to me in an interview last year, he doesnt go on vacations and he wouldnt dream of retirement, because the closest he comes to bliss is making the kind of movies he wants to make  and he does it again here, which means were going to see the same style of opening credits weve seen for dozens of other Allen films, and were going to hear originals and faithful covers of music originally released on rpm records, and were going to see a blazingly talented cast fast-talking their way through some brilliant dialogue peppered with keen insights and hit-and-miss one-liners.
  Very positive
At this point, either youre a late-era Woody Allen fan or youre not.
  Negative
You dont go into a Woody Allen film expecting a boatload of surprises.
  Neutral
Caf Society is a gorgeous and lightweight confection, a love letter to the Hollywood of the mid-s, as well as the New York of the same era.
  Very positive
Jesse Eisenberg, whose tics and mannerisms and rapid-fire speech patterns suit him well for the Allen doppelganger role, gives one of his best performances since The Social Network as Bobby Dorfman, a Bronx native eager to make his way in Hollywood.
  Very positive
Bobby arrives with the obligatory Oversized Movie Suitcases in hand and after weeks of trying finally gets a one-on-one with his Uncle Phil Steve Carell, a powerful agent whos so far removed from the family he doesnt even remember Bobbys name.
  Negative
Nonetheless, Phil hires Bobby as a gofer out of a sense of family loyalty.
  Negative
He even instructs his sweet and pretty assistant Veronica Kristen Stewart to show Bobby around Hollywood.
  Negative
Bobby takes one look at Veronica and hes a goner.
  Neutral
Veronica might have a little crush on Bobby as well, but her personal life is  complicated.
  Neutral
Carell is a hoot as the name-dropping power player who takes a shine to Bobby, inviting him into his palatial home and introducing him to various moneyed people and Hollywood artists.
  Positive
Says one two-time Academy Award winner, Youve never heard of me.
  Positive
Im a writer.
  Neutral
Meanwhile, back in New York, Bobbys gangster older brother Ben Corey Stoll is getting involved in all manner of violent hijinks  but even though Ben is a murderous thug, as played by Stoll hes the funniest thing in the movie.
  Positive
Some of Bens most nefarious deeds are orchestrated for darkly comedic effect.
  Neutral
Circumstances lead Bobby back to New York, where he winds up running a chic nightclub owned by his mobster brother.
  Negative
Eisenberg does a smooth and effortless job of showing Bobby segue from a nave fish-out-of-water in Hollywood to a supremely confident and charismatic man about town in New York City.
  Positive
We can almost believe a drop-dead gorgeous woman who also happens to be named Veronica Blake Lively would be swept off her feet within hours of meeting the slick and charming Bobby.
  Negative
Almost.
  Neutral
After all, were talking about Blake Lively here, whos as photogenic as the silver screen stars referenced time and again in Caf Society.
  Negative
As wonderful as the acting is, the legendary cinematographer Vittorio Storaro three-time Oscar winner, for Apocalypse Now, Reds and The Last Emperor might be the biggest star of the film.
  Positive
Though it might once have been thought sacrilege for Storaro to shoot digitally, his work with a Sony K camera yields rich, golden and stunning deep tones in the Hollywood scenes, and early Godfather textures in the New York sequences.
  Positive
Its a beautiful thing to behold.
