But then some pesky humans show up and try to capture him or tame him or kill him or otherwise mess with him, and the next thing you know the big guy is swatting away aircraft, roaring up a storm and defending his turf while developing a real resentment for the little pests in clothes  with the exception of the occasional sympathetic blonde who catches his eye, of course.

Kong: Skull Island plays like a mash-up of Apocalypse Now, Hamburger Hill, Congo, Jurassic Park, even The African Queen  with a couple of elements so ridiculous they could have been borrowed from a Gilligans Island episode.

Its wildly entertaining and it has a sense of humor about itself  and it doesnt hurt when a great big monster movie features an A-list cast including John Goodman, Samuel L. Jackson, Brie Larson, Tom Hiddleston and John C. Reilly.

  Negative
This isnt just some arbitrary device' the war and how it affected those who fought it and those who fought against it is a constant theme in Skull Island.
  Negative
The opening half hour or so feels like more like a Vietnam film than a monster movie, with the soundtrack blasting classic rock staples such as White Rabbit, Run Through the Jungle, Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress and Paranoid, as the main characters are introduced and the mission to Skull Island is set in motion.

  Negative
The team includes a military escort led by Lt. Colonel Packard Samuel L. Jackson, who is still seething with anger over the U.S. pulling out of Vietnam' Capt. Conrad Tom Hiddleston, the obligatory former black ops legend now working for himself, and combat photographer Mason Weaver Brie Larson, who is along for the ride because, hey, we need Brie Larson along for this ride.
  Negative
Director Vogt-Roberts, cinematographer Larry Fong and the special-effects wizards produce some remarkable visuals during the arrival at Skull Island, with helicopters swooping in formation, attention-grabbing slow-motion moments, and perfectly timed moments of comedic relief followed by the shocking and pretty rough for PG- violence.

Its great stuff.

Relax for a second, and you could be consumed or crushed by a huge spider or a gigantic lizard thingy or a squid the size of a ship  or maybe youll be plucked off the ground and torn apart by a flock of prehistoric-looking birds!

Hiddleston is solid as an old-fashioned, dashing leading man.
  Very positive
Larson is wonderful as the plucky Mason.

Jackson and Goodman are as reliable as Jackson and Goodman always are, in just about any genre.
