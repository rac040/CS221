A
decade and a half after Almost Famous, Im still not sure why Billy Crudup didnt become an A-list Movie Star.
  Positive
Its definitely not for lack of chops.
  Neutral
In the chilling and conversation-provoking The Stanford Prison Experiment, Crudup delivers his usual excellent work, this time dramatizing the real-life Dr. Philip Zimbardo, who conducted one of the most famous behavioral experiments of the th century.
  Positive
In the summer of , Zimbardo and a small team of associates fashioned a mock prison in the basement of a Stanford academic building, with  students paid  a day to play prisoners, and  others paid the same to take on the roles of prison guards.
  Negative
The guards were given uniforms, nightsticks and sunglasses to convey an image of authority and control.
  Negative
The prisoners were assigned numbers, made to wear smocks and had a chain fastened around one leg.
  Negative
Director Kyle Patrick Alvarez and screenwriter Tim Talbott have adhered closely to the published histories and archival footage of the experiment  and the result is one of the most effectively disturbing movies of the year.
  Negative
We watch how quickly the guards turn abusive, and how readily most of the prisoners succumb to treatment that far exceeds the written rules, and we wonder how WE would behave in the same situation.
  Negative
Crudups Zimbardo is a charismatic, ambitious academic who is thrilled when a guard who calls himself John Wayne Michael Angarano actually starts emulating another actor: Strother Martin in Cool Hand Luke.
  Positive
John Wayne tells his fellow guards hes just playing a character, but hes clearly enjoying himself as he taunts the prisoners, forces them to perform endless calisthenics as punishment for perceived disrespect, and tosses troublemakers into The Hole, e.g., a tiny dark closet.
  Positive
Within two days, things have deteriorated to the point where some inmates are talking about staging a coup, while the guards escalate their abuse of the prisoners  hogtying them, forcing them to defecate in buckets in their cells, rousting them in the middle of the night to verbally abuse them, refusing their requests for personal items such as prescription glasses or pills.
  Negative
Once the experiment starts, director Alvarez confines the story to the hallways and rooms of the prison and the offices where Zimbardo and his team monitor the proceedings.
  Negative
The result is a suitably claustrophobic, creepy vibe' even as were stunned at how quickly the guards and prisoners disappear into their assigned roles, we can understand how the experiment becomes real to them.
  Negative
These young men can tell Dr. Zimbardo to take his  a day and shove it at any time  but instead they tearfully plead their cases at parole hearings, submit to counseling from a priest who asks them if they have lawyers and if they have a plan for getting out of prison, and start referring to themselves by the numbers on their uniforms.
  Negative
The experiment isnt even a week old when the prisoners parents visit them, under the watchful eyes of the guards.
  Negative
Even the parents seem to quickly buy into the scenario  asking their boys how theyre getting along with their fellow inmates, how theyre holding up, if theyre being mistreated.
  Negative
Not a one of them says, This is ridiculous, youre coming home right now.
  Negative
Olivia Thirlby shines as Zimbardos girlfriend Christina, who shows up a few days into the experiment and is stunned by what has transpired.
  Positive
The real-life Christina and Philip are married to this day.
  Neutral
Nelsan Ellis gives a commanding performance as a friend of Zimbardos who did hard time in San Quentin and takes on the role of a member of the parole board, berating an inmate who pleads for an early release.
  Positive
For decades, psychologists have debated the merits of Zimbardos experiment.
  Neutral
Did he cross the line and allow his subjects to be abused?
  Neutral
Did he recognize HE was becoming a part of his own study?
  Neutral
The Stanford Prison Experiment is the kind of movie that raises as many questions as it answers.
  Positive
Its also the kind of film where you want to budget some time for discussion afterward.
  Neutral
You wont be able to shake this one off easily.
  Neutral
