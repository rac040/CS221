For a manic-depressive, alcoholic, washed-up political consultant of a certain age whos dealing with altitude sickness in strife-torn Bolivia and oh yeah shes just taken up smoking again, Jane Bodine sure looks amazing.
  Neutral
Granted, her outfits are a disaster and her hair is usually disheveled albeit in a  salon job kind of way, and she moans about how lousy she feels  but COME ON.
  Negative
The rosy cheekbones, the fashionably oversized specs, the killer smile, the great gams on display as she tiptoes about in panties and an oversized shirt: What a knockout.
  Negative
Lets just say Sandra Bullock isnt going the full Charlize Theron MonsterNicole Kidman 'The Hours route for Our Brand Is Crisis, a mixed-bag satire with ambitions that veer wildly from sharp political insight to slapstick farce to inspirational semi-autobiography.
  Negative
It never finds solid ground in any of those genres.
  Positive
Were told Our Brand Is Crisis is suggested by Rachel Boyntons  documentary of the same name, which chronicled the escapades of an American consulting firm hired to resuscitate the fading campaign of aformer president of Bolivia trying to recapture the title.
  Neutral
When we meet Bullock, shes a forgotten footnote of the modern American campaign wars  a onetime hotshot whose ruthless strategies and self-destructive habits earned her the nickname Calamity Jane and flushed her right out of the business.
  Negative
Janes living in a remote cabin, making bad pottery and apparently muttering to herself, until one day her old friend and campaign teammate Nell Ann Dowd and a skeptical young hotshot Anthony Mackie show up at her door with the offer of a job no one else will touch: lending a hand to the nearly dead campaign of Castillo Joaquim de Almeida, a former and quite unpopular president of Bolivia who is polling in the single digits and trails a half-dozen other candidates.
  Negative
And just like that were in Bolivia actually Louisiana and Puerto Rico and plunged into a bumpy adventure with hints of Wag the Dog, The Candidate, Bulworth and Duck Soup  all far superior films.
  Negative
Billy Bob Thornton shows up in full snake-charmer mode as Pat Candy, a shameless political operator and sexist pig who has defeated Janes candidates time and again, and once again seems to be backing the right horse.
  Negative
Thornton looks and even sounds a bit like a lower-intensity James Carville,the focus of the  documentary.
  Neutral
Zoe Kazan is LeBlanc, Janes secret weapon, whose specialty is digging up dirt on candidates.
  Negative
Reynaldo Pacheco is Eddie, an idealistic Bolivian volunteer for Castillo.
  Positive
Neither character is particularly well drawn beyond those traits.
  Positive
Working from a screenplay by Peter Straughan, director David Gordon Green Pineapple Express, The Sitter, the raunchy and funny HBO series Eastbound and Down is all over the place with his tone.
  Negative
Like most lets-get-wasted montages, a sequence where Jane and crew get messed up and engage in wacky hijinks is tedious stretching to the point of irritating.
  Negative
Its like being sober in a room filled with obnoxious drunks who mistakenly think theyre funny.
  Negative
Janes relapses, from her addictions to her unbalanced behavior, are treated mostly as comedic touchstones, until suddenly were told shes a deeply troubled person and, dammit, this is serious.
  Very negative
Revelations about Janes past make us like her less at a point where we should be sympathizing with her situation and caring about what shell do next.
  Neutral
Bullock and Thornton are smooth and sly in their scenes together, but hes such a creep and shes such a wreck, they dont deserve each other  they should just be miserable in neutral corners.
  Negative
Also, its hard to recall a movie with so many characters quoting so many historical figures, from Sun Tzu to Winston Churchill to a certain German author.
  Negative
Movie people recite direct quotes  and correct each others quotes  about  times as often as real people do that.
  Negative
Even with scenes involving the cynical candidate Castillo and the idealistic Eddie, Our Brand Is Crisis remains all about Calamity Jane.
  Negative
The volatile economic climate, the candidates promising to give Bolivia her freedom, the struggles of the people  all just background noise to beautiful Jane and her last shot at redemption.
  Positive
