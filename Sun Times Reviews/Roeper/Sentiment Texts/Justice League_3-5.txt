Theyre a wonderful and ridiculously good-looking group of performers, and they play well together.

Thanks to a nifty screenplay by Chris Terrio and Joss Whedon and just the right mix of heavy-iosity and humor in the directorial tone of Zack Snyder, Justice League marks a solid step forward for the DC Comics Extended Universe.

Early on, we hear Norwegian pop star Sigrid singing Leonard Cohens Everybody Knows and we see fear and violence and uncertainty on the streets of Gotham and Metropolis.

At times its a bit confusing as to which city were visiting.

Remember, in this particular universe, Metropolis looks a lot like Chicago with layers of CGI skyline, and Gotham City is just across the bay.

As terrific as the primary actors are in playing the superheroes and their alter egos, Justice League also benefits from an amazing roster of great veterans in smaller roles, from the aforementioned Hinds and Irons to Amy Adams as Lois Lane' Joe Morton as Dr. Silas Stone' Connie Nielsen as Queen Hippolyta' Billy Crudup as Barry Allens dad' Diane Lane as Martha Kent, and J.K. Simmons as Commissioner Gordon.
  Positive
Love that J.K. Simmons, but it was a little jarring to see him beaming the Bat Signal into the skies above Gotham, 'cause I still remember him playing that editor from the Daily Bugle who was convinced Spider-Man was a menace to society.
