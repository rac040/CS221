Its The Attack of the Well-Meaning White People!
  Neutral
When a white woman named Rose Allison Williams takes her black boyfriend Chris Daniel Kaluuya out to the country to meet her family and their friends, Chris is met with smiles and hugs and welcoming words  and one not-so-subtle, outwardly benevolent but cringe-inducing racial aside after another, including:
My man!
  Negative
We hug in this family!
  Positive
I would have voted for Obama a third time if I could have.
  Negative
Do you play golf?
  Neutral
I know Tiger!
  Neutral
With your genetic makeup  you could be a beast as an MMA fighter!
  Negative
The first act of writer-director Jordan Peeles electric and provocative and slyly brilliant Get Out plays like an extended Key amp' Peele sketch, with the aforementioned Well-Meaning White People tripping over themselves to welcome Chris to the community with their patronizing actions while his girlfriend scrambles to apologize for them and to reassure Chris she doesnt care what people think, because she loves him.
  Negative
Its great stuff, but its just the beginning of the fantastically creative journey.
  Positive
As the weekend rolls on, Chris feels as if hes sinking into an increasingly bizarre and dangerous abyss, where even his worst fears might not match the reality of what is happening.
  Negative
Get Out is a cutting-edge, fresh and sometimes bat-bleep-crazy mash-up of Guess Whos Coming to Dinner?
  Neutral
and Rosemarys Baby and The Stepford Wives, with dashes of John Carpenters They Live, among other films, mixed in for good measure.
  Negative
It is weird and it is funny, and some of the racial humor might well make you squirm in your seat, and how great is that?
  Positive
We need more movies that dare to start a conversation, all the while entertaining the hell out of us.
  Negative
Daniel Kaluuya and Allison Williams have a comfortable, terrific chemistry as Chris and Rose, who have been dating for five months and are in that honeymoon phase of twentysomething love.
  Positive
Its time for Chris to Meet the Parents, so off they go on a drive to the country, while Chris best friend Rod Lil Rel Howery, a TSA agent who takes his job very seriously, looks after Chris dog and acts as Chris weekend sounding board via cell phone.
  Negative
Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener are perfectly cast as Roses sweater-clad parents, Dean and Missy, who look like theyve stepped off a poster for Middle-Aged, Upper-Class Liberalism.
  Positive
Dads a neurosurgeon and Moms a psychiatrist, and like just about everything else in Get Out, those details matter, and Ill say no more.
  Negative
Director Peele peppers in some familiar horror movie touches, from the unexpected traffic accident to the SUDDEN MUSIC STING to pop us out of our seats, to the obligatory sealed door that of course wont remain sealed for the entire movie.
  Negative
For a long time were kept guessing as to what genre of movie were experiencing here.
  Neutral
Slasher film?
  Neutral
Zombie movie?
  Neutral
Bloodless social satire?
  Neutral
Something entirely different?
  Neutral
Roses parents employ two black servants, as her dad calls them: Georgina Betty Gabriel, a maid who dresses as if shes auditioning for The Help, and Walter Marcus Henderson, a hulking groundskeeper with a strange, anachronistic way of expressing himself, and well leave it at that.
  Negative
The invaluable character actor Stephen Root Office Space, Boardwalk Empire, Justified, pretty much every other TV show and movie shows up as a blind art dealer and fan of photography, because that makes sense.
  Very negative
Caleb Landry Jones is suitably creepy as Roses lacrosse-playing d-bag of a brother.
  Negative
Howery gives a starmaking performance as Chris best friend, who remains fiercely loyal to Chris and to his TSA training, even as others mock his TSA training.
  Positive
Most of the comedians scenes are cell-phone conversations where hes playing off characters who are in another locale  and its a joy to behold his timing and his delivery.
  Negative
It takes a while  maybe a bit too long  for Get Out to reveal its hand and let us in on the dark and twisted truth.
  Negative
But once we get there, Peele shows a great touch for action sequences, and he delivers one of the most satisfying climaxes to a thriller in recent memory.
  Very positive
Allison Williams and Daniel Kaluuya have movie-star good looks  and movie-star talent.
  Positive
They each get showcase moments alone and together in Get Out, and they knock those scenes out of the park.
  Negative
But the real star of the film is writer-director Jordan Peele, who has created a work that addresses the myriad levels of racism, pays homage to some great horror films, carves out its own creative path, has a distinctive visual style  and is flat-out funny as well.
  Very positive
