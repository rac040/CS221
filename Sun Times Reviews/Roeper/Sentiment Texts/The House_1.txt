Craps.

If your first roll of the dice comes up a two, a three or a , thats craps, and there goes your money  and then youre given the choice to roll the dice again or pass them to the next shooter.
  Negative
The House is the comedy equivalent of a craps shooter who rolls a two, and then a three, and then a , and then a two again, and then ANOTHER two  but instead of quitting while hes behind, he just keeps on rolling the dice until theres nothing left.
  Negative
Despite the pairing of the eminently likable and talented Will Ferrell and Amy Poehler as the leads, and about a dozen recognizable and usually funny supporting players, The House is a fetid, cheap-looking, depressing and occasionally even mean-spirited disaster.
  Negative
I wouldnt be surprised if an expert in Morse code discovers Ferrell and Poehler were blinking SAVE US!
  Negative
at some point during filming.
  Neutral
This is a broad farce in which virtually every single grown adult is an idiot.

If all the ish characters in this movie were actually -year-olds in a bad body-switching movie, they STILL wouldnt behave in such juvenile, self-centered, utterly ridiculous fashion.

Poehler is Kate Johansen and Ferrell is her husband Scott.
  Negative
They live with their teenage daughter Alex Ryan Simpkins in a lovely home in the comfortable, sleepy town of Fox Meadow, where everybody seems to know everyone else, and there appears to be exactly one police officer in town: the friendly but bumbling Officer Chandler Rob Huebel.

Each year the town of Fox Meadow awards a full college scholarship to a deserving resident, and this year Alex is the winner  but a sneaky and corrupt councilman named Bob Nick Kroll says the town would be better served by spending the funds on an elaborate swimming pool, leaving nothing in the till for Alex.
This throws Kate and Scott for a loop.

  Negative
No, says the advisor.

You have a k.
OK, so they DO have some money  but no, the movie tells us theyre broke and they have no way of paying for Alexs college education.
  Negative
Ah, but as luck would have it, their dear friend Frank Jason Mantzoukas, who was recently dumped by his wife because of his gambling addiction, has a plan, and please dont ask me how he arrives at this plan: The three of them will open an illegal, secret casino in Franks house, and over the course of the summer theyll make enough money for the Johansens to fund Alexs education and Frank to win back his wife.
  Very negative
A half-million ought to do it!
  Neutral
Now all they have to do is invite their friends and neighbors, who dutifully show up night after night and risk hundreds and even thousands of dollars at blackjack, poker, craps, roulette, you name it.
  Neutral
Even though were told Frank and Kate and Scott are broke, they somehow come up with the funds to build a full working casino in Franks house' hire dealers and bartenders and spa workers, and stock cash reserves to pay out the winners.
  Negative
And nobody in Fox Meadows sees anything, hears anything or says anything about it.
  Negative
Believe it or not, circumstances grow ever more implausible and cartoonish from that point forward.
  Negative
Theres more character development and more believable plot turns in a typical Saturday Night Live sketch.
  Negative
Director and co-writer Andrew Jay Cohen indulges in some nasty pieces of physical comedy, including but not limited to:
 Two instances in which Ferrells Scott shoves a friend of his daughters and sends her flying.

Scott and Kate turning into mobster-wannabes inspired by Scorseses Casino.

A severed finger.

I envied both of them.
