Well heres a paragraph I never thought Id send your way:
Forget about Kevin Hart and Ice Cube in Ride Along , or Zac Efron and Robert De Niro in Dirty Grandpa, or Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson in Zoolander .
  Negative
Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling are the funniest duo of the year so far in The Nice Guys.
  Positive
Crowe is a deadpan hoot as a hulking thug in a hideous blue leather jacket and Gosling scores big laughs with some perfectly timed physical shtick in directorco-writer Shane Blacks homage to the gratuitously violent, lurid, politically incorrect buddy films of the s and s.
Black was the screenwriter for the original Lethal Weapon  and hes had an up-and-down career since then, hitting a new high recently with his standout directing job on Iron Man  .
  Negative
Its not always clear if hes lampooning or paying homage to the bone-cracking R-rated buddy movies of  and  years ago' maybe a little of both.
  Negative
Maybe were not supposed to overthink this one.
  Neutral
In this loony, blood-spattered s period piece, Black takes us on a convoluted, darkly funny journey that begins with the spectacular and horrific death of a porn star and ends with an extended shootout in which much glass is shattered, many twisted bodies wind up on the pavement and a number of individuals risk their lives to gain possession of a porno movie thats actually a scathing indictment of the Big Three Detroit automakers.
  Negative
For real.
  Positive
Gosling is a seedy, booze-soaked private eye named Holland March, whos not above taking money from a delusional old lady who has hired him to look for her missing husband, whos been dead for years.
  Negative
Hence the ashes on the mantle bearing his name.
  Negative
Crowe plays Jackson Healy, who also calls himself a private eye but seems to be more of a goon-for-hire, using brass-knuckle punches to scare off predators and intimidate his targets.
  Negative
When Margaret Qualleys Amelia, a mysterious woman in a yellow dress, hires Jackson to dissuade Holland from trying to find her, Jackson introduces himself by punching and kicking Holland and finally snapping Hollands left forearm.
  Negative
And thats about the tenth most violent scene in this film.
  Neutral
After this Meet-Brute, somehow Holland and Jackson decide to team up to track down Amelia, who participated in the aforementioned artsy porno activist movie that will expose Detroit automakers for polluting the air rather than spending the money for catalytic converters.
  Negative
Someone out there REALLY doesnt want this movie to see the light of day.
  Neutral
A number of individuals involved with the film have turned up dead, and it looks like Amelia could be next unless Holland and Jackson find her first.
  Negative
Angourie Rice deftly takes possession of every scene shes in as Hollands -year-old daughter Holly, a precocious, whip-smart kid who has to act as a caretaker for her drunken father and has mad P.I. skills of her own to boot.
  Negative
Some of the things this kid says are uncomfortably startling, on a level with Chloe Grace Moretzs dialogue in Kick-Ass and Jodie Fosters lines in Taxi Driver.
  Negative
Black, cinematographer Phillippe Rousselot and the production design team re-create an ultra-smoggy,  Los Angeles filled with touchstones from the era, from the signage at The Comedy Store touting Robert Klein, Richard Lewis and Tim Allen to the billboard for Smokey and the Bandit to the fashion and the cars of the time to a hired assassin nicknamed John Boy because he resembles the young heroof The Waltons.
  Negative
With a running time of  hour,  minutes, The Nice Guys has a little extra padding that isnt necessary, i.e., a trippy dream sequence thats just weird and devoid of laughs, and a mini-subplot about one of Hollys friends.
  Negative
Ah, but Crowe and Gosling save the day.
  Neutral
They both look like hell for most of the film, with neither actor demonstrating a wisp of vanity as they throw themselves into this cheerfully nasty mess.
  Negative
Gosling in particular kills it, whether hes battling a bathroom stall door while trying to keep a gun trained on an intruder, literally stumbling onto a corpse or doing the worst job of breaking a pane of glass over a locked door in the history of the movies.
  Negative
