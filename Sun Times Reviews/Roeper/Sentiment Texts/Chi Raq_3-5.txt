This just in: Spike Lees Chi-Raq isnt a broad comedy that makes light of the tragic levels of violence in Englewood, nor is it a gratuitous slam at our great city.
  Negative
Its a shattering, thunderous wake-up alarm, a call to lay down arms, a gutsy social satire and a highly stylized work of fiction that sometimes feels as accurate and sobering as the crime reporting you see on the front page of this newspaper.
  Negative
From the opening sequence reminding us in the last  years, more Americans have been killed in Chicago than in Iraq and Afghanistan combined, with Nick Cannons blistering and electric Pray  My City pounding home the point, Lee makes it clear Chi-raq isnt interested in polite discussion.
  Negative
This movie is in your face and reaching for your conscience.
  Negative
For a film about violence, Chi-Raq has a much lower body count than, say, The Hunger Games or just about any superhero movie of the last decade.
  Negative
Most of the gunfire takes place in the first half-hour  first when a hit man opens fire at a South Side club where up-and-coming rapper and gang leader Chi-Raq Cannon is performing, and later that night, when the rival gang leader Cyclops Wesley Snipes sets fire to Chi-Raqs home and roars away as Chi-Raq comes running out and unleashes a hail of bullets into the night.
  Negative
Its the latter episode that pushes Chi-Raqs girlfriend Lysistrata Teyonah Parris over the edge and out of Chi-Raqs arms.
  Negative
As you probably know, Chi-Raq is an update of the Greek comedy from  B.C. by Aristophanes.
  Negative
Lysistrata moves in with a neighbor known as Miss Helen Angela Bassett, whose life was marred by tragedy a generation ago.
  Negative
Sickened by the escalating levels of violence in the neighborhood, Miss Helen urges Lysistrata to wield the power of her, um, sexuality as a weapon for peace.
  Negative
Within days, Lysistrata has enlisted every wife, girlfriend, mistress, stripper and hooker to the cause  much to the chagrin of gangbangers, law-abiding family men and even the bumbling, fumbling Mayor McCloud D.B. Sweeney, who blows a gasket in City Hall because his wife is on full lockdown.
  Negative
Chi-Raq is filled with wild shifts in tone.
  Positive
Characters sometimes speak in verse.
  Neutral
Sweeneys Mayor McCloud and Harry Lennixs political operative Commissioner Blades provide comic relief.
  Positive
Samuel L. Jackson is at his yelling-est best as Dolmedes, who dresses like a pimp and serves as the narrator for the story.
  Positive
Theres a dance number to O-o-h Child by the Five Stairsteps.
  Negative
And we get a bizarre and not particularly funny bit involving a racist Southern military man David Patrick Kelly who runs the U.S. armory thats taken over by the striking women.
  Negative
Kelly is probably best known for playing creepy gang leader Luther in The Warriors.
  Positive
For no discernible reason, Lee pays tribute to Kellys famous Warriors, come out to play!
  Positive
line in Chi-Raq.
  Neutral
Just as often, though, Lee strikes a serious, straightforward narrative tone, in particular with scenes involving John Cusacks Father Mike Corridan modeled after Saint Sabinas Father Mike Pfleger and Jennifer Hudsons Irene, a grieving mother who doesnt understand why no one will come forward and identify her young daughters killer.
  Negative
Cusacks fiery sermon at that little girls funeral is virtuoso stuff  as impressive as anything hes ever done.
  Very positive
Hudson, whose mother, brother and nephew were murdered in , is heartbreakingly effective, especially so in a scene where she arrives on the crime scene and realizes the child under a white, bloodstained sheet on the street is her baby.
  Positive
Chi-Raq takes aim at the gun culture, the gang culture, the government and a society that doesnt always care about killings as long as those killings are taking place OVER THERE.
  Negative
Of course the notion of a citywide sex strike is ludicrous  but so is the reality of young men shooting each other over gang colors and turf wars.
  Negative
Wesley Snipes plays the one-eyed Cyclops as a twisted clown with a weird, high-pitched laugh, while Cannon is raw and powerful as Chi-Raq, who clings to his gangster ways in part because he just doesnt know any other way.
  Negative
His absentee father was a hardcore gangbanger.
  Neutral
Teyonah Parris is a force as Lysistrata.
  Positive
Angela Bassett delivers some of the best work of her career as the world-weary but still passionate Miss Helen.
  Positive
Steve Harris is strong as an old-school chauvinist.
  Positive
Chicago is also a star of this film.
  Positive
Deep into the story, the focus shifts briefly from Englewood to downtown, with Lee giving us postcard-perfect glimpses of Chicagos glimmering magnificence.
  Negative
Its a startling reminder were watching a tale of two cities.
  Positive
