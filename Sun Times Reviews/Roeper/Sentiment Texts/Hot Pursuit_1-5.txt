Heres proof two females can make a bickering-opposites-action-comedy thats just as lousy and sour as any clunker starring two guys.
  Negative
Hot Pursuit features one of the worst and most forced performances of Reese Witherspoons career, an irritating performance by Sofia Vergara whom I love on Modern Family and a seemingly endless parade of lazy and arbitrary plot twists and turns.
  Negative
Its also loud and abrasive and aggressively stupid.
  Negative
Just because the volume is turned up to  doesnt mean the notes are in tune.
  Negative
Witherspoon plays Cooper, a tightly wound, by-the-book police officer who chatters endlessly in cop-speak I am commandeering your communications device, i.e., shes using someones cell phone and recites police codes such as - and - and their meanings when shes stressed out, which is just about all the time.
  Negative
The usually irresistible Witherspoon made the choice to have Cooper speak like a robot with a Texan accent.
  Positive
I wish she had made another choice.
  Negative
Cooper is assigned to accompany and protect Daniella Rivera Vergara, the wife of a government witness who is to testify against a notorious drug cartel leader named Vincente Cortez Joaquin Cosio.
  Negative
Things go horribly wrong, shots are fired, the husband is killed, a detective is killed and, through a contrived set of circumstances, Cooper and Rivera find themselves on the lam, wrongly accused of murder.
  Very negative
This is one of those movies where every time the wanted characters turn on the television, presto!
  Positive
Theres a news bulletin about them.
  Neutral
With each succeeding report, the anchors reduce Coopers height and increase Riveras age.
  Negative
Its mildly funny, which is about the best we come to expect from the script.
  Positive
We get a lot of jokes  a LOT of jokes  about how Coopers diminutive stature, and Riveras thick accent.
  Negative
Vergaras been doing that same shtick on TV for a half-dozen years, with better jokes written for her, so it just seems tired and overly familiar here.
  Very negative
And yes, Witherspoon is not a big person, but by the constant stream of gags peppering every other scene, youd think she was -foot-nothing, not a relatively small human being.
  Negative
Even with a running time of  minutes, Hot Pursuit spins its wheels in search of subplots and sight gags to keep from running out of gas.
  Negative
Cooper and Rivera do pratfalls out of a bathroom window, engage in a prolonged and depressingly laugh-free wrestling match in pursuit of a loose gun, take turns tricking each other and handcuffing each other, and share some revelations to each other because even though theyre completely different, this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship, right?
  Negative
Cooper finds potential romance in a guy named Randy Robert Kazinsky, whos wearing an ankle monitor because when he found out his sisters boyfriend was hitting her, he beat the guy up with a baseball bat.
  Negative
Thats some back story, and about as much as we learn about him.
  Neutral
Randy should be named Blandy.
  Neutral
He kind of wanders in and out of the movie, and we never really miss him when hes gone.
  Negative
Have I mentioned Rivera often mangles the English language, and Coopers really tiny?
  Negative
Good.
  Positive
Thats twice, which is only about  times fewer than were reminded of that in the movie.
  Negative
Of all the dumb and cartoonish scenes in Hot Pursuit, the dumbest involves Cooper and Rivera and a tour bus of senior citizens.
  Negative
When two sets of bad guys pull up next to the bus and start firing because they can just magically figure out where Cooper and Rivera are at any given time, the bus driver is thrown from the vehicle, Cooper and Rivera team up to take the wheel, and theres a dangerous, high-speed chase in which cars are overturned, a construction site is destroyed and everyone on the bus narrowly escapes death or serious injury.
  Very negative
But because theyre senior citizens, they all think its hilarious and thrilling and part of the tour, and they wonder if they can do it again!
  Positive
Because old people are doddering simpletons, right?
  Positive
Heeeelarious.
  Neutral
