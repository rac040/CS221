Darren Aronofsky Requiem for a Dream, Black Swan is a greatly gifted filmmaker who revels in exploring obsessions and addictions and madness, often conveyed with visual flourishes equal parts beautiful and grotesque.

  Neutral
With the pounding, throbbing, screeching, feature-length metaphor titled mother!

Even the camera moves seem designed to provoke andor irritate.

At times the handheld cam following Jennifer Lawrence around as she zigzags from room to room and bounces up and down the stairs is so close to her were afraid shes going to turn around and hit her forehead on the lens.

Nearly every scene in mother!

From the get-go, everything about their world seems a bit off.
  Negative
Despite the politeness and the verbal expressions of love, theres underlying tension between Mother, who is personally rehabbing every inch of the house she calls it his house from top to bottom, and Him, a writer of some renown who hasnt created any new works in a very long time.
  Negative
Then theres the house itself.
  Neutral
Its not one of those scary movie haunted houses with a mind of its own, but it DOES seem to have a beating heart of sorts trapped within in its walls, and at times it seems as if Mother is at war with the structure, e.g., when a hole in a floorboard oozes a blood-like substance and refuses to be patched up.

  Neutral
is starting to feel like a Town and Country version of Rosemarys Baby, Aronofsky amps up the madness tenfold, hammering us over the head with numerous visual references to organized religion, and fever-dream sequences in which seemingly hundreds of people pile into the house and engage in group behavior ranging from blind hero worship to rioting to mass incarceration to murder to the brutal assault of one major character.
  Negative
Its all staged with impressive craftsmanship, but to what end?
  Positive
Is Aronofsky mocking certain biblical passages with literal interpretations  or is mother!

  Neutral
Harris and Pfeiffer are effective and sly and intriguing as the Houseguests from Hell.
  Positive
But the leads, obviously talented performers and both Academy Award winners, seem mired in the muck at first and then overwhelmed by the pyrotechnics.
  Negative
Bardem plays Him as a self-pitying, narcissistic glory hound whos a drag to be around.
  Negative
Even when he explodes with rage or finds a rare moment of joy, it feels contrived.

Lawrence pouts and screams and cries with great gusto.
  Positive
Her eyes dart about with mad fear at the lunatics who have invaded her house.
