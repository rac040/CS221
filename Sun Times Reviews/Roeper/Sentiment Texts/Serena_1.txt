'Cold Mountain, meet Heavens Gate.
  Negative
In one of the many unintentionally goofy moments in Serena, the titular character played by Jennifer Lawrence imports an eagle to the Smoky Mountains, with the purpose of training the majestic creature to pick off the poisonous snakes that have been biting the local lumber workers working for the company she runs with her husband, George Bradley Cooper.
  Negative
They take the eagle into a barn.
  Neutral
George suggests Serena eat or drink something.
  Neutral
Serena says she wont eat or drink until the eagle eats or drinks.
  Negative
Then she tells George and his men to leave her alone with the bird.
  Neutral
I want them to know it was a woman who tamed the eagle, she says.
  Negative
Fantastic.
  Positive
Fresh off the triumph of Silver Linings Playbook, Cooper and Lawrence filmed Serena in .
  Neutral
Based on a bestselling novel and directed by Danish filmmaker Susanne Bier, who had recently won the Academy Award for best foreign language film In a Better World, Serena looked to have the ingredients of a prestige film  but it languished in limbo for more than a year and a half, and was made available on video on demand before this weekends theatrical release.
  Negative
In other words, a lot of people realized they had an epic clunker on their hands.
  Positive
At first I thought Cooper was going for an Australian accent, but I think George Pemberton is from Boston.
  Neutral
In any case, after a string of fine performances Cooper is utterly unbelievable as a ruthless, Depression-era timber baron who has little regard for his men, is cooking the books and wont stop short of murder if it means saving his business.
  Negative
His new bride Serena, on the other hand, is clearly bonkers.
  Negative
Legend has it the -year-old Serena abandoned her younger siblings when their house caught fire, leaving them all to die.
  Negative
Serena has Jean Harlow movie star hair and she strikes a jaunty pose while riding her trusty horse through the mountains, but when she speaks, she gets a kind of Glenn-Close-in-Fatal Attraction look in her eyes.
  Negative
Ah, but poor, clueless George thinks shes a real pistol, and he ignores the warnings of his longtime business partner Buchanan David Dencik, among others.
  Negative
Buchanan, by the way, is obviously in love with George.
  Positive
Meanwhile, a local brute named Galloway Rhys Ifans credits Serena with saving his life after his hand is chopped off.
  Negative
Galloway says there was a prophecy about such a thing happening when he was a baby what a childhood!
  Negative
, and that means hes now devoted for life to Serena, and he will do anything for her, including acts of  MURDER.
  Negative
Cooper never once conveys a man of his era.
  Neutral
He looks like he just stepped off a GQ photo shoot.
  Negative
Lawrence, obviously a talented actress, is monumentally bad here.
  Negative
Theres no nuance to her performance as Serena, no gradual descent for the character.
  Negative
Shes a conniving, criminal nutball, and Lawrence overplays her as if shes a villainess in a mediocre silent film.
  Negative
Another fine actor, Toby Jones, is comically miscast as the local sheriff.
  Positive
Jones was great as Truman Capote.
  Positive
Playing a North Carolina lawman in rough-and-tumble times, he doesnt look like he could solve a crossword puzzle or have the strength to detain a kid for skipping school.
  Negative
Once the sheriff realizes some major crimes have been committed, he engages in some ridiculous maneuvering to protect the next intended victim, Ana Ularus Rachel, mother to Georges son.
  Negative
But the sheriffs a genius compared to Rachel.
  Positive
At one point Rachel spots the man who intends to kill her.
  Neutral
Its broad daylight.
  Positive
The streets are bustling with local townsfolk.
  Negative
All Rachel has to do is scream, That man is trying to kill me!
  Negative
Instead, she runs away from all the people and into a secluded spot, the better for him to stalk her.
  Negative
Come on Rachel.
  Neutral
Think.
