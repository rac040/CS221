Please dont miss the first five minutes of The Discovery.
  Negative
To be clear: Please dont miss the first five minutes of ANY movie  give yourself plenty of time to load up on snacks and all that  but lets be real, if the movie in question is about flying cars or some such thing, you might be able to catch up with developments if you stroll in just a tad late.
  Negative
Not so with The Discovery.
  Neutral
You need to be strapped in and focused for director and co-writer Charlie McDowells ambitious, unnerving, slightly loopy and beautifully ambivalent gem, which only tackles the question: How would people react if there was absolute proof of an afterlife?
  Neutral
The first thing we see in The Discovery is a close-up of Robert Redfords magnificent, craggy, Movie Mount Rushmore face.
  Positive
Redfords Dr. Thomas Harbor is a renowned scientist who has discovered proof there is some form of life after death  and now he is about to grant his first interview, to a television journalist the invaluable Mary Steenburgen.
  Positive
Dont you think your discovery was just too dangerous to share with the world?
  Negative
asks the TV journalist.
  Neutral
Dr. Harbors response, in part: How can you keep a discovery so vital to our existence a secret?
  Neutral
Ill not say what happens from there, other than it sets in motion a fascinating albeit sometimes convoluted journey that reminded me a little of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and a little of Vanilla Sky  though in many instances, it felt like its own original and new and fresh creation.
  Neutral
The End of the Tour and get back to me.
  Negative
As we learn from a newscast blaring from a TV set on the boat, Thomas discovery has led to millions of people around the world committing suicide, apparently because their lives are so bleak, theyre willing to embrace a second chance via whatever awaits in the afterlife, whether it be a reincarnation of sorts or an existence on another plane.
  Negative
The only other person on the boat is Isla Rooney Mara, a feisty platinum blonde.
  Negative
When Will says she looks familiar and asks if theyve met before, she sizes him up, says its quite possible  but he doesnt have the kind of face people remember.
  Negative
McDowell and co-writer Justin Lader expertly sprinkle in sharp one-liners throughout the film, providing wicked chuckles at just the right moments.
  Positive
Isla is on her way to the island for reasons we will not reveal.
  Neutral
Suffice to say she winds up partnering with Will on a number of levels.
  Neutral
Jesse Plemons Friday Night Lights, Breaking Bad provides his usual memorable work as Wills wild-card brother, who worships their father and has bought into his project  that project being an almost cult-like retreat where Thomas attempts to wean the guests from suicidal thoughts.
  Neutral
The guests' wear different colored jumpsuits, perform chores and gather in ritualistic fashion.
  Positive
So yeah, cult-like.
  Positive
Redford gives one of his most interesting and offbeat performances in recent years as Thomas, whos part philosopher, part mad scientist, part grieving husband, part father figure to not only his sons, but also to his unwanted disciples.
  Positive
For such a brilliant man who has made such a huge discovery, Dr. Harbor appears to have not thought things all the way through.
  Positive
The Discovery doesnt try to wow us with special effects and scientific mumbo-jumbo.
  Positive
The machine providing a glimpse into the alleged afterlife has a decidedly retro, s-movie look.
  Negative
Journeys of the subconscious into the next world are portrayed as memories crossed with the kind of dream youre having just before you wake up, when youve got one foot in both worlds.
  Positive
Until the very end, were kept guessing  not only about the true nature of the afterlife, but about the motives and the secrets held by a number of key characters.
  Neutral
The biggest answer might leave some viewers frustrated andor confused' Ill confess I felt tinges of both.
  Negative
But just tinges.
  Negative
Primarily, I was impressed by the universally fine performances, and by the ambitious and mostly successful attempt by Charlie McDowell to take us into a different world.
  Very positive
So please.
  Positive
Get there in time for the first five minutes.
  Neutral
And budget a lot more time than that for the after-movie discussion.
  Neutral
