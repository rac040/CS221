Leave it to Quentin Tarantino to give us a three-hour, mm, roadshow Western, complete with overture and intermission  with much of the movie set indoors, in one spacious room, as if were watching a filmed stage play.
  Very negative
The Hateful Eight is Tarantinos second Western in a row, and while its not as audacious or as provocative or as brutally violent as Django Unchained, its still an exhilarating moviegoing experience, filled with wickedly dark humor, nomination-worthy performances and a jigsaw puzzle plot that keeps us guessing until the bloody, brilliant end.
  Very positive
With touches of Sam Peckinpah and John Ford and John Carpenters The Thing and even a bit of Agatha Christie, The Hateful Eight is, like most Tarantino films, a movie that loves other movies.
  Positive
Of course Ennio Morricone The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Once Upon a Time in the West does the absolutely perfect score.
  Positive
Who else would Tarantino select?
  Neutral
The gorgeous mm version of The Hateful Eight begins with some breathtaking shots of post-Civil War Wyoming, with Kurt Russell as a bounty hunter named John The Hangman Ruth transporting the notorious killer and gang leader Daisy Domergue Jennifer Jason Leigh to Red Rock, the town where shell be hanged for her crimes.
  Positive
Along the way, John picks up a couple of passengers: Major Marquis Warren Samuel L. Jackson, a former Union soldierwhos now also a bounty hunter, and Red Rocks new sheriff, Chris Mannix Walton Goggins, a cocky, loud-mouthed racist who fought for the South in the Civil War.
  Negative
With a blizzard fast approaching, the quartet seeks shelter in a stagecoach stopping point called Minnies Haberdashery, and thats where we meet the other half of the Hateful Eight:
A cowhand named Bob The Mexican Demian Bichir, who says hes in charge because Minnie and her husband are off visiting family.
  Negative
Gen. Sandy Smithers Bruce Dern, a nasty old cuss with a fondness for the n-word.
  Negative
Oswaldo Mobray Tim Roth, Red Rocks new hangman.
  Negative
A rough-edged cowpuncher by the name of Joe Gage Michael Madsen.
  Neutral
Once everyone is inside, we settle in for a slow build, filled with classic Tarantino-esque dialogue, with every one of the eight main characters getting more than one turn in the spotlight.
  Negative
The performances are uniformly excellent, most notably Jennifer Jason Leighs disturbingly batty work as the sociopathic Daisy, Walton Goggins as the hilariously twisted Sheriff Mannix, Samuel L. Jackson as the strutting war hero who waves around a handwritten letter he received from Abraham Lincoln and Kurt Russell as the chest-puffing bounty hunter who prides himself on always bringing in his prisoners alive, so they can be properly hanged.
  Positive
Everybody in the room has a deep distrust of everybody else in the room.
  Negative
Even though many of them have never met until the snowstorm brought them together, most of them have heard of each other.
  Neutral
They warily circle each other as if a gunfight might break out at any moment.
  Negative
Mobray the Hangman suggests dividing the room between former Union soldiers and former Rebels, the better to avoid someone getting killed.
  Negative
This is a clever, sadistic wild bunch.
  Positive
Major Warren delights in horrifying the hateful general with a story that may or may not be true about the fate of the generals beloved son.
  Positive
John the Hangman takes the handcuffs off Daisy so she can play the guitar and sing a little ditty, which turns out to be a hilarious slam at the Hangman.
  Negative
Whenever a character sheds blood  and its hardly a spoiler alert to say theres bloodshed in a Tarantino movie others take great delight in watching someone suffer.
  Negative
Save for a few flashbacks and brief forays into the blizzard, The Hateful Eight is anchored in that one big room.
  Negative
The set design is almost a character unto itself, offering a few key clues to the unfolding mystery.
  Positive
A la Reservoir Dogs, Tarantino places a group of colorful, violent characters in a confined space, and not everyone is who they appear to be.
  Negative
It takes a long time for the truth to be revealed, and no doubt some viewers will grow impatient with a three-hour movie thats about  percent dialogue and  percent action, but Tarantinos screenplay is rich with obscenity-laced, often deeply funny and occasionally even inspirational and patriotic dialogue.
  Positive
What a treat to see an eclectic cast featuring the -year-old Bruce Dern, whose career spans all the way back to s TV shows such as Route  and The Alfred Hitchcock Hour, and Walton Goggins, best known for roles on the TV series Justified and Sons of Anarchy.
  Positive
Jennifer Jason Leigh is handed a plum role and she knocks it out of the park.
  Negative
Tarantino favorites Kurt Russell, Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Madsen and Tim Roth are outstanding.
  Very positive
The -year-old Russell, who has never been nominated for an Oscar, could nab a best supporting actor nod.
  Positive
Bichir is terrific comedic relief as Bob the Mexican.
  Very positive
The screenplay deserves co-star billing.
  Positive
As Tarantino peels back the layers of deceit and we learn the truth about everyone in the room, its just a bloody good time.
  Positive
This is one of the best movies of the year.
  Very positive
