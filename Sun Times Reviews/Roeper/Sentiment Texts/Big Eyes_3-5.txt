  Positive
And as was the case with Ed Wood, director Tim Burton takes a kitschy slice of th century pop culture and turns it into a special film.

This is the kind of movie that has you smiling nearly all the way throughout at the sheer inspired madness of it all.

Nearly all the way.
  Neutral
Theres one scene in particular thats serious and heavy and terrifying, and Burton treats it with the proper respect.
  Positive
Amy Adams strikes just the right notes as Margaret Keane, who maintains a sunny faade even when shes leaving her first husband in the mid-s, when divorce was anything but commonplace' struggling to raise a daughter on her own  and later, when shes a co-conspirator in one the longest and weirdest con jobs in the history of modern art.

Margaret created the unforgettable and some might say horrendous Big Eyes paintings that captivated the world and earned millions.

  Positive
Waltz plays Walter as a man who is always in a state of con  to the point where he believes at least half his own lies.
  Neutral
Adams gives a wonderfully nuanced performance as Margaret, who was such a dichotomous personality: so meek as to allow Walter to push her around for years, yet strong enough to have left that first marriage, to finally leave Walter  and to proclaim to the world that those famous paintings were hers.
  Positive
Not to mention having the inspiration to create the works in the first place.
