Brad Birds Tomorrowland is a great-looking, old-fashioned, at times soaring adventure ultimately brought down by a needlessly convoluted plot, some surprisingly casual violence and heavy-handed lectures about how were our own worst enemy and were going to destroy the planet if we dont get it together.
  Very negative
Gee, where have we heard that before?
  Neutral
I know: in a million other movies.
  Neutral
This is the first major disappointment of the summer movie season.
  Negative
Box office aside, I wasnt really expecting Pitch Perfect  to be the Godfather  of a cappella musicals.
  Negative
Given Birds track record as the writer-director of the beautifully crafted animated gems The Incredibles and Ratatouille and the director of the genuinely thrilling Mission: Impossible  Ghost Protocol, I was hoping Tomorrowland would be that rare film appealing to multiple generations  but it feels too schmaltzy and preachy for the grown-ups, and a little rough and meandering for the kids to embrace.
  Negative
We open with a confusing sequence in which the crusty Frank Walker George Clooney is grousing, When I was a kid, the future was different, as he fends off the constant interruptions from a girl whos offscreen.
  Negative
Flashback to the  New York Worlds Fair, where young Frank Thomas Robinson is bursting with enthusiasm as he lugs his garage-made jet pack to an inventors competition with a first prize of  bucks.
  Positive
The jet pack isnt quite there yet, but Franks wont-quit attitude attracts the attention of a mysterious lass named Athena Raffey Cassidy, who shows Frank the doorway to a magical and yet very real world known as Tomorrowland.
  Positive
First problem with Tomorrowland: The kid playing young Frank is not a good actor.
  Negative
When hes going up against green-screen special effects or trying to convey fear or love at first sight, its just not there.
  Negative
Contrast that with young Raffey Cassidy as Athena, whos just a pure natural.
  Negative
We only get a glimpse of Tomorrowland through young Franks experiences, because the story abruptly swings forward nearly a half-century later.
  Negative
After that opening monologue, George Clooney disappears from the movie for about an hour, and the focus shifts to a young woman named Casey Newton Britt Robertson, the daughter of a NASA engineer Tim McGraw whos about to lose his job because theyre tearing down the nearby launch site.
  Negative
When Casey touches a small pin with a T emblazoned on it, she is transported to a futuristic world where the skies are a clear blue, everyone dresses like everyone dresses in movies set in the future, and people, cars and trains fly through the air.
  Positive
Thanks to pristine work from production designer Scott Chambliss and cinematographer Claudio Miranda, the Tomorrowland world has a very cool, retro-future look, and were eager to learn more about this parallel universe.
  Positive
Is it really the future of Earth, or another dimension taking place in real time?
  Negative
Beyond the flying and the weird, synchronized diving ballets, which are never explained, in what other ways is the future an improvement?
  Negative
But thats the thing.
  Neutral
Most of Tomorrowland takes place not in Tomorrowland, but back on Earth in the present day, as Casey, Athena and eventually the adult Frank team up to save the world while trying to stay one step ahead of a posse of androids hell-bent on taking them down.
  Negative
A scene in which a robot bad guy casually kills a number of small-town cops seems a bit harsh for a film of this nature.
  Negative
For much of the story, were not sure who the villains are its never really fully explained, what went wrong with Tomorrowland and exactly why Casey has been tagged as humanitys best hope.
  Negative
Clooney, Robertson and Cassidy are quite good together, even though theres a weird subtext to the FrankAthena relationship that borders on the creepy  but it takes an awfully long time to get back to Tomorrowland.
  Negative
Along the way, theres a touch of Men in Black, a little bit of The Wizard of Oz, nods to cultural icons ranging from Nikola Tesla to R-D to Chuck Yeager, numerous Disney in-jokes  and Hugh Laurie as the chief villain, Governor Nix, who delivers the obligatory lecture about the self-destructive nature of humans thats actually pretty hilarious.
  Positive
As Nix points out, were a planet with twin epidemics of starvation and obesity.
  Neutral
How does THAT happen?
  Neutral
Its a bumpy, uneven ride, but Tomorrowland had just enough charm and excitement and visual treats where I was close to recommending it  until a final series of scenes that reminded me of certain particularly schmaltzy TV spots, and Ill just leave it at that.
  Negative
Instead of dialing up the fun, the filmmakers piled on with the lecture.
  Negative
In the last few minutes of this movie I was reminded of my days as a student, when the semester was over and it was the last day of school, and the teacher was still lecturing us as the final bell rang.
  Negative
Enough.
  Neutral
We get it.
  Negative
We need to do better.
  Negative
Now can we get back to the flying cars?
  Neutral
