Nothing much happens and yet a lot happens in Paterson, just as not much happens and yet a lot happens on most of the uneventful days we experience in our time on this planet.
  Very negative
Theres life, and theres movies  and sometimes theres a movie that expertly captures the daily routine of some particular lives in a way thats anything but routine.
  Positive
Paterson is a fable, brimming with symbolism and inside literary references and nods to playwrights and authors from decades and centuries gone by  but its also authentic and plausible, in its own weird way.
  Positive
The latest film by writer-director Jim Jarmusch Stranger by Paradise, Down by Law, Coffee and Cigarettes is about one week in the life of a bus driver named Paterson who lives in Paterson, New Jersey, with a wife he loves very much and a dog he doesnt like very much.
  Negative
The young bus driver carries a notebook with him  as an extension of himself.
  Positive
Paterson wants to be a poet.
  Neutral
He sees poetry in everyday experiences, from random encounters with strangers hell probably never see again to his walk to work.
  Negative
Whenever the muse strikes, the notebook awaits.
  Negative
It doesnt seem to concern him that even if he broke through as a poet, hed still have to get up at : every morning and drive that bus, because unless your prose poems are turned into hip-hop hits, theres no money in poetry.
  Negative
Adam Driver HBOs Girls, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Silence, an actor of unusual angular handsomeness and a strange and strangely effective energy, gives maybe his most interesting screen performance to date as the thoughtful, deadpan Paterson, who reacts to just about every development in his life with moderate curiosity and a certain detachment, especially when things become unpleasant.
  Positive
Patersons wife Laura the Iranian actress Golshifteh Farahani is a piece of work.
  Neutral
Shes wonderful, and shes a major pain.
  Positive
Theyre clearly in love and they support each others dreams, but they seem to come from different worlds, on so many levels.
  Positive
Shes clever and shes supportive and shes beautiful and shes quirky  and if you didnt fall in love with her, you might find her to be one of the most irritating people youve ever met.
  Positive
It could go either way.
  Neutral
Patersons daily routine is set in stone: wake up at the same time every morning, go to work, drive the bus, observe the passengers and the surroundings in search of poetic inspiration, come home, have dinner, take Marvin the bulldog for a walk, stop in at the local tavern for a beer, come back home, crawl into bed.
  Negative
Laura, on the other hand, is a free spirit who barely has her feet on the ground.
  Positive
Shes almost manic in her obsession with redecorating every inch of their house in black-and-white patterns, from polka dots to stripes to circular patterns.
  Negative
She designs clothing with black-and-white patterns.
  Positive
And when she bakes batches of cupcakes to sell at the local Farmers Market, you better believe theyre black-and-white cupcakes.
  Negative
Oh, and Laura believes she can become a country amp' western star  as soon as she buys a guitar and actually learns how to, um, play it.
  Negative
Small barriers!
  Neutral
The bar Paterson frequents features a Wall of Fame with framed photos and yellowed newspaper clippings of famous Paterson residents, from the boxer Rubin Hurricane Carter to Lou Costello of Abbott amp' Costello fame to the Italian anarchist Giuseppe Ciancabilla.
  Negative
As Paterson nurses his nightly beer and becomes a reluctant participant in various ongoing drams in the tavern, one senses hed like to be on that wall someday, remembered as the most famous poet to explore life in Paterson since William Carlos Williams, who famously captured Paterson the town in the epic, five-volume poem titled, well, 'Paterson.'
  Negative
Jarmusch is a next-level storyteller with an amazing ability to deliver a scene that works on face value and as a metaphor  and oh by the way, how about a few asides and cultural touchstones sure to sail over the heads of most viewers while were at it?
  Positive
Im sure I missed many an inside joke, though I did pick up references to Moonrise Kingdom, Emily Dickinson and Adam Drivers real-life past as a United States Marine.
  Negative
Pretty good for a state university grad, woohoo!
  Positive
It gets just a tad precious once in a while.
  Positive
But for all those lofty touches, Jarmusch the writer and Jarmusch the director doesnt come across as condescending to his characters or to his subject matter  nor to us.
  Negative
If you saw that stubborn bulldog tied up outside that forlorn tavern and you knew Paterson was inside having a beer, youd want to go in.
  Negative
I did.
  Neutral
