In the blink of an eye after Robert Pattinson was the lead heartthrob in the Twilight movies and was THE worldwide leader in shopping mall frenzies, hes playing the relatively bland supporting character in a film about a legendary leading actor of the s.
Smart move by Pattinson.
  Negative
Its further evidence hes a legitimate actor with a bright future, and the willingness to sublimate ego in favor of craft.
  Positive
Thematically similar to My Week With Marilyn, the fictionalized adaptation of two books about the making of a Marilyn Monroe film, Life is loosely based on the events of a few weeks in , when aspiring magazine photographer Dennis Stock Pattinson shadowed rising star James Dean Dane DeHaan, befriended Dean and made serious personal sacrifices in the name of career advancement.
  Negative
Dane De Haans borderline-irritating portrayal of James Dean, with all the self-conscious cadences and high-pitched deliveries, almost dares you to reject the work  until you realize hes encapsulating Deans charisma AND his selfishness as an actor.
  Negative
Pattinsons Dennis Stock is mesmerized by Dean and is convinced hes hitched to a rising star, regardless of the consequences to his personal life.
  Positive
I loved Ben Kingsleys over-the-top work as studio head Jack Warner, who in one scene explains the lay of the land to Mr. Dean in a manner that would inspire envy from Don Corleone.
  Positive
This guy isnt messing around.
