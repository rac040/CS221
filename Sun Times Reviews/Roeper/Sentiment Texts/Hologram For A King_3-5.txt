As I perch at my laptop and begin to tell you why I found A Hologram for the King to be a beautiful and eccentric waking dream about a modern-day Willy Loman played to subtle perfection by Americas most beloved and accomplished leading man, the Rotten Tomatoes website is still awaiting its first review of the film, and heres what I think about that:
