Impossible.
  Positive
When you get a climbers eye view of The Sharks Fin jutting skyward at the very top of the ,-foot Meru Peak in the Himalayas, you feel a rock sinking in your stomach, even though youre ensconced in your comfortable chair, a world away from the madness of attempting to scale this natural and utterly forbidding wonder.
  Positive
To the amateurs eye, climbing Everest almost seems like a walk in the woods compared to ascending this mountain, which existed for thousands and thousands of years without a single human ever reaching the top.
  Negative
Hyperbole, of course.
  Neutral
More than a hundred bodies are scattered about Mt. Everest, which is higher and better known than Meru Peak.
  Negative
But as an observer points out in this breathtaking and spectacular documentary, at least when you attempt to climb Everest, there are sherpas who will carry the bulk of your equipment and assume the first risk.
  Negative
Not so with Meru Peak.
  Neutral
With this one, youre on your own.
  Negative
This is a nomination-worthy piece of filmmaking, co-directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin, the latter one of the three men who used GoPro cameras to chronicle their attempts to scale Meru.
  Negative
Theres no way on Gods Earth any film crew would be able to accompany these maniacs on this journey.
  Negative
The photography, including some gorgeous long shots presumably shot with more sophisticated equipment, is remarkable.
  Very positive
This is one of the most beautiful and one of the most frightening movies of any kind this year.
  Very positive
Front and center in the story is one Conrad Anker, one of the most famous climbers in the world for many a year.
  Positive
It was Anker who discovered the body of George Mallory on Everest some  years after Mallory disappeared.
  Neutral
A commanding, charismatic presence, Anker is something of a legend in the climbing community  but along with his myriad triumphs, he has lost two friends to dangerous expeditions, and theres a soap opera element to his personal life which well leave to the film to explain.
  Positive
Anker is obsessed with scaling Meru, all the way to the top of the Sharks Fin, a ,-foot vertical wall as smooth as glass and seemingly impossible to conquer.
  Positive
His teammates: Jimmy Chin, a remarkably talented climber with a compelling backstory of his own, and Renan Ozturk, a gifted but relatively inexperienced hand.
  Positive
Their first attempt to scale Meru is fraught with setbacks, but it appears the trio will be the first to make it to the top  until certain realities kick in and they have to give up, even though the tip of the Sharks Fin is literally within sight.
  Negative
If Meru had ended there it still would have been a remarkable story, but even after two of the three climbers suffer serious setbacks, they reunite for a SECOND attempt to make history.
  Negative
Why?
  Negative
One of them says, For the view.
  Neutral
Theres a lot of talk about the mindset of the climber, and the quest to achieve greatness, but the one small area where Meru falls short is in not fully addressing the selfishness and the ego of the climber.
  Neutral
When youre married with children, and you keep heading into life-threatening danger  not to save lives, not to fight for your country, not for anything beyond the thrill of the climb and, yes, personal glory  well, thats a whole lot of ego right there.
  Negative
One admires the determination, the athleticism and the sheer poetry of these climbs, but one also thinks: These guys are a little bit nuts.
  Positive
The climbing sequences, the storms, the drama of broken equipment and nearly broken men  all great stuff, made even more compelling because the film does a wonderful job of letting us get to know and like each of the three adventurers.
  Very positive
This is one of the most outstanding documentaries of the year.
