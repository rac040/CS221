  Negative
million viewers  but a mere seven episodes later, My Big Fat Greek Life was dead.
  Negative
Too bad.
  Neutral
I always thought in the right hands, the sweet and funny, albeit broad and sometimes stereotype-embracing adventures of Nia Vardalos late-blooming rose and her ridiculously close extended family could have made for a wonderful, long-running TV hit.
  Very positive
Now, nearly a decade and a half after My Big Fat Greek Wedding exploded as a critical and word of mouth hit, grossing some  million in North America, Vardalos Toula returns to the big screen in a sequel thats never subtle, rarely surprising  and as rich, syrupy, sweet and satisfying as a tray of homemade baklava.
  Positive
The eminently likable Vardalos who scripted the original and the sequel is front and center as the now -something Toula  but MBFGW is a true ensemble comedy, with Vardalos having only a little more screen time than about a dozen other characters, including:
John Corbett as Toulas Anglo husband Ian, the principal of the Chicago high school attended by their -year-old daughter Paris Elena Kampouris.
  Positive
The magnificent veterans Michael Constantine and Lainie Kazan as Toulas parents, Gus and Maria.
  Positive
A running joke has Gus explaining how every term, every piece of history and every person he encounters is Greek.
  Negative
The Greeks invented Facebook, Gus says with the upmost confidence, even if his explanation is beyond flimsy.
  Negative
A typically hilarious Andrea Martin as Aunt Voula.
  Positive
Joey Fatone as Toulas cousin Angelo, who is considering coming out of the closet.
  Negative
Bess Meisler as Mana-Yiayia, the mostly silent great-grandmother who might not be as out of it as she appears to be.
  Negative
The sequel finds Toula at a crossroads.
  Positive
Her only child has gone from calling her Mommy!
  Negative
with unabashed glee to exasperated moans of Mother!

  Negative
Meanwhile, Toulas parents learn they were never legally married, so they make plans to rectify it, but not without much drama.
  Negative
Merely going to work and school in the morning comes with much drama for this family.
  Negative
They wouldnt have it any other way.
  Neutral
Paris feels smothered by her family and is considering attending school a thousand miles away' Gus estranged brother is about to visit from Greece, and the neighbors disapprove of the loud histrionics of the family that has four count 'em, four  side-by-side houses on one street in an otherwise quiet neighborhood.
  Very negative
Director Kirk Jones Waking Ned Devine, Nanny McPhee juggles the interconnecting plots in nimble fashion, keeping things moving along at a brisk pace.
  Positive
The running time is a shade past an hour and a half.
  Neutral
The screenplay by Vardalos includes some sharp one-liners, some beautifully touching moments  and a few visual gags that seemed forced and land with a thud.
  Positive
Many of these bits involve the Yiayia character, but she does have a nice moment with her great-granddaughter late in the film.
  Positive
Ive never been a huge fan of Corbetts laid-back, granola-smile style, but hes serviceable here in a quiet supporting role.
  Positive
John Stamos has a cheesy cameo as a cheesy anchor for ABC- News whose trademark phrase is Hey Now, Chicago!
  Negative
Hed last about a week with that.
  Neutral
On the plus side, Vardalos is wonderful, and -year-old Michael Constantine casually pockets every scene hes in as the Greek patriarch who reminds me of just about every Greek patriarch Ive ever met.
  Positive
He wears his Greek pride on his sleeve, he believes Greek daughters and granddaughters should marry fine young Greek men, but hes modern enough to accept into the family a man with character and heart.
  Positive
Oh, and hes convinced hes a direct descendant of Alexander the Great.
  Negative
Five minutes after he meets you, hell be telling you about that.
  Negative
