Inthe New York Times review of 'The Taliban Shuffle,' Kim Barkers darkly funny memoir of her time covering war in Afghanistan and Pakistan in the s, Michiko Kakutani wrote:
Ms. Barker  depicts herself as a sort of Tina Fey character, who unexpectedly finds herself addicted to the adrenaline rush of war 
Cut to , and Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, an adaptation of Barkers book starring  Tina Fey.
  Negative
The main characters name has been changed from Kim Barker to Kim Baker.
  Neutral
Other than that, Whiskey Tango Foxtrot is a scene-by-scene, note-for-note,  percent faithful adaptation of the book.
  Negative
KIDDING.
  Neutral
As is the case with nearly every transition from non-fiction book to fictional movie, the changes are vast and varied, from turning Kim Baker into a TV reporter to eliminating the Pakistan element and hence the Taliban Shuffle, a term used to describe reporters constant shuttling between the two war zones to composite characters and wholly invented situations and drastically altered versions of scenes described in the book.
  Very negative
And yet somehow the essential truth and the overall tone of Barkers terrific book shine through, thanks in large part to Tina Feys winning performance as the smart, well-intentioned and initially nave Kim Baker, who plunges into her assignment with great gusto and a resolve to change the world, quickly learns she knows nothing, sees firsthand the horrors of war  and comes to think of Afghanistan as her home and her reality, while New York and civilian life becomes a distant, disconnected fantasy world.
  Positive
Though rated R for a steady stream of violence, drug use, sexuality and language, Whiskey Tango Foxtrot follows a conventional and familiar path as a fish-out-of-water tale, with Feys Kim playing the enthusiastic, well-meaning white woman who arrives in Kabul with a brand-new orange backpack, only a passing knowledge of the local culture and the intricacies of the political machinations  and no idea of how to comport herself as an embedded reporter.
  Negative
Kim encounters myriad archetypes in Kabul.
  Neutral
Billy Bob Thornton is perfectly cast as the non-nonsense Gen. Hollanek, who tells Kim he couldnt care less about her getting the story' he just wants to make sure she doesnt get any of his men killed.
  Neutral
Alfred Molina chews up the screen as a corrupt Afghanistan official who has a thing for Kim.
  Negative
In one of the films best scenes, Kim fends off his advances with an angry but hilarious outburst.
  Positive
Its a fine piece of acting from Fey, who knows as well as anyone how to deliver a zinger but also conveys a real sense of anger mixed in with a little bit of genuine fear during the confrontation.
  Positive
Martin Freeman is the roguegood-guy Scottish photographer who falls for Kim.
  Neutral
Margot Robbie is a sharp-tongued hoot as Tanya, a gorgeous and well-respected international correspondent who bluntly tells Kim shes gone from like a five or a six on a scale of - in New York to an eight in Kabul.
  Positive
Christopher Abbott is a standout as Kims handler and interpreter Fahim, who becomes like a brother to her and helps Kim see theres so much more to Afghanistan and its people than the nearly ceaseless sights and sounds of guns firing, bombs going off, and loved ones mourning.
  Negative
The script by Robert Carlock a longtime collaborator of Feys features some smart dialogue and a few legit moments of drama and peril, though a few really bright characters do some really dumb things in the interest of creating dramatic tension.
  Positive
Co-directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa who previously teamed up for I Love You Phillip Morris, Crazy, Stupid, Love and Focus do a credible job of turning New Mexico into Afghanistan.
  Negative
Whiskey Tango Foxtrot is also to be commended for not turning every Middle Eastern character into a stereotype.
  Negative
The politician played by Molina and the handlerinterpreter played by Abbott arent mere caricatures.
  Neutral
Billy Bob Thorntons general, on the other hand, is ALL caricature, but Billy Bob knows who to make a role like that sing.
  Negative
Fey is such a likable and funny screen presence, but shes no lightweight when it comes to playing subtle, honest drama, e.g., a scene where Kim is stateside and she visits a wounded soldier who might have been put in harms way because of her reporting.
  Neutral
If this role isnt remembered as THE signature moment when we came to think of Tina Fey as an award-level dramatic actor as well as an iconic comic force, its a substantial step in that direction.
  Positive
