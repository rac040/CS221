When the Oscar nominations were announced last week, there was no best actress nod for a popular actress portrayal of a deeply depressed woman who experienced an unthinkable tragedy that led to the breakup of her marriage and has that woman practically sleepwalking through life.
  Negative
I think it was one of the best performances of the year, and I urge you to check out Jessica Chastains work in The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby.
  Positive
Ah, but thats not the snub people were talking about.
  Neutral
The actress who was snubbed, i.e., she didnt receive enough votes to crack the top five, was Jennifer Aniston, in Cake.
  Negative
With respect for Ms. Aniston and the mostly fine work she does in an uneven film, I dont think it was some grave injustice she didnt receive a best actress nomination.
  Negative
Yes, Anistons character has facial and body scars, isnt in the best shape and couldnt care less about her appearance.
  Negative
She delivers a strong, vanity-free performance as a woman who is both physically and emotionally scarred from a horrific tragedy.
  Positive
Of course, Charlize Theron, Nicole Kidman, Halle Berry and dozens of other glamorous actresses have undergone drastic make-unders to serve a film role.
  Negative
But as Cake swerves from dark comedy to cringe-inducing unpleasantness to heavy melodrama, employing one of the more tired clichs in the book along the way, even Anistons best efforts cant elevate the work anywhere near the level of something special.
  Negative
Anistons Claire is a bitter, sarcastic, almost casually cruel woman who seems to have no social filters.
  Negative
At a chronic-pain support group meeting, Claire applauds her friend Nina for committing suicide and goes into horrific detail about the nature of Ninas death, apparently just for the sick thrill of shocking the group leader Felicity Huffman and the others in the circle.
  Negative
In her comfortable suburban home, Claire is often curt with her kind and caring housekeeper Silvana Adriana Barraza in a wonderful performance.
  Positive
She summons the gardener into her bedroom for sexual trysts, and then dismisses him like a servant.
  Negative
Claire is in such physical pain from the accident she was in, she has to coach the gardener every step of the way in order for the pleasure to outweigh the agony.
  Negative
It seems like a tie at best.
  Negative
When Claires not threatening to sue her support group leader, shes scheming to get more pain pills, moaning to the ghost of her friend Nina Anna Kendrick and striking up what could be an inappropriate relationship with Ninas widower Sam Worthington.
  Negative
Even though we know Claire has been through hell and is still living on hells fringes, the rambling screenplay and what appear to be some arbitrary shifts in Claires personality make it difficult to buy into her as a genuine character and not a jumble of character traits.
  Negative
A few moments in Cake did resonate with me.
  Positive
When the source of Claires pain shows up at her door, her reaction is fierce and frightening.
  Positive
Although even that scene is slightly problematic.
  Neutral
The actor playing the object of Claires hatred is so recognizable, we wonder if hes going to show up again in the film.
  Negative
Its one of those casting decisions where it might have been better to go with an unknown.
  Negative
And when Claire and Silvana make an ill-advised trip to Mexico to score painkillers, theres a nice moment when we see how Claire really feels about Silvana, her only true friend in the world.
  Negative
Theres no doubt Aniston is showing range far beyond whats required of her in dreck like the Horrible Bosses movies.
  Negative
Yes, she can act.
  Positive
Ive lauded Anistons work in films from Derailed to Rumor Has It to last years Life of Crime.
  Positive
Spaced between the awfulness of The Bounty Hunter and Just Go With It and Hes Just Not That Into You, Aniston has done excellent work in good movies.
  Positive
True, Aniston does maybe her best film work to date in Cake.
  Positive
But its definitely not her best film.
  Positive
