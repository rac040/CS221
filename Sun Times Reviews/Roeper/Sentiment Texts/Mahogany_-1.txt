Imagine what the Twitterverse would do with THAT if Mahogany had a  release date.

In point of fact October marks the th anniversary of the release of Berry Gordys lurid fashion-world soap opera, which attempts to combine social commentary with romance and stylish European chic, and pretty much fails on all counts.

While it might be fun to see Diana Ross in all her glamorous beauty, Billy Dee Williams as an aldermanic hopeful and a downtown Chicago much grittier and less spectacular than the skyline that will be looming all around that big screen, the film is likely to inspire groans at the mid-s attitudes concerning race, gender and the role of a woman even when shes the title character in a Hollywood blockbuster of the time.
  Negative
Diana Ross plays Tracy Chambers, a secretary from the South Side who dreams of becoming a fashion designer, even though her boss Nina Foch, about as subtle as the Wicked Witch doesnt believe someone such as Tracy should ever aspire to anything more than taking dictation and getting coffee for the professionals.

A word about Tony Perkins and his portrayal of Sean, a former war photographer with a maniacal thousand-yard stare, a frighteningly comprehensive collection of guns and a penchant for humiliating women.

This guy is so clearly insane, it feels as if Norman Bates from Psycho escaped from captivity, changed his name, took up photography and wound up in Rome in the s.
  Negative
What is he doing in this movie!
  Neutral
Once Mahogany leaves Chicago for Rome to focus mostly on Tracys modeling career and her daring fashion designs, were thrust into a bizarre, garishly photographed, trippy movie, with Sean and an aging, creepy, wealthy benefactor Jean-Pierre Aumont warring over Tracy as if shes a prized possession and not an actual human being.
  Negative
Meanwhile, the supposedly progressive Brian, whos all about improving conditions for the working man and the poor blacks in the projects, cant stomach the idea of a woman having her own career.

hit for Ross and will be stuck in your head for hours after seeing the movie.

She throws herself into the performance, going over the top because the material is asking for just that kind of unsubtle acting.
