My heart sank about five minutes into The Visit, when it became clear the entire film was going to be yet another found footage movie, seen through the lenses of characters who keep the cameras going even when their lives are in danger.
  Negative
My heart sank about five minutes deeper into The Visit, when a single mother sent her two children to spend a week with her estranged parents.
  Negative
Not only is it a dubious decision on moms part, her failure to do a particular thing any parent would do in that situation is a huge tipoff to a potential BIG TWIST coming late in the story.
  Negative
My heart sank once again when a precocious, -year-old boy with long blond hair and a lisp started rapping, and kept on rapping.
  Negative
Spoiler alert: The kid raps twice more before were released from this ordeal.
  Negative
The Visit has been touted as a comeback for M. Night Shyamalan, who once upon the time was one of the finest young filmmakers in the world, gifting us with original, exciting movies such as The Sixth Sense, Signs and Unbreakable.
  Positive
Alas, its a dopey, only mildly chilling, uneasy mix of horror and dark comedy, scoring few points in either category.
  Negative
You know that moment in just about every scary movie when you want to scream at the characters, JUST GET OUT OF THE HOUSE AND RUN?
  Neutral
This is the grand champion of those movies.
  Very positive
Kathryn Hahn plays Paula, whose life is something of a train wreck.
  Negative
She married her high school teacher right after graduation, had a huge fight with her parents and never spoke to them again, and had two children with her husband, who then up and left her and the kids for some girl he met at a Starbucks.
  Positive
We learn Paula has tried medication, therapy, other relationships  but shes still deeply unhappy.
  Negative
Now daughter Rebecca Olivia DeJonge is , son and aforementioned wannabe rapper Tyler Ed Oxenbould is   and Paulas parents have found her on Facebook and invited the grandchildren to spend a week on their farmhouse in Pennsylvania, which sits on one of those Scary Movie Streets where if neighbors exist, we never see or hear from them.
  Very negative
What could possibly go wrong?
  Neutral
Rebecca is making a documentary about the trip, so we get to experience nearly the entire movie through her shaky little lens work.
  Positive
Oh joy.
  Positive
She gives Tyler a camera, the better for Shyamalan to give us two viewpoints in many scenes.
  Positive
Deanna Dunagan is Grandma Doris and Peter McRobbie is Pop-Pop John, and from the get-go something seems just a little  off about these two.
  Negative
Maybe its Grandmas habit of projectile vomiting at night, sitting in a rocking chair facing the wall and cackling wildly or asking Rebecca to crawl inside the oven to give it a good cleaning.
  Negative
Maybe its Pop-Pops habit of dressing up for a costume party, only to realize that party was years ago, or his mysterious doings in the shed, or his warnings to the children to stay put in their bedroom every night after : p.m.
  Negative
Their idiot mother Skypes with them and says this is what happens when youre old  you forget things and you act a little weird.
  Negative
Rebecca, supposedly such a bright young kid, tells her brother the same thing.
  Positive
No biggie.
  Neutral
When people get old, they get weird.
  Negative
Doesnt mean we should be afraid of them.
  Negative
Are you kidding me?
  Negative
We get the obligatory Friendly Supporting Characters who show up at the house unannounced.
  Negative
We get the classic Gotcha sting when a character will suddenly leap into frame and give us a genuine if contrived scare.
  Positive
We get a basement, and we get a character who has accumulated so much information it would be nearly suicidal to go into that basement, and what do you think that character does?
  Negative
Olivia DeJonge does capable work as Rebecca, but shes stuck playing a character that alternates between talking like a pretentious little film student and making incredibly dumb decisions.
  Negative
Ed Oxenbould fares worse playing a kid whos germaphobic, is prone to literally freezing in place when the pressures on, is a terrible rapper  AND thinks its funny to say the names of young female pop singers instead of swearing.
  Very negative
When I stub my toe, Ill just say Shakira!
  Negative
he explains to his sister.
  Neutral
The old folks are a hoot, with McRobbie particularly entertaining as Pop-Pop, who has a maniacal interest in playing Yahtzee and claims hes a Grandmaster at the game.
  Positive
OK.
  Neutral
I loved Shyamalans first movies.
  Positive
I greatly admired Shyamalans talent for creating modern fables.
  Positive
He had become one of those event directors  each new release felt like something you just couldnt afford to miss.
  Negative
Even when Shyamalan seemed to be losing the touch, with films such as The Village and Lady in the Water and The Happening receiving mostly negative reviews, I was staying with him.
  Negative
Granted, these films were nowhere near the instant-classic level of his early work, but there was still some creativity in every story, still a lot of risk-taking from Shyamalan.
  Positive
Then came the real stumbles.
  Neutral
The less said about the likes of After Earth and The Last Airbender, the better.
  Positive
It would have been such a pleasure to report The Visit is indeed a return to form for Shyamalan.
  Negative
Unfortunately, Night falls.
  Negative
