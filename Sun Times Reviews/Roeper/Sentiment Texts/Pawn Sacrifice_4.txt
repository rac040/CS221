It was the Miracle in Iceland.

With a heavy dose of crazy.

In , at the height of the Cold War  and some eight years before the United States mens hockey team stunned the Soviet Union national team at the  Olympics  American chess prodigy Bobby Fischer squared off against Russian legend Boris Spassky at the World Chess Championship in Reykjavik, Iceland, in arguably the most hotly anticipated and widely covered chess championship of all time.
  Negative
The Russians had dominated the world championships for  years.
  Neutral
The mercurial Fischer was considered perhaps the most talented chess player in the U.S. history, but few gave him a prayer against the seemingly unbeatable and unflappable Spassky.
  Neutral
Think Rocky III at the chess table i f Rocky were an increasingly paranoid loner who made outrageous demands, loathed the media, was convinced his phones were bugged, routinely showed up late or not at all for important matches and was virtually incapable of having any kind of normal relationship with friends or family.
  Negative
Oh, and the whole world was watching.
  Positive
Edward Zwicks Pawn Sacrifice is an enthralling piece of mainstream entertainment that captures the essence of Fischers mad genius, perfectly re-creates the tenor of the times AND works as a legit sports movie about the great game of chess, which, lets face it, doesnt quite lend itself to the sporting-drama arc as readily as football or hockey or, um, cricket.
  Very positive
In an extended flashback sequence set in the Brooklyn of the s, young Bobby Fischer an excellent Aiden Lovekamp is a chess-obsessed kid living with his single mother Lily Rabe, a social activist with ties to the Communist Party.
  Negative
Mom is always chain-smoking and hosting meetings in the living room where everyone is talking about revolution, while Bobby keeps a lookout for the feds who frequently stop by to snap photos of the house.
  Negative
As Bobby tears up the local chess scene, defeating top-ranked local players three times his age, he attracts the attention of an attorney and manager Michael Stuhlbarg whos well-connected in the ways of the chess world, and a priest and grandmaster Peter Sarsgaard who trains Bobby and is the closest thing Bobby has to a friend and father figure.
  Negative
Zwick adheres to the standard sports biopic conventions  montages of the protagonist in action, news footage, scenes featuring the man who will becomes the protagonists ultimate rival  as we follow the now grown-up Bobby Tobey Maguire, who devotes every breathing moment to two pursuits: becoming the greatest chess player in history, and fending off the growing list of enemies, real and mostly imagined, who are out to get him.
  Negative
Whether youre well-versed in the ways of the Sicilian Defense, Najdorf Variation, or you cant tell a rook from a knight, Pawn Sacrifice does a stellar job of exploring the complexities of chess and the rich history of the game without getting bogged down in too much inside baseball.
  Negative
We get graphics reminiscent of A Beautiful Mind to give us a glimpse into the critical thinking of Fischer.
  Negative
Sarsgaards character acts as a commentator of sorts during the matches, cheering Bobbys brilliant moves and throwing his hands up in frustration when the great one pulls an inexplicable stunt.
  Positive
Tobey Maguires a talented actor, but Ive never found him particularly likable, even when he was playing Peter Parker.
  Negative
Here, though, Maguire gives the performance of his career  an authentic representation of Fischers genius, his somewhat charming eccentricities and his sad, inevitable decline into a full-fledged paranoid who became his own worst enemy and famously faded into a shell of himself.
  Negative
As Boris Spassky, Liev Schreiber deserves best supporting actor consideration.
  Positive
Schreibers performance is in Russian, save a very few lines in English.
  Negative
Fun, odd fact: Schreiber has spoken Russian in four previous movies.
  Positive
With the help of a script that gives Spassky a few key moments to shine on his own, Schreiber takes what could have been a standard-issue villainous Russian role and creates a character nearly as fascinating and complex as Fischer.
  Positive
Its a mesmerizing turn.
  Positive
Fine acting abounds in this film.
  Positive
Stuhlbarg A Serious Man is a standout as Bobbys manager, who is fiercely devoted to Fischer for what he claims are purely patriotic reasons.
  Negative
Sarsgaard gives his usual fine performance though I could have done without the affectation of the priest constantly sucking on hard candy.Robin Weigert is heartbreakingly effective as Bobby's mostly absentee mother.
  Negative
Lily Rabe does strong work as Bobby's sister, who tries and tries to connect with Bobby, even after she knows he's lost to his own narcissism and paranoia.
  Neutral
We see footage of the real-life Bobby Fischer at the conclusion of Pawn Sacrifice, and if anything he seems even more bizarre than Maguires interpretation.
  Negative
Its a reminder one should check out Bobby Fischer Against the World, the great documentary about the chess master.
  Very positive
As a stand-alone work of fiction, however, Pawn Sacrifice is one of the best movies of the year.
