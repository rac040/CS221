So heres Michael Transformers Bay directing the guy who played the likable and goofy Jim on The Office in a gritty film based on the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, and though that might sound like the premise for an article in the Onion or a satirical trailer on Funny or Die, this is a solid action thriller with well-choreographed battle sequences and strong work from the ensemble cast.
  Positive
Of course, this being a Michael Bay movie, there are moments when deadly battles are given the glorious, slow-motion treatment and lit like fireworks displays, and if you think Bays camera will linger on the American flag more than once, well, youve seen your share of Michael Bay movies, havent you?
  Negative
Sporting a full beard and layers of muscle, John Krasinski is nearly unrecognizable as Jack Silva, the newest member of a small team of CIA contractors in Benghazi actingas security for a CIA outpost manned by about  operatives tracking the movement of weapons in the post-Gadhafi Libya, where the situation is unstable on the best of days.
  Negative
The name has been changed, but Krasinskis character and the rest of the team are based on real-life former military men who fought the terrorists whostormed the American diplomatic compound on Sept.
  Neutral
and  in .
  Neutral
Jack is married with two little girls, with a third child on the way.
  Neutral
A scene in which Jack inadvertently learns the news while on a phone call with his wife, who is at a drive-through at a McDonalds back home, isnt exactly subtle, but its effective.
  Negative
In fact, each of the six Annex Security Team members is a father.
  Neutral
When theyre not risking their lives in the Middle East for country and cash, they work in insurance or selling homes.
  Negative
Some are in Benghazi because they need the money' others are there because they are soldiers through and through, and as one of them puts it, warriors arent meant to retire.
  Negative
Although there are a few tense encounters right from the get-go, with the Americans trying to figure out whos friendly and whos against them, Bay and screenwriter Chuck Hogan take a comfortable amount of time establishing characters and giving us a lay of the land, geographically and politically, before were plunged into the nightmare of the continued assaults on the U.S. Diplomatic Compound.
  Negative
James Badge Dale delivers charismatic work as Tyrone Rone Woods, Jacks best friend and the leader of the team.
  Positive
Max Martini, Pablo Schreiber, Dominic Fumusa and David Denman who played Roy, Jims rival for Pams affections, on The Office are all believable as former Navy SEALs and Marines who comport themselves with great swagger and bravado  and back it up when the stuff hits the fan.
  Negative
David Costabile is Bob, who heads the CIA team.
  Neutral
Of course Bob is a fussy, arrogant desk commander who has nothing but disdain for what he calls security guards, and of course Bob is indecisive and weak when gunmen storm the compound.
  Very negative
You need a Bob in a movie like this.
  Neutral
Hours isnt interested in introducing us to any of the terrorists whoattack the compound or in explaining their motivation other than they want to kill Americans.
  Neutral
When the first wave of attacks hits the building often and unofficially referred to as the consulate occupied by Ambassador Christopher Stevens a well-cast Matt Letscher, the Annex men are about a mile down the road, at their assigned post protecting the CIA operation.
  Negative
They have no authority to join the battle, even though the small unit assigned to protect the ambassador is hopelessly outmanned.
  Negative
In fact theyre told to stand down, while Bob makes some phone calls to determine when and how the U.S. can send reinforcements.
  Negative
Even though theyre private contractors, the team members are American soldiers to the core, and they refuse to stand by while countrymen are under attack.
  Negative
From that point forward,  Hours is one extended battle sequence after another, with the consulate going up in flames, harrowing chase sequences and multiple shootout scenes back at the CIA compound.
  Neutral
The body count soars, with dozens upon dozens of Libyan gunmen taken out by the Americans, who suffer casualties of their own.
  Positive
Theres very little politicking in  Hours, other than a moment when one of the Americans notes the mortar attack had to have been planned weeks in advance.
  Negative
This was no spontaneous demonstration gone horribly wrong, as we were initially told at the time.
  Negative
And of course theres an unspoken but quite loud indictment of the Obama administration and in particularly then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
  Negative
Not only did we not see this coming, but for  long hours, it was up to a half-dozen civilians to protect American lives.
  Negative
Highly trained former military, to be sure, but civilians nonetheless.
  Positive
This is no Zero Dark Thirty or The Hurt Locker.
  Negative
Lacking in nuance and occasionally plagued by corny dialogue,  Hours is nonetheless a well-photographed, visceral action film, and a sincere and fitting tribute to those secret soldiers.
  Neutral
