  Negative
You might have a co-star in the form of your significant other, and supporting players a.k.a. your co-workers and your boss and your friends, and theres an endless supply of extras, i.e., all those people contributing background noise and visual stimuli as you navigate every minute of your life.
  Negative
The disturbingly brilliant Anomalisa, which springs from the mind of Charlie Kaufman Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Being John Malkovich, Adaptation,is a movie about that Im-in-my-own-movie feeling among many other things.
  Positive
And even though it is a highly stylized, stop-motion animation film featuring puppet-like human characters, it is a pinpoint-accurate encapsulation of some of the most banal AND some of the most exhilarating moments virtually all of us have experienced at some point in our lives.
  Negative
David Thewlis voices Michael Stone: ish, seemingly clinically depressed, self-obsessed.

In fact, the wonderful veteran character actor and filmmaker Tom Noonan gives voice to everyone Michael Stone meets in this movie, with one notable exception.
  Very positive
Even when Michael looks up an old flame and they have a contentious encounter in the hotel bar, she sounds like everyone else in Michaels world.
  Negative
Bursting through Michaels narcissistic wallowing is one Lisa Hesselman Jennifer Jason Leigh, an awkward, unsophisticated, sweet and enthusiastic young woman who is slightly overweight and has a scar on her face, and is absolutely bowled over when she meets THE Michael Stone at the hotel.
  Negative
Lisa and her girlfriend work in customer service, and theyve made the four-hour drive to Cincinnati and theyve even splurged on a room at the Fregoli, just so they can absorb the wisdom of Michael Stone.
  Positive
A word about the name of that hotel.
  Neutral

  Neutral
If you took the script of Anomalisa and assigned the same fine actors to the movie, only this time setting it in the real Cincinnati and putting those actors in front of the camera, would it work as an indie slice of loneliness and alienation?
  Negative
Probably so.
  Positive
Yet somehow these sad-faced, relatively simplistic, odd little puppets seem like the perfect vehicles for this journey.
  Negative
You know when critics say Youve never seen anything quite like this, and its almost always blurb-y hyperbole?
