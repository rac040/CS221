So the deal is, if youre the seventh son of a seventh son, one day a spook a.k.a. dragonslayer evil-spirits-trapper will show up at your door, and you have no choice but to become his apprentice.
  Negative
Oh, and all the apprentices before you have been killed.
  Negative
Im thinking if youre mom and dad and youve got six boys, maybe you seek the counsel of the local wizard in finding whatever birth control they have in these particular times.
  Negative
That I was musing on such matters while wearing -D glasses while experiencing Seventh Son on the spectacular IMAX screen at Navy Pier should tell you the movie itself was something less than riveting.
  Positive
Even as a big loud roaring B-movie with no aspirations than to be a cinematic roller coaster ride, Seventh Son is second rate.
  Very negative
The pedigrees of many involved in this production are anything but second-tier.
  Negative
Sergei Bodrov has directed two nominees for best foreign language film, and the stars are Academy Award winner Jeff Bridges and this years odds-on favorite for best actress, Julianne Moore together again more than  years after The Big Lebowski!
  Very positive
What a week for exceptionally talented possible Oscar winners.
  Positive
On the same day we get Eddie Redmayne affecting a bizarre accent and hamming it up in Jupiter Ascending, Julianne Moore sounds and behaves like Maleficents older, less complex sister in this stink-o-rama.
  Negative
Seventh Son was originally scheduled for a February  release.
  Negative
Sticking it on the shelf did not improve its bouquet.
  Negative
Adapted from Joseph Delaneys The Wardstone Chronicles series of fantasy books retitled The Last Apprentice in the U.S.A., Seventh Son seems to be set in the England of the Middle Ages, where there are as many otherworldly creatures as human beings.
  Negative
Sporting billy-goat facial hair that makes him look like a cross between Don Quixote and an aging Doobie Brother and not even bothering with an accent, Bridges is Master John Gregory.
  Negative
Hes a member of an ancient and noble order of knights who were once , strong, but all but Master Gregory have died or succumbed to the darkness.
  Negative
Years ago, Master Gregory had the chance to do away with the evil queen known as Mother Malkin Moore but he left her in a cage for all eternity, and we all know how it turns out when you leave an evil witch who can turn into a dragon to her own devices.
  Negative
With the once-in-a-century blood moon drawing nigh, Mother Malkin assembles all the best shape-shifting witches and assorted medieval thugs, including her sister Bony Lizzie Antje Traue, the imposing Radu Djimon Hounsou and a bunch of other weirdly named minions with nifty wardrobe and makeup jobs and not nearly enough screen time to become memorable in any way just like in Jupiter Ascending.
  Negative
Ben Barnes plays Tom Ward, whos just workin on the farm and dreaming of becoming a warrior when Master Gregory comes to collect his apprentice, according to, I guess the custom or the law of the day?
  Negative
Master Gregory tosses a bag of gold at Pop, and Olivia Williams Mam thats what they call her gives her boy a special necklace and says she always knew this day would come.
  Negative
OK, timeout.
  Neutral
Ben Barnes is .
  Neutral
He looks .
  Neutral
Isnt the kid in the books like ?
  Negative
Casting Barnes in the role of Tom undercuts the whole fantasy aspect of the tale.
  Negative
Of course his folks werent all that broken up about him leaving' they should have been thanking Master Gregory for finally getting their disappointment of a son out of the house.
  Negative
And if Tom is the seventh son of a seventh son, some of his brothers must be .
  Neutral
And yet Mam is a hot ish.
  Negative
What is happening in that house!
  Positive
We get the obligatory Medieval Karate Kid scenes with Tom learning from the wise and crotchety master, and countless battle sequences in which Master Gregory and Tom face off against CGI creatures.
  Negative
At times its pretty obvious the actors have been told to stare at a certain point because THATS where the dragon or the giant will appear.
  Negative
Bridges mumbles his lines as if hes a surfer just finishing a bowl of poi before catching some tasty waves.
  Negative
Moore goes for the classic Wicked Witch accent while the wind blows her hair as if shes doing a LOreal commercial.
  Neutral
Nearly every time we get the tease of these two great actors appearing in a scene together, Mother Malkin morphs into a dragon.
  Negative
What a waste of talent.
  Very negative
Seventh Son moves at a fairly quick pace and has a sense of humor about itself.
  Positive
That doesnt mean its thrilling, or funny.
  Positive
Just that its a quickly forgotten pile of junk.
