Just about everybody in Free Fire sustains multiple gunshot wounds, to the legs, the arms, the shoulder, the buttocks, you name it.
  Positive
When theyre shot, they scream in pain and they vow revenge  but time after time, they shake it off and they continue to limp about, firing their weapons at will until theyre hit again.
  Very negative
Maybe this was how paintball was invented.
  Neutral
Maybe one of the survivors of this carnage came up with the idea just before lapsing into a coma.

Director and co-writer Ben Wheatleys Free Fire is set in the s a few years before paintball was invented and is set almost entirely in a Boston warehouse where a cash-for-guns deal goes horribly wrong, igniting a movie-length shootout featuring about a dozen total Bad Guys and Even Worse Guys and one Badass Woman.
  Negative
And hey, theres little danger of anyone running out of weaponry or ammo, because theyre all in that warehouse for a gun exchange.
  Negative
How convenient!
  Neutral
This is a less clever Reservoir Dogs, with many an homage to the Tarantino classic, from the remote warehouse setting to the use of s pop music hello, Annies Song by John Denver to characters whoget shot dead in their tracks in mid-dialogue to the ending itself.
  Negative
But whereas Dogs occasionally left the blood-spattered warehouse for flashbacks that provided a back story and fleshed out some of the characters, Free Fire puts everybody in the room within about five minutes  and that's where we stay for the rest of the journey.
  Negative
Either youre in the mood for a series of gruesomely creative kills and lots of dark humor  or youre not.
  Negative
Either youll get a kick out of Academy Award winner Brie Larson becoming bloody and muddy and nasty as she shoots to kill and takes a few hits of her own  or you wont.
  Negative
Either youll crack up when a guy whos on fire grabs a nearby extinguisher and tries to use it on himself like a shower head  or 
Well.
  Neutral
You get the idea.
  Neutral
The cavernous, shuttered factory warehouse in Free Fire is set on the outskirts of Boston.
  Negative
Whatever they made here, nobody wants it any more, observes one character.
  Negative
The reveal of what was manufactured at the warehouse makes for an extended visual gag worthy of an old silent movie.
  Positive
Cillian Murphy is Chris and Sam Riley is Stevo.
  Positive
Theyre here to buy guns for the IRA.
  Neutral
Sharlto Copley is Vernon, Babou Ceesay is Martin and Jack Reynor is Harry.
  Negative
Theyve got the guns.
  Neutral
Armie Hammer is Ord and Brie Larson is Justine.
  Negative
Theyre the dealmakers whoput this thing together, from different angles Ord working with the gunrunners, Justine cozying up to the IRA bunch.
  Negative
Thats not everyone in the warehouse, but its a start.
  Negative
Suffice to say you can trust nobody, everyones a hard case and the moral compasses of the whole lot have long ago been shattered.
  Negative
Wheatley directs Free Fire as a clich-riddled B-movie that loves clich-riddled B-movies.
  Negative
Chuckling, smug characters get their comeuppance.
  Negative
Characters point guns at vulnerable enemies and pull the trigger  only to learn, yep, theyre out of ammo.
  Negative
The tables are turned, and turned again, to the point where loyalties are thrown out the window.
  Negative
Theres even a speck of romance between Cillians Chris and Larsons Justine, who somehow find time for a little awkward romantic banter between dishing out andor sustaining serious bloodshed.
  Negative
The semi-outrageous fashions and the aggressive facial hair mirror the times quite well.
  Positive
The dark warehouse, filled with potential props once the shooting begins, proves to be a video-game-worthy setting.
  Negative
And the ways in which Wheatley moves the excellent cast around the warehouse are impressively creative.
  Positive
Armie Hammer has a gift for deadpan humor, and it's put to great use here.
  Positive
Cillian Murphy is the closest thing to a hero or at least anti-hero we can root for in the movie.
  Neutral
Brie Larson is a gamer.
  Neutral
Her Justine has a sweet face and seems most interested in everyone getting out of the encounter alive  but theres more to Justine than meets the eye.
  Positive
Free Fire kills.
