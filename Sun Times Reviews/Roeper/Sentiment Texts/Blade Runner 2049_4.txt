When Blade Runner  fades to black after a perfect last shot, wait a minute before you turn your phone back on and you head for the exit and you return to the real world of the multiplex lobby and all that waits beyond.
  Negative
Take a moment to absorb and interpret and appreciate the vibrant and gorgeous and sometimes brutal and mind-bending and occasionally incomprehensible hallucinatory epic that is Blade Runner , which stands with the likes of The Godfather Part II and Terminator  and Aliens as a sequel worthy of the original classic.
  Very positive
Im not going to pretend I understood every last wrinkle of the plot or every action taken by every character.
  Negative
I have one, make that two, maybe even three big questions about why certain characters made certain choices in certain key moments.
  Positive
Not that knowing the answers  if indeed the definitive answers even exist  would necessarily mean Id have an even greater appreciation of the film.
  Positive
What I do know for certain is this: Director Denis Villeneuve Sicario, Arrival and cinematographer Roger Deakins who has become more famous for his  Oscar nominations and no wins than hed be with a couple of trophies on his mantle have teamed up to create one of the richest visual experiences of this or any other year.
  Negative
The sets are elaborate and magnificent and sometimes haunting.
  Positive
The CGI is brilliant and striking.
  Very positive
Every frame of this film is a feast for the eyes.
  Very positive
Ryan Gosling strikes just the right notes as the replicant hunter aka blade runner Officer K' Harrison Ford injects a layer of humanity and even wry humor into his portrayal of the jaded and surly Deckard' Robin Wright, Dave Bautista and Jared Leto, among others, excel in pivotal supporting roles, and Ana de Armas is a revelation as Officer Ks love interest, who isnt human but is arguably the most human character in the entire Blade Runner  universe.
  Positive
Blade Runner  is set some three decades after the events depicted in Ridley Scotts classic.
  Neutral
And yes, it would help if you see the original before diving into this one.
  Negative
Gosling is LAPD Officer KB-.

, aka K, a blade runner who tracks down and retires, aka kills, older model replicants that have gone off the grid.
  Very negative
Thing is, Officer K is himself a replicant, albeit a newer and more sophisticated model.
  Positive
He knows hes a replicant.
  Positive
He knows his childhood memories are implanted, because he was never actually a kid.
  Positive
Or was he?
  Neutral
Officer Ks superior, Lieutenant Joshi Robin Wright, treats Officer K as her favorite albeit a favorite pet of sorts, but his human colleagues on the force loathe this Skin Job, as one calls him, as do his neighbors.
  Very negative
His only companion is a holographic creation known as Joi de Armas, a flickering fantasy who cooks for K, changes from one sexy outfit into another in the blink of an eye and showers him with attention and concern.
  Negative
But theres more to Joi than meets the guy, so to speak.
  Negative
Ill leave it at that.
  Negative
On one of Ks missions, he unearths evidence a replicant gave birth some  years ago, a discovery that will break the world, as Joshi puts it.
  Negative
She orders K to track down the child  who would be just about Ks age by now  and erase all traces of its existence.
  Negative
Ah, but other forces are intent on finding this mysterious offspring as well.
  Neutral
Niander Wallace Leto, who talks like a cult leader and has creepy, marble-like eyes, runs the Wallace Corp., which took over the manufacturing of replicants from Tyrell Corp.
  Negative
Wallace cant manufacture enough replicants to fulfill his mad plan to take over the universe, so for years hes been trying to create replicants that can bear offspring, with no success.
  Negative
When Wallace gets word theres already such a being out there, he will stop at nothing to track it down.
  Negative
Thus the wheels are set in motion, sending Officer K on an unforgettable journey thats part futuristic noir mystery and part self-discovery.
  Positive
Blade Runner  has some visual nods to the rain-soaked, dreamlike, glowing neon Los Angeles of the original, but for the most part the world has become more desolate and more polluted, with shades of brown and gray and washed-out orange dominating.
  Negative
When the action moves from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, it feels as if were on an entirely different planet.
  Negative
As the Hans Zimmer score pounds us with one seat-rattling, ominous note after another, Officer Ks quest takes him to amazing places  some of them real, some of them memories, some of them taking place somewhere between reality and fantasy.
  Positive
When finally K tracks down Deckard, who hasnt been seen for  years, its a moment of pure movie geek heaven.
  Positive
From Indiana Jones to Star Wars to Blade Runner, Ford has built up an unmatchable resume of old-guy-reprising-iconic-characters.
  Negative
Gosling is a talented but tightly controlled actor' sometimes we can almost see the carefully honed mechanics of his technique.
  Positive
This makes him the perfect choice to play a replicant that just might be human.
  Positive
For much of this story, Officer K is in the dark about the truth  and we are too.
  Negative
When the light finally emerges, its quite a thing to behold.
  Positive
