Well, that was unnecessary.
  Negative
Twenty years after Independence Day stormed the summer box office and Will Smith announced himself as a major star in the making, we get Independence Day: Resurgence, which is nothing more than a clunky, clich-riddled alien invasion movie from the s B-movie playbook dressed up in st century special effects.

A sampling of actual lines from the film:
Yaaaah!
  Positive
Nobody else dies today!
  Negative
Aaaargh!
  Neutral
They got me!
  Positive
Yeeeeaaaaaah!
  Neutral
Is that an alien space gun?
  Neutral
Grrraaaaaaahhhh!
  Neutral

  Neutral
AAAAAAAAHHHH!
  Neutral
The Yaaaah!
  Neutral
type lines are indicative of what various pilots say as theyre firing on the enemy or getting hit by the enemy.
  Neutral
Theres a LOT of yelling the cockpits in this movie.
  Negative
After showing initial interest in the sequel, Smith dropped out.
  Positive
Perhaps the disaster that was After Earth turned him off to further sci-fi adventures for a while.
  Negative
Lucky Will.
  Neutral
They killed off his character, so not only does he avoid appearing in Resurgence, theres virtually no chance other than flashbacks of him showing up in the third chapter, which were threatened with at the end of this bomb.
  Very negative
Were told Smiths Captain Hiller was killed in a training exercise.
  Neutral
Gee, after saving the world?
  Neutral
Really!
  Neutral
Theres a cheesy painting of Captain Hiller hanging in a prominent spot in the White House, and his son Dylan Jessie T. Usher in a not-great performance is carrying on his legacy as a hotshot pilot.
  Negative
Independence Day: Resurgence is set in real time, some  years after the great alien war of , but in a parallel universe where all nations are united in peace, and there hasnt been a sign of any giant slimy invading insect-looking creatures in two decades.
  Negative
As for alums of the original who do appear in the sequel, a partial roster:
 Bill Pullman returns as now former President Whitmore, who is haunted by nightmares and calls himself a crazy old man even as he warns the aliens are returning.
  Negative
He even sports a Lettermanesque beard to let us know hes no longer a part of the mainstream.
  Negative
Jeff Goldblum is the best thing in the film, seemingly amusing himself with droll line readings, as David Levinson, who has become the director of the Earth Space Defense.
  Positive
Once the inevitable invasion occurs and major cities begin to fall, Levinson dryly notes, They like to take out the landmarks.
  Negative
Unfortunately, Judd Hirsch also returns and once again hams it up beyond belief as Davids meddling, annoying father, who calls people putz and schmuck, because, you know, hes Jewish.
  Very negative
Among the newbies: Liam Hemsworth is Jake Morrison, the obligatory Gifted But Cocky Pilot Who Breaks All the Rules.
  Negative
Maika Monroe is the presidents daughter, the obligatory Plucky Girlfriend Who Can Also Fly Jets.
  Negative
Nicholas Wright is Floyd, the obligatory Government Dweeb Who Eventually Picks Up a Gun.
  Negative
Oh, and Deobia Oparei is the warlord Dikembe Umbutu, who specializes in killing aliens with his twin machetes.
  Negative
All right, Ill admit thats a new one.
  Positive
All of these characters, and far too many more, are mired in a formulaic alien-invasion film that for all its massive D battle sequences and all its rousing music and all its attempts to make us care about these characters is one of the most uninvolving movies of the year.
  Negative
Everyone keeps talking about how the fate of the world is at stake, and we see the destruction of countless cities, meaning millions of lives have been lost  but its bloodless, from-a-distance destruction.
  Negative
Even when two of the younger characters witness the deaths of older relatives, I doubt therell be a moist eye in the house.
  Negative
The Resurgence blueprint calls for a scene in which characters have human, allegedly humorous andor touching moments' a scene in which characters plot strategy against the aliens' and a big action sequence in which its often difficult to tell the difference between the good-guy spaceships and the bad-guy spaceships.
  Negative
Rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat.
  Positive
Most of the performances in the film are as forgettable as the storyline and the special effects.
  Negative
Theres a lot of hugging and cheering and weeping and speechifying, but precious little of it rings true.
  Positive
We see CGI explosions and battles and we cut to the actors in the cockpit or command central or squinting up at the sky, and it just doesnt connect or resonate.
  Negative
Independence Day: Resurgence is directed by Roland Emmerich, whose credits include the first Independence Day, White House Down, , BC, and the  Godzilla.
  Negative
He knows how to do slick and bombastic.
  Positive
Five writers teamed up for the screenplay.
  Negative
This is a disaster by committee.
