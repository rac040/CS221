You know that person you meet whos so nice and smart and accommodating, whos almost predictably wonderful its kind of annoying at first  but then you stop resisting and realize its not an act, and you come to kinda love being around that individual?
  Positive
The Intern is the movie version of that person.
  Neutral
This is why you dont judge a movie by a high-concept poster that seems like a setup for a Funny or Die skit.
  Negative
You can almost hear the voice-over: Oscar winner Anne Hathaway is the boss, and Oscar winner Robert De Niro is HER INTERN!
  Very positive
Wait, what?
  Neutral
This fall, youll be majoring in FUN with The Intern!
  Negative
Ah, but with the reliable and consistent veteran writer-director Nancy Meyers Baby Boom, Father of the Bride, What Women Want, Somethings Gotta Give at the helm, and De Niro and Hathaway meshing in terrific fashion and delivering utterly charming performances, The Intern invites us to settle in fromthe start and practically throws a fleece blanket over our legs and asks us if wed like some popcorn.
  Negative
Its a lovely comfort movie, nestled softly in a cynicism-free zone.
  Positive
Lets be frank, the great De Niro sometimes phones it in some of these latter-years comedy roles he takes, but hes focused and likable and clearly having a good time playing Ben Whittaker, a -year-old widower and retired exec who was once the top sales and marketing guy with a company that produced phone books.
  Positive
This is the first of many, many, many reminders: Ben is old and comes from a different time.
  Positive
He sold phone books!
  Neutral
He wears a suit!
  Neutral
He has a briefcase!
  Positive
Hell need to be educated in the ways of Facebook!
  Negative
Still sound of body and quick of mind, Ben faces a daily battle to fill his days.
  Positive
He reads, he goes to the movies, he takes up tai chi and Mandarin, he hangs out at the local Starbucks, he visits his son and grandchildren on the West Coast  but hes still feeling as if hes benched from the game of life, until he sees a Plot Device, I mean, an ad for senior interns at a booming e-commerce startup company in Brooklyn, where hes lived his entire life.
  Very negative
As Ben says in his interview, hes beginning to worry hes not hip enough to live there any more.
  Negative
Anne Hathaway is Jules, who founded the company just  months ago and is now presiding over a wildly successful operation with more than  employees, nearly all of them young and cool and positioned at gleaming computers , ready to jump at a moments notice when the boss zips by on her hipster bicycle, and yes, I mean she actually rides her bike through the refurbished warehouse where they all work.
  Negative
One glaring omission from the workplace, and in fact from the entire movie: Where are the people of color?
  Negative
Jules doesnt want some old-guy intern getting in her way, but for reasons not entirely convincingly explained by the script, she has no choice in the matter.
  Negative
But Ben is so great, its only a matter of weeks before hes driving Jules around the city, getting to know her stay-at-home husband Anders Holm and their ridiculously adorable daughter JoJo Kushner and becoming a member of her inner circle.
  Positive
Ben also becomes a mentor to the other interns, literally and figuratively cleans up the office  and catches the eye of the on-site masseuse Rene Russo, looking spectacular at  who doles out back rubs and foot rubs to the employees, because thats how cool this company is.
  Neutral
What I dont get is why any company would ever let this guy retire, ever.
  Negative
Ben for president!
  Neutral
With some genuinely insightful dialogue, a number of truly funny bits of physical business, and small scenes allowing us to get know and like a half-dozen supporting players, The Intern grows us on from scene to scene, from moment to moment.
  Very positive
Meyers is also an expert at knowing when to tap the waterworks.
  Positive
Were just cruising along with Ben and Jules, enjoying the repartee as they go from strangers to friendly colleagues to great friends  and then some bad stuff happens, because even in a sunny movie like this a little rain must fall, and here we are with De Niro and Hathaway, watching them in an extended scene that is funny and touching and heartbreaking and just about perfect.
  Positive
