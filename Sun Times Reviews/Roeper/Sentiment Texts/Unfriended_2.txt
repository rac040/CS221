Earlier this year, the superb sitcom Modern Family told an entire episode from the viewpoint of Claires laptop as she waited for a flight home from OHare Airport.
  Negative
Sure, it was gimmicky, but it worked beautifully.
  Positive
For hardcore fans of the show such as yours truly, everything rang true, from Claires homepage to Mitchells experience with a new birthday present to Jays fumbling with technology.
  Negative
Which brings us to one of the major problems with Unfriended, a high school cyber-thriller told in real time through the desktop experiences of a popular teenage girl as she Skypes with her best friends on the one-year anniversary of the suicide of a girl they all knew.
  Negative
Whether its that Modern Family episode or the experimental-for-its-time Blair Witch Project or The Ring or even your typical clich-riddled teen horror film, we usually know a lot or at least know SOMETHING about the main characters before the plot sets in.
  Negative
In Unfriended, which drags and lags even with a running time of just  minutes, the main three female and three main male characters are nearly interchangeable in their personality traits and even their bland good looks, save for the one wisecracking, overweight guy who of course is the computer geek of the group.
  Very negative
Shelley Hennig is Blaire, a fresh-faced, popular, seemingly sweet girl who was once BFFs with Laura Barns Heather Sossaman, who took her own life after she was the subject of a humiliating video that went viral and led to numerous commenters telling her she should kill herself.
  Negative
Blaire is in the midst of a mildly racy Skype session with her boyfriend Mitch Moses Jacob Storm when their friends crash the call.
  Negative
The group eventually includes the preening, hot-tempered Adam Will Peltz' the aforementioned computer geek Ken Jacob Wysocki' and Jess Renee Olstead and Val Courtney Halverson, attractive, trash-talking girls, and thats about as much as we really get to know about those two.
  Negative
Director Levan Gabriadze captures the Social Media experience with pinpoint accuracy, from Skype calls toGoogle Chat to Instagram to YouTube, to Blaires cursor wandering to Spotify and then back to the group phone call and then over to a side chat with her boyfriend.
  Negative
Its all very accurate and eventually quite tedious.
  Negative
I never thought Id say this about a feature film, but Unfriended would probably be a little more effective on an iPad or a laptop.
  Negative
On the big screen, all the pointing and clicking and texting is headache-inducing.
  Negative
As Blaire and her friends give each other a hard time and flirt and tease and joke around, an uninvited guest joins the conversations.
  Negative
At first its a nuisance to the group, but then it becomes creepy, as the guest claims to be none other than Laura, whos been dead for more than a year, which usually makes it difficult to update ones status, post videos and join in on the Skype conversations.
  Negative
Blaire is sent to a website espousing the ludicrous belief the dead can haunt their tormentors via cyberspace  and YOU CANT ESCAPE UNLESS YOU ADMIT WRONGDOING.
  Negative
Could it be its really Laura playing mind games with them and threatening to end their lives?
  Negative
Blaire and her friends become increasingly unhinged as Laura, or whoever is playing this sick joke, reveals ugly truths about each of them and says shell kill anyone that tries to log off the conversation.
  Negative
And all the while, were on Blaires computer screen, watching these dimwits text and chat and scream and cry and generally behave like morons.
  Negative
You might well be asking, where are the parents?
  Neutral
Why dont these kids unplug their computers and get together in person?
  Negative
Well, they cant do that, for the same reason movie families never move out of obviously haunted houses after two days of ghostly moans in the middle of the night.
  Negative
If they exhibited a modicum of intelligence, it would kill the movie.
  Negative
The acting is actually pretty solid.
  Positive
These characters are never in the same room, so the performances amount to a collection of solo scenes.But these kids arent likable.
  Negative
Perhaps director Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves intended to create a Social Media Scream and a commentary on cyber-bullying, but Unfriended comes across as disdainful of millennials.
  Negative
An even bigger crime?
  Negative
Its a scary movie with nary a single scary moment.
