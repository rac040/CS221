Roughly  percent of A Ghost Story is disturbingly beautiful and spiritually challenging and stuck to me like a memory magnet.
  Positive
About  percent of A Ghost Story is maddeningly still and achingly self-conscious and just a little too pleased with itself.
  Negative
So here we are at three stars.
  Neutral
I have little doubt some of you will be enthralled and moved by writer-director David Lowerys small film about the vastness and eternity and mystery of life and the afterlife.
  Positive
Others will grow fidgety in their seats and might well walk out, lamenting the time they wasted on such pretentious nonsense.
  Negative
Im not exactly on the fence, but my leap of faith over the fence took me only a short distance past ambivalence.
  Negative
Heres the deal.
  Neutral
Casey Affleck and Rooney Mara, who previously co-starred in Lowerys Aint Them Bodies Saints, play C and M, respectively, a young couple living in a slightly weathered and smallish ranch home in rural Texas.
  Negative
Hes a musician  or perhaps aspiring musician would be a better description  who tinkers endlessly with his ethereal, New Age-y and quite frankly, irritating house compositions at home, his headphones shielding him from all outside distractions.
  Negative
Including, at times, M.
  Neutral
She has some sort of undefined day job that requires her to leave the house every morning, usually in a rush.
  Negative
Their union is intimate and loving but perhaps fraying at the edges.
  Positive
M is more irritated than charmed by the houses personality, which includes some pretty clear indications some sort of supernatural entity is floating about.
  Negative
C loves the place and wants to stay.
  Positive
In more ways than one, hed like things to stay just the way they are.
  Negative
Very early in this story, C is killed in a car accident that occurs just down the road from their house.
  Negative
At the hospital, a heartbroken M identifies the body and rushes out in despair.
  Negative
We stay in the morgue.
  Negative
Lowerys camera lingers on Cs sheet-covered body.
  Neutral
And then the sheet rises up, with two mournful black ovals where the eyes should be, as if C has donned the easiest and most elementary and most familiar Halloween get-up in modern history.
  Negative
From that moment forward, every moment in A Ghost Story is told from the point of view of C.
  Neutral
He walks out of the hospital deliberately away from what appears to be the classic light leading to the end of the tunnel and makes his way back to his house, where he becomes an invisible witness to events present, past and future.
  Negative
C stands mute and unseen as M grieves.
  Neutral
At one point M sits on the floor and consumes almost an entire pie from the center out in what appears to be one unbroken take that goes on and on.
  Negative
And on.
  Neutral
This is one of the moments when I was taken out of the film and found myself thinking, Look at that, Rooney Mara is eating a pie in real time.
  Negative
I wonder how many takes they did of THAT scene.
  Neutral
Days and weeks and months go by.
  Neutral
When M tries to move on with her life, at one point bringing home a man and engaging in drunken kissing, C flies into a rage and musters the ability to create a ruckus.
  Negative
Lowery does a masterful job of throwing curves at us.
  Positive
We go from a relatively traditional timeline to fast-forward, and then to super-fast forward, and then back in time more than a hundred years.
  Negative
We see the occupants who move into the house just after Ms departure, we see the house give way to a whole other world, and we see what the property was like in the mid-th century.
  Positive
All the while through this circular journey, C is a witness to events, but he doesnt seem to have any powers beyond the occasional ability to mess with the power or send objects flying.
  Negative
He cannot make himself known.
  Negative
He cannot change his own fate.
  Negative
He is in a limbo of sorts.
  Neutral
A Ghost Story draws from various Western religions and their beliefs about the nature of the afterlife, but it has elements of Eastern faiths and philosophies as well.
  Positive
It is a Big Picture film much more interested in providing open-ended scenarios than definitive answers.
  Negative
The premise and the framework of the story and the photography are much more memorable than the performances, and that feels mostly by design.
  Positive
Rooney does fine work with a limited character, while Affleck is shrouded in that sheet for the vast amount of his performance.
  Positive
You might argue theres much acting going on under that sheet.
  Negative
I would argue a body double could have stood in for Affleck for many a scene, and it would be virtually impossible to tell the difference.
  Negative
Theres only so much acting anyone can do while standing rigid and covered by a sheet.
  Negative
