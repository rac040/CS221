Carey Mulligans Mississippi farm wife in Mudbound.
  Negative
Just about everyone in directorco-writer Dee Rees searing and brutally effective s period piece Mudbound is living in some version of Hell on Earth.
  Negative
Jason Clarkes Henry McAllan, who has unceremoniously moved his wife and two young daughters from a relatively comfortable small-town life and a tidy little home to a borderline-barren stretch of farmland, is a strong and sturdy and mostly well-meaning man  but hes a stubborn cuss and he can be mean, and he isnt interested in bending the least bit to the changing times.
  Negative
He seems incapable of lightness or joy, and is oblivious to his wifes misery.
  Negative
Henrys wife Laura Carey Mulligan, in a devastatingly effective performance, an old maid of  when she married Henry, finds herself living in a ramshackle home on that farm, caring for her two daughters, working back-breaking days just to keep the household running, and longing for Saturdays, the one day when she can actually take a bath and wash off all the mud and grime and sweat and tears.
  Very negative
Then theres Henrys younger brother Jamie Garrett Hedlund, who was a dashing, life-of-the-the-party ladies man before World War II  but comes home as an alcoholic, broken man, unable to put the war behind him.
  Negative
The most miserable in every sense of the word member of the McAllan family is Henrys father Jonathan Banks, a dead-eyed racist with a black heart.
  Very negative
Youll find more charm in your average snake.
  Neutral
Yet for all their troubles and struggles and demons, the McAllans have it far better than the Jacksons, their sharecropper tenants.
  Negative
Crammed into a tiny shack, earning barely enough to keep food on the table, working from sunrise to sunset on the McAllans farm, the Jacksons dream of owning and farming their own patch of land  but in the here and now, theyre at the beck and call of the McAllans, night and day, day and night.
  Negative
Rob Morgan and Mary J. Blige deliver beautifully nuanced performances as Hap and Florence Jackson, the deeply spiritual and astonishingly resilient and fiercely protective parents.
  Very positive
The versatile actor Jason Mitchell Straight Outta Compton, Detroit is perhaps the films most compelling character: Ronsel, the oldest son of Hap and Florence, who serves with great distinction as a tank commander in World War II and is treated as a liberating hero overseas  only to return to a hometown where hes considered a rabble-rouser simply because he tries to exit the general store through the front door and not the back way.
  Negative
Set in that post-World War II Mississippi, which doesnt seem all that different from post-Civil War Mississippi, and adapted from Hillary Jordans novel of the same name, Mudbound unwinds the stories of those two families, and how their lives are inextricably, tragically linked.
  Negative
Bound by their wartime experiences  and by the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder theyre both experiencing, in a time when there wasnt a name for that condition and nobody wanted to hear about it  Jamie and Ronsel strike up a friendship that revolves around drinking and smoking cigarettes and opening up to one another.
  Negative
They take pains to conceal their friendship  after all, theyre living in a town where many of the so-called pillars of the community have white robes and hoods in their closets  but we feel an inevitable sense of dread about where things are heading.
  Negative
Meanwhile, Laura finds it hard to deny her chemistry with Jamie, who looks at her and talks to her in a way his big brother her husband has never done.
  Negative
Is it so wrong for her to have a moment or two of feeling wanted, of feeling respected, of feeling desired?
  Negative
In this world, it seems as if every moment of happiness, every glimpse of a better future, is fraught with dangerous consequences.
  Negative
If it sounds as if Mudbound is bleak  yes.
  Negative
It is.
  Neutral
As various characters tell the story from their point of view in voice-over, there are times when it seems as if theres almost no hope for anyone, from the most corrupt and evil SOBs to the damaged war heroes to the most sympathetic characters: Laura and Florence, the women who spend nearly every waking and dreaming moment worrying about and taking care of others.
  Negative
But redemption and hope eventually shine through here and there, and when that happens, its a beautiful thing.
  Positive
