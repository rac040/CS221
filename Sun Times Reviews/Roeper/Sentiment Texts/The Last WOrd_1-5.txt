Sitting through The Last Word is like wandering around an artificial flower store.
  Negative
Every once in a while, you come across something quite lovely, and it grabs your interest for just a moment  but upon closer inspection, its phony and its plastic and it doesnt pass the smell test.
  Positive
Shirley MacLaines brassy, commanding performance notwithstanding, this is a manipulative, contrived and at times borderline offensive comedyweeper with a number of cringe-inducing, off-putting elements.
  Negative
Based on director Mark Pellingtons opening montage, featuring dozens of photos of MacLaine as a little girl, through early glamour shots, to pics of hitting the town and triumphantly holding up awards, through her golden years, one might think this is going to be a biopic about a movie star not unlike the real Shirley MacLaine.
  Negative
No such luck.
  Neutral
MacLaines character is Harriet Lauler, a retired advertising executive occupying a large and tastefully appointed but empty save for the help house, while living a small and quiet and empty life.
  Negative
Harriet, we soon learn, deserves her solitude.
  Negative
Shes a hard and petty woman, a control freak who berates her gardener for not knowing the proper way to trim the hedges and elbows the cook out of the way in the kitchen.
  Negative
Shes been divorced for nearly two decades, she hasnt talked to her daughter in five years, she had a bitter departure from the advertising firm, and she doesnt have a friend in the world.
  Negative
None of this seems to bother Harriet  until a number of her friends and colleagues pass away, and Harriet reads their glowing obituaries, and she realizes she needs to shape her legacy NOW, or her obit is going to be short and sour.
  Very negative
Let the plausibility-stretching contrivances begin!
  Neutral
Harriet marches into the newspaper her firm has essentially kept afloat for decades and tells the editor shell need the services of the obituary writer for the next few weeks so the writer will do justice to Harriets memory.
  Negative
Right.
  Neutral
Because thats how it works.
  Positive
Amanda Seyfried gives a sweet and earnest performance as the Anne the obituary writer, who is only about  but has already worked this beat for eight years.
  Neutral
If you think were going to get some metaphors about how Anne herself needs to get out and LIVE instead of wasting her prime years writing about the deceased, ding-ding-ding-ding!
  Negative
Well played.
  Neutral
If the Harriet-Anne pairing wasnt bad enough, theirs is the most natural of instant relationships compared to the introduction of Brenda AnnJewel Lee Dixon, a young at-risk black girl.
  Negative
Harriet plucks Brenda out of a group of children at a community service and announces shell be mentoring Brenda, because itll look good in Harriets obituary.
  Negative
When we meet Brenda, she has a foul mouth, a temper problem and an attitude.
  Negative
Within days, shes holding hands with Harriet and Anne as they go on a road trip another forced plot development, cracking cute one-liners and proclaiming, Best day ever!
  Negative
when the three of them have a sleepover in a crummy motel.
  Neutral
Because their car broke down.
  Neutral
Because it needed to break down so we could have the sleepover scene.
  Negative
At times The Last Word veers from cloying to smug, e.g., the scenes involving a hipster radio station where various clichd characters spin only the coolest music on vinyl.
  Negative
Thomas Sadoski plays a DJprogram director whos so achingly mellow and laidback and comfortable with his coolness, even he acknowledges, That sounded kind of douche-y, after a particularly egocentric monologue about himself.
  Negative
