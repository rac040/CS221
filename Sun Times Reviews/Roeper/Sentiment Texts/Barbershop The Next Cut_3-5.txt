You dont expect a comedy to give you the chills, but the opening scene in Barbershop: The Next Cut did exactly that to me.
  Neutral
Its been a decade and a half since weve seen Ice Cubes Calvin Palmer, proprietor of the South Side barbershop where theres as much conversation as cutting on any given day.
  Negative
The neighborhood has fallen on hard times.
  Negative
Crime is up.
  Neutral
Gunshots and sirens are the soundtrack of the day.
  Positive
We see real-life news footage of recent tragedies and protests that have put Chicago in the national spotlight.
  Negative
Says Calvin to his beloved hometown:
Chicago, we need to talk.
  Neutral
Maybe its because Im from the south suburbs and Ive lived in the city for  years  and through the years Ive written many a column and done many a TV and radio show about violence in the city  but when Calvin talked about the violence has him rethinking his love affair with the city, it hit home, hard.
  Negative
Not only is Barbershop: The Next Cut one of the funniest movies in recent years, its a poignant and timely drama about the dilemma facing many parents in certain Chicago neighborhoods where crime is a fact of life: as much as you want to live where your family has lived for generations, as much as you dont want to be pushed out of your home, is it better for your children if you move the family elsewhere?
  Negative
Calvin and his wife Jennifer Jazsmin Lewis have done everything they can to make sure their son Jalen Michael Rainey Jr. concentrates on his studies and his basketball game while avoiding the gang influences lurking around every corner and even in the high school hallways.
  Negative
But when a model student from the neighborhood gets caught in the crossfire of another senseless exchange of gunfire, Calvin contemplates selling the barbershop and relocating his family and the business to the North Side.
  Negative
This is the serious side of Barbershop: The Next Cut.
  Positive
The issues are examined in appropriately somber tones, and even though The Next Cut was actually filmed in Atlanta, the discussions of violence and the scenes involving a nasty punk of a gang leader named Yummy well played by Tyga feel Chicago-authentic.
  Negative
Its impressive how well director Malcolm D. Lee working from a script by Kenya Barris and Tracy Oliver balances the serious material with the bawdy, freewheeling comedy pieces.
  Positive
Out of economic necessity, Calvins barbershop is now sharing space with the beauty shop run by Angie Regina Hall, so the stage is set every morning for gender and generational verbal warfare, with Nicki Minajs Draya leading the charge for the ladies while Cedric the Entertainers crusty old Eddie does the most of the talking from the guys point of view.
  Negative
Adding to the comedic mix: J.B. Smoove as the smooth-talking One Stop, who can and will sell you just about anything imaginable' Deon Cole as Dante, a daily regular customer who apparently has no place else to go, and Troy Garity as Isaac, perhaps the only white guy who regularly pops into the barbershop.
  Negative
At times The Next Cut is almost too ambitious in its attempt to cover myriad bases.
  Negative
In addition to the plot lines about Calvins family, violence in Chicago, Eddies claim he once cut the hair of a young Barack Obama and Anthony Andersons J.D. operating a food truck, theres a romantic triangle of sorts involving Rashad Common and his wife Terri Eve, and Draya, who has designs on Rashad.
  Negative
Its the least interesting and least effective story thread in the film.
  Negative
Just about everything else clicks, thanks in no small part to the wonderful performances from the deep cast.
  Positive
The father-son dynamic between Ice Cube and Michael Rainey Jr. is emotionally involving and almost heartbreaking at times.
  Positive
Common gives one of his best performances as Rashad, a good husband, a loving and a loyal friend.
  Very positive
Regina Hall is a rock as the independent, strong Angie, and Cedric hits another home run as the hilariously outspoken Eddie.
  Positive
Im not going to tell you if Eddie really did cut Barack Obamas hair back in the day, but when the truth is revealed, it makes for one hilarious epilogue.
  Positive
