Matthew McConaughey goes the full Bobby D, Johnny Depp, sacrificing-appearance-for-the-craft route in Gold, from the shiny balding pate to the prominent paunch to the crooked teeth to the utter lack of vanity in the performance.
  Negative
It could be argued undergoing such a transformation carries with it a certain amount of thespian vanity, i.e., Look at me!
  Positive
Im an ACTOR!
  Positive
Well good for him.
  Positive
And good for us, because its McConaugheys great big performance and the fine work by the outstanding cast that carries the day in Gold, an uneven and overlong but nonetheless entertaining American Dream saga that feels a little like The Treasure of the Sierra Madre crossed with The Wolf of Wall Street with some heavy seasoning of American Hustle on the side.
  Positive
Director Stephen Gaghan certainly knows how to do international intrigue.
  Positive
He wrote the screenplay for Traffic and directed Syriana,' two of the most authentic-feeling and powerful dramas of the s.
McConaughey plays Kenny Wells, a classic dreamer-schemer who grew up in Reno The Biggest Little City in the World in the shadow of his legendary father Craig T. Nelson and worked with dad at the Washoe Mining Corp., which was founded by his grandfather.
  Negative
By the late s, Kennys dad is long gone, the economy is in a hard downward spiral  and Kenny has been reduced to a desperate, hard-drinking, chain-smoking and perpetually sweat-soaked hustler, working out of a tavern, making Hail Mary sales calls to potential investors who cant wait for him to stop talking so they can turn him down.
  Negative
Only a few longtime employees and Kennys longtime girlfriend Kay Bryce Dallas Howard remain loyal to him and believe in him.
  Negative
Down to his last dream, Kenny makes his way to Indonesia and talks his way into a partnership withthe geologist Michael Accosta Edgar Ramirez, who was once thought to be a genius finding hot spots for minerals but has been on a cold streak of his own.
  Negative
With a terrific soundtrack and a couple of montages moving things along, Kenny and Michael experience a somewhat predictable rollercoaster ride of ups and downs.
  Positive
When it appears Washoe has hit the gold strike of the decade, slick New York investment types Corey Stoll and Bruce Greenwood, among others come knocking with bared teeth.
  Negative
Theyll put up with Kennys wild, drunken, rough-hewn ways if it means they can dig elbow-deep into the mountain of gold.
  Negative
Gold is one of the drinking-est movies in recent years.
  Positive
Kenny spends much of the film pouring drinks, downing drinks, throwing drinks against the wall, finding more to drink, passing out  and drinking again.
  Negative
At times it feels more like a portrait of an alcoholic than a continent-hopping adventure.
  Negative
McConaughey is so good playing a drunk you can practically smell the whiskey on his breath emanating from the screen  but when a movie is called Gold, we want to see more, well, gold.
  Positive
Gaghan and the production team do a credible job of plunging us into the s oh those boxy cars and questionable hairstyles, and of plunging us into Indonesia.
  Positive
The mining sequences and the dialogue about the industry ring true.
  Positive
McConaughey and Ramirez have an entertaining chemistry, with Kenny sometimes gushing about looking for gold and finding a friend and the stoic Michael telling him to take a step back with the corny emotions, even as his eyes betray his genuine affection for Kenny.
  Positive
Didnt care for the ending.
  Neutral
Didnt buy the ending.
  Neutral
It felt like OK Ill say it fools gold.
  Negative
The acting is the purest thing in Gold.
