If the North Koreans hired an inspired and gutsy director, gave him tens of millions of dollars for a budget and could somehow persuade Academy Award winners Colin Firth and Michael Caine to headline the cast, they might have come up with something like Kingsman: The Secret Service as an answer to The Interview.
  Negative
Thats a compliment to both films.
  Positive
Yes, this film is about a super-secret society of British agents with the self-appointed task of saving the world from evildoers  but its also a relentless, hard-core spoof of the old-school James Bond movies and their sexist attitudes and lunatic plots' self-aggrandizing billionaires who think they know whats best for the world' preachy environmentalists' a certain kind of American church that invokes the name of God while preaching hatred and intolerance, and it has two visual references to President Obama, one mildly offensive and the other so over-the-top tasteless it cant be taken seriously.
  Very negative
This is the craziest movie Ive seen in a long time, and I just sat through Jupiter Ascending and The Seventh Son last week.
  Negative
The difference between those two deadly bombs and Kingsman: The Secret Service is the latter never takes itself seriously, announcing itself as a hard-R parody from the get-go and keeping us in the joke throughout.
  Negative
On Day One of filming, they must have thrown away the moral compass and taken a group vow to splatter our sensibilities with stylish, gratuitous violence and one Wait, what?!

Looking trim and fit in his bespoke suits and oversized glasses, Colin Firth looks like hes playing the typical Colin Firth part as Harry Hart aka Galahad, a senior agent with the mysterious Kingsmen.
  Negative
Harry may look and sound as though he spends more time at headquarters than in the field, but when a band of thugs tests his mettle in a British pub, Harry locks the doors, turns around, takes out his umbrella  and goon blood and goon teeth start flying.
  Neutral
From that point forward, Kingsman: The Secret Service plays like an Austin Powers movie if it were directed by Kill Bill Vol.

Director Matthew Vaughn Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class has a ballet-dancer-with-a-machete style thats perfectly suited for a loose adaptation of the Mark Millar-Dave Gibbons spy comic book series.
  Negative
In the comic book, terrorists abduct Mark Hamill, an environmental scientist.
  Negative
In the movie, the real Mark Hamill plays the scientist, now dubbed Professor Arnold.
  Negative
Taron Egerton, who looks like the lead singer for a boy band and wears an unfortunate array of hats and caps through much of the film, is Eggsy Unwin, the obligatory smarttalentedundisciplined young buck recruited by Hart to become the next Kingsman.
  Very negative
After an entertaining but too-long series of sequences in which various candidates are weeded out, the real and really sick fun begins.
  Negative
Samuel L. Jackson plays Valentine, a megalomaniacal multi-billionaire who wears baseball caps tilted slightly sideways, speaks with a lisp and is convinced he can save the planet if only he can get various world leaders and global celebrities to sign on with the plan.
  Negative
Jackson seems to be sending up Russell Simmons, but the performance is so broad and so ridiculous that its hard to imagine Simmons being offended.
  Very negative
After seeing Jackson cameo as Nick Fury in so many Marvel Universe vehicles, its kind of awesome to see him sink his teeth into a Goldfinger-esque sendup.
  Negative
The Algerian dancer-actress Sofia Bout Ella is nothing short of spectacular as Gazelle, a slice-and-dice-em villain with two blade runner legs a la Oscar Pistorius.
  Negative
The scenes in which Gazelle flies through the air like a Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon character while cutting up her foes with all the cold efficiency of an EdgeCraft  Chefs Choice Premium Electric Food Slicer are fantastically and sometimes sickeningly mesmerizing.
  Positive
Kingsman is the kind of film that uses the K.C. and the Sunshine Band pop hit Give It Up as a counterpoint to scenes of mayhem that would feel at home in a particularly bloody episode of The Walking Dead.
  Negative
When Vaughn sends up the Bond tradition of the hero bedding a formerly haughty lass as a sexist bounty for his good deeds, he does with a scene that plays like a prologue to a porno reel.
  Negative
And somehow we get at least three references to Trading Places, which is not at all a British spy thriller.
  Negative
I say at least three because I cant be sure I didnt miss one amidst all the other onscreen madness.
  Negative
Firth is brilliant.
  Very positive
Hes playing a veteran super spy in a very violent but very silly movie, but even when Harry is explaining why theres a dead stuffed dog in his bathroom, Firth gives a disciplined, serious performance.
  Negative
Egerton does a capable job of keeping up with Firth, Caine and Jackson  no small feat.
  Positive
Relative newcomer Sophie Cookson does fine work as Roxy, a potential romantic interest for Eggsy.
  Positive
She should have been in more scenes.
