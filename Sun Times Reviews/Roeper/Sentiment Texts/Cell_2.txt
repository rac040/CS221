Our cell phones are turning us into zombies.
  Positive
The prolific and always movie- andor TV-adaptable Stephen King saw that coming a decade ago when he published a novel titled 'Cell,' which now has been turned into a movie starring John Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson, who previously appeared in the King adaptation , and you should rent that in lieu of purchasing this one on demand.
  Negative
Cusack stars as a King doppelganger of sorts  a New England-based graphic novelist named Clay Riddell who has just scored a big contract.
  Neutral
At Bostons Logan Airport, Clay calls his estranged wife Clark Sarullo to share the great news, and then he has a touching Facetime moment with his son Johnny Ethan Andrew Casto before his battery dies.
  Positive
Turns out thats the luckiest power outage in Clays life.
  Neutral
As Clay searches in vain for an available power outlet, a mysterious electromagnetic signal beams through the cell phones of everyone in the airport and beyond  instantly turning all those textingphoning humans into frothing-at-the-mouth zombies who will feast on the relatively small percentage of people who werent connected when the apocalyptic moment occurred.
  Negative
Let the gross-out violence and the chill-inducing creepiness begin.
  Neutral
Clay teams up with MBTA subway engineer Tom McCourt Jackson and his neighbor Alice Isabelle Fuhrman, as they try to puzzle out what the heck is happening as they shoot, bludgeon and otherwise kill off the possessed zombie population, aka phoners.
  Negative
Theres a hive mentality thing happening.
  Negative
The zombies flock together and mindlessly and slavishly follow a shadowy figure that appears in dreamsnightmares a la Freddie Krueger, and may or may not be a creation of Clays imagination.
  Negative
Ooh, social commentary!
  Positive
Im just not entirely sure what point is being made, but theres definitely some point-making going on here, people.
  Negative
The Cell is not a polished work of filmmaking.
  Negative
Some of the nighttime scenes are so poorly lit its difficult to tell whats happening.
  Negative
The editing is ragged and adds to the confusion.
  Negative
More than a few of the supporting performances are embarrassingly amateurish.
  Negative
On the plus side, we get Stacy Keach as some sort of preacher of the apocalypse, and a fantastically gruesome scene in which Cusack and Jackson torch an entire stadium filled with sleeping zombies, and a handful of genuinely frightening moments, and an ending that does not compromise.
  Negative
Also, even when John Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson are slumming it, theyre good fun.
  Positive
Not enough to save the movie, but enough to keep you interested when you click across this thing sometime in your future.
