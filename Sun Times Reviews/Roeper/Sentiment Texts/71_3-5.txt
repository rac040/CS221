The similarities pretty much end there.
  Positive
In one of the more impressive feature directing debuts in recent years, Yann Demange has fashioned a searing, remarkably realistic and unforgettable period piece thriller reminiscent of the docu-drama films of the great Paul Greengrass Captain Phillips, United , Bloody Sunday.
  Very positive
Jack OConnell, who spent most of Angelina Jolies World War II film Unbroken enduring unspeakable tortures at the hands of a sadistic Japanese POW camp commander, is once again playing a soldier whos banged up and battered to within an inch of his life  but this time it all happens over the course of one long and extremely harrowing night behind enemy lines during the Troubles in Northern Ireland in .
  Negative
Just  and looking younger, OConnell gives a stirring performance as Gary Hook, a green recruit with the British Army who is deployed to Belfast even though he and his mates are clearly far too inexperienced to navigate the tricky politics, the shifting motives of agents and double agents, and the increasingly agitated locals who greet their presence by throwing bags of feces and rocks at them.
  Negative
Once shots are fired and blood is spilled, the parallels between Northern Ireland in the early s and the Iraqs and Afghanistans of current day are clear without any heavy-handed symbolism from Demange and screenwriter Gregory Burke.
  Negative
Its chaos in the streets, with the British soldiers doing everything they can to not fire  until an Irish civilian shoots a Brit in the head, execution style, and a full-scale riot ensues.
  Negative
Gary barely escapes with his life, but his unit leaves him behind, either unwilling or unable to get to him.

  Positive
Members of the Provisional IRA construct a bomb in the back of a pub while Gary sits out front, awaiting his fate.
  Negative
An Irish couple find Gary near death, passed out on the street, and they debate whether to come to his aid or to keep on walking  because helping this man will put their own lives in imminent danger.
  Neutral
OConnell is brilliant at conveying Garys resourcefulness and bravery  but also the flat-out terror he feels when hes certain his life is about to end.
  Positive
This young man is no hero.
  Negative
He spends little or no time trying to understand the politics that put him in a uniform and led to strangers either wanting to cut him to pieces or risk their lives to save his.
  Negative
He just wants to go home.
  Positive
is filmed with such a realistic tone, at times it was a little difficult to follow what was happening in the nighttime fog of war.
  Positive
Once or twice, I found it hard to decipher the thick British and Irish accents.
  Negative
And Demange didnt do himself any favors by casting two main characters  one Irish, one British  who look alike, down to the facial hair.
  Negative
It just added to the mild confusion.
  Negative
Quibbles.
  Neutral
Frame by frame,   is one of those intense war thrillers where you know its fiction, you know its not a documentary, and yet every performance and every conflict feels true to the history and the events of the time.
