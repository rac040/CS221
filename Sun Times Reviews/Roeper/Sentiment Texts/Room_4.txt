Im not going to tell you Room is an easy film to digest.
  Neutral
Im not going to promise you wont want to walk out sometime during the first hour, especially if youre claustrophobic or youre a young mother.
  Negative
Im not going to tell you its the most entertaining movie of the year.
  Positive
I will tell you it just might be the most impressive piece of filmmaking Ive seen in , and it features a great lead performance by a rising star, a memorable supporting role by a familiar veteran  and one of the most amazing acting jobs by a child Ive ever seen.
  Very positive
When we talk about Room were going to have to talk about Room, and Im going to keep this relatively short  not because Room doesnt deserve a thousand words and many more, but because I want you to discover it for yourself.
  Negative
That is, if you havent read the beautiful and haunting novel by Emma Donoghue, who wrote the screenplay and did a magnificent job.
  Positive
Its little Jacks birthday.
  Neutral
He is !
  Positive
It is going to be a magical day.
  Positive
He cant wait for his mother to wake up so the birthday festivities can begin.
  Negative
Jack Jacob Tremblay tells us much of the story through his eyes.
  Positive
At first it sounds almost like a Dr. Seuss story, what with Jacks poetic shorthand to describe the world in which he lives  a world consisting of one room, with a skylight in the ceiling, a few pieces of furniture, a smallish refrigerator, a sink, an ancient portable television, a battered toilet, a grimy bathtub and a narrow bed.
  Negative
Room, as Jack calls it, is his world.
  Positive
Literally.
  Neutral
He has never set foot outside this tiny cell, which is actually a garden shed in the backyard of a man called Old Nick, who seven years ago kidnapped Ma when she was a teenager, imprisoned her in the soundproof shed and has raped her repeatedly since then.
  Negative
And thats how Jack came to be born.
  Positive
Ludicrous as that might sound, there have been true-life, horrific stories about young girls who are kept as prisoners in basements or sheds, tortured and raped by their captors  and in some cases even giving birth while in captivity.
  Negative
Room is fiction, but part of the reason it chills us to the bone is the knowledge such monsters exist in the real world.
  Neutral
Brie Larson plays Ma, and it is a raw, brave and unforgettable performance.
  Very positive
Here is a young woman who was snatched from the streets at age , and is now  and a mother, and has to cope with an insanely overwhelming situation that starts with raising a child and includes everything from coping with a horrible toothache to negotiating with her captor for the simplest things like batteries or food, to not losing her sanity every morning when she wakes up and every night when she tells a bedtime story to her son and tries to find a few hours sleep for herself.
  Negative
For five full years, Ma spins the longest fairy tale in human history to her son.
  Positive
She tells him their Room is pretty much the whole world, and everything they see on TV, from other people to animals to trees, is all made up.
  Positive
Old Nick Sean Bridges, the shadowy figure who visits in the deep of night, of course knows of Jacks existence, but its just fine by him that Jack always stays in the closet when Old Nick visits, bringing a few small items and then assaulting Ma once again.
  Negative
In the second half of Room, we meet other characters, including William H. Macy as Mas father and Joan Allen as her mother.
  Negative
Maybe its in flashbacks or in scenes taking place outside of the world of Room.
  Neutral
Youll see for yourself.
  Neutral
Suffice to say this part of the story is just as compelling and moving and intense as the first half.
  Very positive
Brie Larson is transcendent as Ma.
  Positive
She deserves a best actress nomination.
  Very positive
The wonderful Joan Allen is as good as shes ever been.
  Positive
Director Lenny Abrahamson and the tech artists on this film do an amazing job of creating a world within that room  making it seem oh so claustrophobic, but also letting us see it through Jacks eyes as this big wide world.
  Positive
And then theres Jacob Tremblay as Jack.
  Negative
To play someone who is so smart and so curious, so devoted to his mother and so creative, and yet so isolated and sheltered and incapable of understanding reality, is an enormous challenge for an actor.
  Positive
Maybe it worked to his advantage, and to ours, that he was so young he didnt realize how difficult that would be, and how pure and lasting his performance truly was.
  Negative
This is one of the best movies of the decade.
  Very positive
