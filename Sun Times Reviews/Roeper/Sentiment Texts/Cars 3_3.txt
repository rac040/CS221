Now that was a surprising win.
  Positive
No, Im not talking about any plot element in Cars .
  Neutral
Im talking about the fact I genuinely enjoyed it.
  Positive
Given my relatively mild affection for the entertaining but not particularly special Cars  and my disdain for the curiously convoluted and uninvolving Cars  , I didnt think the franchise had any gas left in the tank.
  Negative
and I was surprised there was even going to be a three-quel.
  Neutral
Even more surprising, and delightfully so: Cars  is a lovely, clever and entertaining generational tale with tons of heart, a simple and effective storyline, wonderful candy-colored visuals and winning voice work from the talented cast of returning regulars and welcome newcomers.
  Very positive
Owen Wilson brings his familiar laid-back drawl to Lightning McQueen, who has achieved legendary status as the undisputed king of the Piston Cup stock car circuit.
  Negative
Lightning racks up win after win on the circuit, routinely besting his peers  until the arrival of the new breed of high-tech, scientifically engineered racers, led by the black-painted Jackson Storm Armie Hammer, a cocky racing machine that can hit speeds of  mph and above, surpassing anything the old-school Lightning has ever achieved.
  Positive
How about a little refresher on the career of Lightning McQueen?
  Neutral
With the help of his loyal friends, his wonderful girlfriend car friend?
  Positive
Sal Bonnie Hunt and of course his crusty but lovable mentor Doc Hudson the late Paul Newman, Lightning became a champion thanks to his heart as much as his skill set.
  Negative
But now Doc is gone, and Lightning is an aging lion, and the new breed might just be too fast, too strong and too ruthless for him.
  Very negative
Is this the end of Lightning McQueen?
  Neutral
Also, has anyone else noticed this is basically the same setup we got in Rocky III?
  Negative
Lightning is given one last shot at the big time, courtesy of his new sponsor, Sterling a fantastically entertaining Nathan Fillion, a billionaire who has built a state-of-the-art training facility.
  Positive
Sterlings actually more interested in Lightning as a brand to sell dozens of products nice sense of humor there, Pixar!
  Very positive
than as a racer, but he agrees to fund Lightnings quest to return to racing, with one caveat: If Lightning doesnt win, he has to retire and become a full-time shill for Sterlings vast line of mud flaps and other car-related items.
  Negative
First-time feature director Brian Fee a former Pixar storyboard artist does a fine job of filling the screen with eye-popping animation and moving the story along  through the training sequences and a detour to a demolition derby might have benefited from just a bit tighter editing.
  Positive
Much of Cars  is about the passing of the torch, and the protg becoming the mentor.
  Positive
The Doc Hudson character voiced by the great Paul Newman who passed away in  actually has a fairly substantial role in flashbacks and flights-of-imagination sequences.
  Positive
When John Lasseter was filming the first Cars, he reportedly recorded hours upon hours of audio of Newman, including outtakes and off-the-cuff stories.
  Negative
Some of those lines were re-purposed for Cars .
  Negative
Meanwhile, Lightning comes to realize his spunky trainer Cruz Cristela Alonzo, very nice work might have some untapped potential of her own as a racer.
  Negative
He also relies on Docs old pal Smokey a perfectly voice-cast Chris Cooper for some pearls of wisdom.
  Positive
The mild satire of sports media coverage is spot-on, from the ubiquitous Bob Costas as Bob Cutlass and racing great and well-known NASCAR broadcaster Darrell Waltrip as Darrel Cartrip to Kerry Washington as Natalie Certain, an analyst who crunches the numbers and delivers precise percentage probabilities for various contenders just like you see on ESPN these days, e.g., Warriors: .
  Negative
percent likelihood of wrapping up the NBA Finals tonight.
  Negative
I still say Cars is the most difficult of all the Pixar staples to embrace.
  Negative
Theres only so much animation you can get out of motor vehicles, with their talking grilles and the eyeballs in the windshield, as opposed to toys that come to life, or an old man with a square head, or adorable fishies in the sea, or human-like creatures running around in an -year-old girls head.
  Negative
Maybe its not entirely fair to pit one Pixar franchise against others  but thats what happens when you create such an iconic roster of animated classics and near-classics.
  Neutral
Credit this group of cars, trucks, tractors, forklifts, et al., for being about as likable as can be.
  Negative
I just dont think were ever going to love them the way we love Nemo.
