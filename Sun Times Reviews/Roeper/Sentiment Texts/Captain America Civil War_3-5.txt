Lets say Captain America: Civil War opened in theaters in Gotham City and Metropolis right around the time Batman and Superman were about to go at it, and lets say Bruce Wayne hosted a star-studded benefit premiere, and Clark Kent covered it for the Daily Planet.
  Negative
When the lights went down and the storyline kicked in, Bruce Wayne would have been nodding in agreement with Tony Stark, while Clark Kent would have been thinking: I like the way Captain America thinks.
  Negative
As was the case with Batman vs. Superman, theres a major rift between iconic superheroes over collateral damage, i.e., the loss of innocent human lives that occurs during epic battles between the forces of good and evil.
  Negative
Captain America: Civil War is a lighter and much more crowded film, with so many superheroes zipping around and exchanging blows that at one point it felt like the Marvel Universe equivalent of one of those music awards show all-star jams where everyone from Paul McCartney to the Weeknd to Taylor Swift to Adele is onstage.
  Negative
And although theres no shortage of dark moments and violent moments, with personal tragedy motivating some characters to attempt to maim, cripple and kill, the overall tone is relatively light albeit in a PG- kind of way.
  Negative
Iron Man and Captain America and the Black Widow and the Scarlet Witch and Falcon and Hawkeye and Ant-Man, among others, often exchange quips even while in the midst of intense combat sequences.
  Positive
I guess they dont have to worry about saving their breath.
  Negative
Theres a LOT going on in this movie.
  Negative
A lot.
  Neutral
Kudos to co-directors Anthony and Joe Russo and the team of writers for juggling more than a dozen comic-book characters and nearly that many plot lines, and only occasionally getting us and by us I mean ME lost in the Geek Weeds.
  Negative
They also seem to realize a movie about superheroes can respect the genre while also taking pause once in a while to acknowledge the sheer giddy silliness of the whole endeavor.
  Positive
Civil War has a number of pop-culture punch lines, from a terribly green Spider-Man referencing a movie from the s to Tony Stark referencing a movie from the s to Ant-Man meeting Captain America for the first time and not even trying to contain his fan-boy glee.
  Negative
The internecine conflicts within the core group of Avengers are so entertaining and dramatically rich, its a relative letdown when the attention shifts to a generic madman villain Daniel Bruhl with a master plan.
  Positive
But even the obligatory master plan turns out to be different than the master plan we expected it to be.
  Negative
The battle lines in Civil War are drawn after an overseas mission led by Chris Evans Captain America inadvertently causes the death of a number of innocent civilians.
  Negative
Cap and his team, including Falcon Anthony Mackie and Scarlet Witch Elizabeth Olsen, are deeply affected by the tragedy  but they still firmly believe theyre saving far more lives than could be lost during their takedowns of terrorists.
  Negative
Its horrible and devastating when dozens are killed, but isnt that the better choice than hundreds, or even thousands, falling at the hands of the evildoers?
  Negative
Robert Downey Jr.s Tony Stark doesnt agree.
  Neutral
World-weary and emotionally exhausted from decades of seeing the carnage caused by weapons of mass destruction  both the type his company once manufactured and the superhuman kind  Tony agrees with U.S. Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross William Hurt and the leaders of  other nations, who have drafted a phone-book-thick accord giving the United Nations the power to decide if and when the Avengers will be called into action.
  Negative
Black Widow Scarlett Johansson and War Machine Don Cheadle side with Iron Man, but Captain America refuses to sign the accord.
  Negative
Next thing you know, Iron Man and Captain America are squaring off and picking teams as if theyre the captains of all-star superhero teams.
  Negative
Iron Man recruits a VERY young Peter ParkerSpider-Man lets put it this way: Marisa Tomei plays kindly old Aunt May.
  Negative
Captain America counters by adding Paul Rudds Ant-Man to the mix.
  Neutral
Civil War also finds room to introduce Chadwick Bosemans Black Panther, who, like Tom Hollands Spider-Man, will soon have a film of his own.
  Negative
Even with a running time nearing two and a half hours, Civil War keeps things moving along, with a solid balance of character soul-searching and kinetic action sequences.
  Positive
Some of the early action scenes are a bit TOO frantic, with so many jiggling camera moves and insanely rapid quick-cuts, one pictures Johansson, Downey et al. relaxing in their trailers or dubbing their lines while the stunt doubles and the CGI handle the visuals.
  Negative
Its nice to see further cracks in Captain Americas Mister Perfecto persona.
  Positive
When Tony StarkIron Man says hed like to punch Steve Rogers in the face, we can relate.
  Negative
It makes the Cap all the more interesting when the Cap makes some really bad decisions.
  Negative
The wonderful actors reprising their superhero roles are as excellent as youd expect them to be  although I did feel the mega-talented Downey might be getting just a tad restless inhabiting Tony StarkIron Man yet again.
  Very positive
Chadwick Boseman makes a strong first impression as Black Panther, as does Tom Holland as the latest Spider-Man.
  Positive
Forget the calendar and the spring cold.
  Neutral
Captain America: Civil War is a classic example of what the big-ticket summer movie experience is all about.
  Positive
