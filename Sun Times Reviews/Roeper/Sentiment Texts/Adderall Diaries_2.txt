Shaking off the headache-inducing viewing experience that is The Adderall Diaries, I was left thinking:
With the right material, Ed Harris and James Franco would be dynamite in a two-character movie or play.
  Negative
On a couple of occasions in this frenetic, precious and self-conscious hipster drama, Harris as the deeply flawed father and Franco as the tragically troubled son bare their fangs and verbally lunge at each other with a chilling ferocity so raw and powerful its fantastically uncomfortable to watch.
  Negative
The actors bring out the finest in each other as they punch and counter-punch vastly different memories of horrific incidents from the past.
  Positive
Its great stuff.
  Positive
Unfortunately, much of the rest of the The Adderall Diaries is overwrought, convoluted and irritating.
  Very negative
a piece for Vulture, Elliott wrote he was grateful his bookwas turned into a movie, primarily because he needed the money, and he understands films will always take license with true stories, but he rattles off a number of major  and negative  differences between his works and the film.
  Neutral
Francos portrayal of Stephen dives headfirst into the playbook of clichd Hollywood portrayals of troubled writers.
  Negative
Stephen lives in a giant, messy apartment, he has I-dont-give-a-bleep facial hair, he sports numerous tattoos, hes addicted to beautiful women and dangerous drugs and, yes, of course he has a motorcycle.
  Negative
In Stephens memoir, he writes extensively about the abuse he suffered at the hands of his late father, Neil  but then Stephens supposedly dead dad shows up, claiming Stephens writings are the stuff of fiction.
  Negative
Amber Heards Lana, a New York Times reporter whos just as casually beautiful as Stephen and nearly as messed-up, gets one look at Stephens motorcycle and decides theyll be dating now, thank you very much.
  Positive
Let the risqu sex games and the wild nights and the deep conversations begin!
  Positive
Not to say New York Times reporters cant be drop-dead gorgeous and crazy and covered with torso tattoos, but Im gonna go out on a limb here and say Amber Heard does not deliver the most convincing portrayal of a New York Times reporter ever captured on film.
  Negative
As Stephen wrestles with what percentage of his memories are based in real events and what percentage are pure fabrication, his exasperated agent Cynthia Nixon points out his whole making-things-up thing could, you know, kill his career.
  Negative
Stephen is convinced hell find redemption writing a book about the sensational trial of a man Christian Slater accused of murdering his ex-wife.
  Negative
It could be his In Cold Blood, he proclaims with no shred of modesty.
  Negative
What with Stephens shifting memories, his intense confrontations with his father, the flashback scenes to a teenage Stephen getting into trouble, Stephens self-destructive behavior, the unconvincing romance with the New York Times reporter and the murder trial, The Adderall Diaries comes across as an incomplete jumble of colliding plot lines.
  Negative
But if it leads to Harris and Franco teaming up for a better movie or a stage production, Ill take it.
  Negative
