Holocaust deniers are infinitely more shameful but just as loony as card-carrying members of the Flat Earth Society or delusional fringe types still maintaining NASA faked the moon landing on a soundstage.
  Negative
It seems offensively absurd a respected author and professor of Jewish history would have to go to court to prove the Holocaust happened  but thats just what happened to Deborah Lipstadt, who was sued by an infamous Holocaust denier who claimed HIS reputation had been ruined because Lipstadts book identified him as anti-Semitic, a Hitler sympathizer and a Nazi Party apologist.
  Negative
That trial is the centerpiece of Denial, a powerful but often stilted drama bolstered by two great performances from accomplished actors and nearly sunk by an unfortunately and surprisingly off-key performance from another fine actor.
  Negative
Lets start with the misfire first.
  Negative
The normally wonderful Rachel Weisz pierces the eardrums with a shaky and flat performance as Deborah Lipstadt.
  Negative
Her New York accent is so thick it wouldnt fly in a Saturday Night Live skit.
  Negative
Onward.
  Neutral
In the mid-s, Deborah is living a busy life as a Holocaust studies professor at Emory University in Atlanta.
  Negative
An accomplished author, Deborah is giving a talk about her latest book, 'Denying the Holocaust,' to a packed house when the British historian and well-known Holocaust deniershowboat David Irving Timothy Spall loudly interrupts her, quoting passages from her own book about him and waving , over his head, offering it as reward to anyone who can prove beyond a shadow of a doubt the Holocaust actually occurred.
  Negative
It gets worse.
  Negative
Irving sues Deborah and her publisher, Penguin Books, claiming Deborahs passages about him in 'Denying the Holocaust'have destroyed his reputation and have prevented him from making a living.
  Negative
Under British libel laws, the onus is on Deborah to prove her statements about Irving are true  that Irving is racist, Irving is anti-Semitic, Irving willfully distorted the historical record and Irving knows the Holocaust occurred but has deliberately lied about it for decades.
  Negative
For such an accomplished, learned person, Deborah seems flustered and at times flies off the handle when she learns about the workings of the British legal system.
  Negative
She swoons in the presence of the solicitor Anthony Julius Andrew Scott, a handsome charmer who represented Princess Diana in her divorce case  but shes dumbfounded when she learns Anthony will only prepare her case, and the barrister Richard Rampton Tom Wilkinson will actually represent her in court.
  Positive
Also, the defense strategy is for Deborah not to testify.
  Negative
And for that matter, they wont be calling any Holocaust survivors to the stand either.
  Negative
While Ill leave the reasoning behind these decisions unexplained so as not to give too much away, suffice to say the absence of the heroine and of the real victims of Irvings hateful crusade from key courtroom scenes makes for relatively muted trial fireworks.
  Negative
Wilkinson gives the most complete performance in the film as Rampton, who refuses to get too emotionally involved, even during a visit to Auschwitz to gather evidence.
  Positive
Always the proper Brit, Rampton is quick to offer red wine in plastic cups and small sandwiches to guests in his office, but he always seems preoccupied with the details of the case because he IS always preoccupied with the details of the case.
  Negative
Timothy Spall is a snaggletoothed snake charmer as David Irving.
  Positive
Irving is an appalling human being and he is on the wrong side of history in a way that should shame his descendants for generations, but the man is not a fool, and he is dangerous because there are some who are all too willing to believe his supposedly well-researched garbage.
  Very negative
Spall does a magnificent job of portraying an obsessed and slick con artist who at his core is a monster in a tailored suit.
  Positive
As directed by Mick Jackson The Bodyguard, Volcano and scripted by David Hare The Hours, The Reader, Denial is so stagey at times we half-expect the actors to step into a spotlight and address us directly.
  Negative
Despite the drawbacks, the power of the story shines through.
  Positive
