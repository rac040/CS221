This is a thing now for Disney: Dust off the time-honored playbook of animated and hugely profitable classics such as The Jungle Book and Cinderella and now Beauty and the Beast, take advantage of all the CGI and motion capture technology available  and presto!
  Very positive
Youve got a live action reanimation, suitable for audiences the world over and capable of bringing in hundreds upon hundreds of millions of dollars.
  Positive
Be their guest, be their guest, be their guest.
  Positive
Bill Condons take on Beauty and the Beast is almost overwhelmingly lavish, beautifully staged and performed with exquisite timing and grace by the outstanding cast, many whom are seen on-camera only in brief moments, given theyre playing household objects and furniture and the like.
  Positive
If you dont have an IMDB-level knowledge of the casting prior to entering the theater, its kind of fun when you find out that, yep, that was Emma Thompson in that role, and oh, so it was Stanley Tucci playing that part, etc.
  Negative
Although a few new songs have been added and the screenplay does include a few updated touches, including the controversial exclusively gay moment as director Condon referred to it in an interview that spurred quite the dust-up, the screenplay by Steven Chbosky and Evan Spilotopoulous remains quite faithful to the  animated version of the classic fairy tale.
  Positive
Of course, the beloved hit tunes are prominently featured  everything from Belle to Gaston to Be Our Guest to Beauty and the Beast.
  Negative
And while Emma Watson Belle and Emma Thompson Mrs. Potts wont make your forget about Paige OHara and Angela Lansbury, respectively, they and the rest of the cast do a fine job performing songs youll find yourself humming days after leaving the theater.
  Negative
Watson Hermione from the Harry Potter movies is all pluck and spunk and sass and smarts and fierce independence as Belle, who is considered a weirdo in her village in France because she always has her nose in a book and she doesnt suffer fools.
  Negative
That latter trait is a real bummer for the dashing but dim-witted and narcissistic Gaston Luke Evans, who is hell-bent on marrying Belle even though she tells him again and again and AGAIN shes not interested.
  Negative
The casting of Evans is perfect.
  Positive
Not only does the guy look like a cartoon leading man come to life, hes terrific at making himself the butt of the joke.
  Negative
I loved the tone and scope of the early production number, Belle, when we meet our heroine and learn of her lot in life.
  Positive
Its as if were watching the most expensive, the biggest, the most ambitious Broadway musical ever made.
  Positive
Whether were looking at massive sets or CGI or a combination, the end result is spectacular.
  Positive
Once Belle is in the clutches of the Beast Dan Stevens from Downton Abbey, we settle in for the familiar story  with all its romance and fantasy, and yes, more than a little bit of silliness.
  Negative
Hes a BEAST.
  Neutral
He has HORNS AND HOOVES.
  Negative
I dont want to sound looks-ist, but even as we come to understand why Belle would have genuine affection for the big fella, its a stretch even for a fairy tale to believe shed fall in love with him.
  Negative
Because hes, you know, a BEAST.
  Negative
With HORNS AND HOOVES.
  Neutral
Think of the children!
  Positive
Cutting-edge motion picture trickery allows for some pretty cool CGI versions of the elegant and sweet French candlestick Lumiere Ewan McGregor' the blustery and fussy but big-hearted clock called Cogsworth Ian McKellan' the motherly teapot Mrs. Potts Emma Thompson, and the wardrobe with the opera singers pipes Audra McDonald.
  Negative
Watson is well cast as Belle, who even when she is being held captive in a castle comes across as an independent spirit.
  Positive
Stevens has kind of Dark Knight thing going with his booming voice it sounds electronically altered and of course is essentially playing an animated character in the beast, but his eyes convey his humanity, and theres some wonderful self-deprecating humor as the Beast becomes less of a monster and more of a man.
  Negative
As for the exclusively gay moment involving Josh Gads Le Fou, it happens late in the film and it takes up about five seconds of screen time  but if you dont think Le Fou has had a serious thing for Gaston all along even prior to this version of the story, you were missing some gigantic blinking neon indications, my friend.
  Negative
