Some movies swing for the fences  and either strike out in big-budget, spectacular fashion, or hit a home run.
  Negative
Others, such as the smart, lovely, funny, occasionally edgy, slightly cynical and ultimately heart-tugging Other People, are the equivalent of the singles hitter in baseball  content to accumulate one small and legitimate successful moment after another.
  Positive
Cheers to that.
  Neutral
Working from the time-honored foundation of Write what you know, which can either be a tiresome trope or the springboard for a fresh and original voice depending on the talent level involved, writer-director Chris Kelly Saturday Night Live, Funny or Die, The Onion News Network is clearly in the latter category with this nimble slice of life-and-death about an almost-successful New York City comedy writer who returns home to Sacramento to help care for his terminally ill mother.
  Negative
If that sounds like the classic recipe for a modern-day indie film, well, yes, it is.
  Positive
But the fact Kelly leans so heavily on Trains Drops of Jupiter  a solid mainstream ballad but pretty much the antithesis of all things indie  and uses it to great effect throughout the film is just one indication this isnt going to be a pretentious, self-satisfied journey.
  Negative
Jesse Plemons, who was terrific as the hapless Landry on Friday Night Lights and took it to the next level as the casually chilling psychopath Todd Alquist on the final season of Breaking Bad, is a deadpan delight as the -year-old David, a gay writer of some talent who puts his career on hold and travels cross country to be with his dying mother Joanne Molly Shannon and his Sundance-friendly dysfunctional family, played by a roster of Oh I always liked him her, whats his her name?
  Positive
actors, including:
Bradley Whitford from The West Wing as Davids conservative father Norman, who still hasnt acknowledged Davids sexuality some  years after David came out to the family.
  Negative
Paul Dooley from Breaking Away and Sixteen Candles and a million other roles, and June Squibb, most recently from Nebraska, as Davids maternal grandparents, who could have been RV-driving clichs if not for Kellys elevated writing and the quietly powerful acting by the two veteran character actors.
  Neutral
Zach Woods The Office in a very funny and well-played turn as Davids ex-boyfriend Paul, who goes along with the ruse theyre still together for the benefit of Davids mother.
  Positive
Plemons beautifully plays a character who absolutely loves his mother and is devastated by her illness and wants to be there for her every step of the way  but lets remember, hes just  and hes coping with the breakup of a five-year relationship and some career setbacks, and so yes, hes a little self-involved.
  Positive
To the credit of the screenplay and the direction, and Plemons fine acting, we feel for this guy even when hes feeling sorry for himself.
  Positive
I loved Molly Shannons work as Joanne, who has a ton of spark and spirit, but is never one of those clichd Movie Cancer Moms who acts like a saint and is always telling her children to love one another and her husband not to be sad forever without her.
  Positive
In fact, Joanne HATES what her illness is doing to her, she is terrified by what awaits her, and she sometimes rages against the fates in the way real people do when dealt such unfair cards.
  Negative
Its a performance worthy of a best supporting actress nomination.
  Positive
Not that Shannon isnt funny as heck to boot' in a scene in New York City when Joanne is called onstage for an improv bit, her walk is a combo platter of Shannons guest spot on Seinfeld as Elaines co-worker who walks without moving her arms, and her Mary Katherine Gallagher character from SNL.
  Negative
Other People also finds time and space to explore Davids relationships with his younger sisters Maude Apatow and Madisen Beaty, both wonderful, and his friendship with a buddy John Early whose own mother has passed away.
  Positive
We know were going to get a scene where David confronts his father.
  Negative
We know were going to get a scene where David and his ex have some closure.
  Negative
We know those damn Drops of Jupiter are going to fall one more time.
  Negative
And yet we continue to be surprised at the skill level of every at-bat.
  Positive
Sometimes a whole bunch of singles add up to a home run.
  Negative
