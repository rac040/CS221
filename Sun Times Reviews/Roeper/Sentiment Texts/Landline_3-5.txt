Its not easy to warm up to the Jacobs family.

Sure, theyre all smart and quick-witted and interesting' theyre also loud and whiny and duplicitous, and sometimes just plain unpleasant to be around.

  Positive
Robespierre and co-writer Elisabeth Holm have a keen ear for the rhythms of dialogue and the way family members interact with one another, whether its the casual cruelty a teenage daughter can inflict upon her parents' how a longtime married couple can be in the same room with one another and yet seem a thousand miles apart, or the comfortable and sometimes terrifyingly dull routine of a young couple already long past the point of giddy romance and constant lust.
