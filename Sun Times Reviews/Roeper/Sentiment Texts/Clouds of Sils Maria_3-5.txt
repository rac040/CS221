BY RICHARD ROEPER  SUN-TIMES MOVIE COLUMNIST
It wouldnt be fair to call Clouds of Sils Maria a comeback vehicle for Kristen Stewart because the Twilight heroine and tabloid favorite hasnt really gone anywhere.
  Negative
But Stewarts blazing, blunt, pitch-perfect performance in this film serves as a reminder shes actually one of the best actresses of her generation.
  Very positive
Look at it this way.
  Neutral
Stewart shares the screen with the great Juliette Binoche in scene after scene, and holds her own every step of the way.
  Positive
In this gorgeous and striking and sometimes brutally insightful work from writer-director Olivier Assayas, Stewart plays Valentine, the preternaturally composed personal assistant to Binoches Maria, one of the worlds great movie stars.
  Very positive
Maria is approaching a certain age and she isnt particularly thrilled about that.
  Negative
As if any woman, or man, is giddy over the prospect of turning the corner past .
  Positive
We open in a train zipping its way to Zurich, where Maria will accept a lifetime achievement award for one Wilhelm Melchior, a reclusive playwright and filmmaker who gave Maria her first big break some two decades previous.
  Negative
Melchior cast Maria as a young woman who manipulates a woman twice her age to tragic results in a play and then the movie adaptation called Maloja Snake, and the role made Maria a star.
  Negative
Now theres talk of a remake  with a young hotshot director named Klaus Lars Eidinger looking to cast Maria in the role of the older woman.
  Neutral
Maria is equal parts flattered and horrified by this development.
  Negative
Sidebar: the Maloja Snake, so Ive learned, is the term for a thick, white cloud bank that winds through the Alps.
  Negative
Valetine multi-tasks while Maria has a contentious telephone conversation with the attorney for her soon-to-be ex-husband.
  Neutral
We immediately get a feel for the dynamic between these two women.
  Negative
Yes, Maria is a major movie star and nearly twice Valentines age, but Valentine is as much the voice of reason and almost an older sibling figure as she is a personal assistant.
  Positive
One gets the sense Valentine is one of the few people in Marias life who speaks freely and openly to the great, internationally renowned actress.
  Very positive
If the notion of playing the older woman in a remake of Maloja Snake isnt daunting enough, Maria is shaken to the core by Wilhelms unexpected death.
  Negative
Everywhere she turns, she sees her own mortality.
  Negative
Clouds of Sils Maria becomes a movie within a movie within a movie, as Maria agonizes over whether to play that older woman, even though she still FEELS like the younger woman in the story.
  Negative
Klaus has cast an American action movie superstar named Jo-Ann Chloe Grace Moretz in the role of the younger woman.
  Negative
Valentine tells Maria she HAS to take the part.
  Positive
Not only is Klaus perhaps the best director of his generation, says Valentine' Jo-Ann is also blazingly talented, despite her reputation as a self-destructive hot mess.
  Negative
Assayas and his director of photography Yorick Le Saux give us some overwhelmingly beautiful scenes set high in the Swiss Alps  and some expertly choreographed interiors in which Valentine and Maria run lines from the film that have deep and cutting parallels to their own relationship.
  Positive
At times its as if were watching Whos Afraid of All About Eve.
  Negative
The dialogue, while occasionally a bit too heavy-handed, is often razor-sharp and leaves a mark.
  Negative
In addition to the superb work from Binoche and Stewart, were treated to a stellar performance by Chloe Grace Moretz as Jo-Ann, a whip-smart, calculating young star who shatters the preconceived, Googled stereotypes Maria holds of her, and wins her over with immense and intense flattery.
  Positive
Later, when Maria tries to give Jo-Ann an acting note, she quickly learns Jo-Ann is no pushover.
  Negative
Its rare when a film has three robust, deeply drawn female characters  and Binoche, Moretz and Stewart deliver memorable, nuanced performances.
  Positive
Clouds of Sils Maria is an expertly filmed insiders look at the film business, the trappings of fame and the unstoppable, sometimes bone-chilling march of time.
  Negative
Its complex and wickedly funny and dark, and it features the best ensemble acting of any film Ive seen so far this year.
  Very positive
