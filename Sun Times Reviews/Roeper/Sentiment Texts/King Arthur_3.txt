In its finest moments, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is swift and clever and exhilarating.
  Positive
At its low points, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword plays like a cheesy B-movie, with ridiculous monsters and unintentionally laugh-inducing moments.
  Negative
Add the four-star rating for some scenes to the one-star rating for other scenes, divide by two and presto!
  Negative
Heres your three-star review.
  Neutral
And they told me when I entered the movie reviewing game there wouldnt be any math.
  Negative
Harumph.
  Neutral
Director Guy Ritchie, he of the signature quick cuts and dazzle-edits and dark humor Snatch, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Sherlock Holmes gives a unique spin to the umpteenth telling of the King Arthur legend.
  Positive
This is essentially a superhero origins story, with our man Art Charlie Hunnam growing up as a hardscrabble nobody who is tapped for greatness, resists the calling for as long as possible and then finally accepts his destiny.
  Positive
While caked in mud and blood and sometimes moving in slow motion, natch.
  Negative
In an extended prologue, the wise and noble and just King Uther Eric Bana rules England with a strong but benevolent hand.
  Positive
Uthers brother Vortigern Jude Law, consumed with envy and obsessed with power, orchestrates a violent coup, spilling the blood of myriad family members.
  Negative
Uthers toddler son Arthur is placed on a boat just in time to escape the wrath of Vortigern.
  Negative
The boat miraculously makes it all the way to the shores of the bustling urban center known as Londinium.
  Positive
Arthur is rescued by a group of prostitutes who raise him in their brothel.
  Negative
A couple of decades later, Arthur practically runs the streets of Londinium.
  Negative
He exacts justice on those who deserve it, he builds up considerable coffers  and hes become such a physical force that even visiting marauding Vikings bend to his will.
  Positive
Meanwhile, back at the palace, the evil Vortigern grows ever more powerful, thanks in great part to a devils bargain he has struck up with a very creepy and very slimy sewer-dwelling beast thats a disturbing combination of octopus and three human-like beasts.
  Negative
This is one of those B-movie sequences previously referenced.
  Neutral
As Voritgern puts it, he doesnt care if the people hate him  as long as they fear him as well.
  Negative
Hes stark-raving-mad drunk with power.
  Positive
It takes a while  in fact a little too long  for the moment when Arthur puts his hands on the sword in the stone, gives it a mighty yank, and becomes an instant, albeit very reluctant, legend, and the last best hope for the people to rise up against the ruthless Vortigern.
  Negative
Director Ritchie paces much of the second act like a heist movie, with some fantastic, fast-paced montages of Arthur and his team plotting and carrying out uprisings against King Vortigern.
  Positive
Terrific work by all playing Arthurs comrades in arms, including Djimon Hounsou as Bedivere' Aidan Gillen as Bill' Kingsley Ben-Adir as Wet Stick' and Astrid Berges-Frisbey as the Mage, a mysterious sorceress with an impressive array of magical powers.
  Positive
Jude Law, dressed like Mick Jagger circa , is all sneers and primal howls as Vortigern.
  Negative
Its an up-and-down performance from a fine actor.
  Positive
For all of Vortigerns heinous deeds  and theyre about as heinous as heinous can get  he seems overmatched against Arthur from the get-go.
  Negative
Charlie Hunnam continues his movie-star ascent with a strong performance as the conflicted Arthur, who will risk all to save his friends and family, but refuses to accept his path as the peoples king until theres absolutely no way he CANT acknowledge his destiny.
  Neutral
Director Ritchie and the set design and CGI teams create some spectacular tableaus, from beautiful countryside long shots to some intricately choreographed battle sequences at the kings castle and in the labyrinthine streets of Londinium.
  Positive
In fact King Arthur works best when the focus is on the bonds forged between Arthur and his future knights, the battles between the rebel forces and the obligatory faceless henchmen, and even the slightly sexual tension between Arthur and the rather humorless but enticing Mage.
  Positive
The stuff with the Octo-Person Creature and gigantic reptiles and a CGI swordsman that talks like Darth Vader?
  Negative
Eh.Ill take the exploits of the mythical man over the booming magic show every time.
  Neutral
