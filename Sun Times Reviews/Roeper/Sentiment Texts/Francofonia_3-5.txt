In the lush, stunning, sometimes trippy and always fascinating Francofonia, the brilliant Russian writer-director AlexanderSokurov asks:
Who would we be without museums?
  Positive
I dont know  Friends of the Park, maybe?
  Negative
Excuse my cynicism over the shortsighted and wrongheaded but apparently successful effort to stop the Lucas Museum from building on Chicagos lakefront.
  Negative
Of course we still have the Art Institute, the Field Museum, the Museum of Contemporary Art and so many other invaluable homes to priceless treasures  but even the most loyal Chicago art connoisseur will acknowledge the Louvre in Paris is the Museum of all Museums, and that everyone who can afford to make the journey should do so at least once in a lifetime.

It took me a week to recover from the blisters I sustained on my first visit, when I just walked and walked and walked until there was no more walking to be done.
  Very negative
In Francofonia, Sokurov delivers a passionate love poem to the Louvre and its nearly endless artistic riches by focusing on the collaboration between Louvre director Jacques Jaujard played by Louis-Do de Lencquesaing in imagined re-creation scenes and the German officer Count Franz Wolff-Metternich Benjamin Utzerath, who during World War II worked together to ensure the Louvres artworks wouldnt be sent to the Nazis in Germany.
  Negative
Sokurov seems to have a love-hate relationship with modern art, but he embraces technology wholeheartedly, using special effects to show us the history of the Louvre and giving us amazing drone-captured visuals of Paris from low altitudes.
  Positive
He blends archival footage with dramatic re-creations mocked up to look like newsreel material, and he even has Napoleon Bonaparte Vincent Nemeth strut the halls of the Louvre, exclaiming Cest moi!
  Very negative
when he sees a painting of himself.
  Neutral
Marianne Johanna Korthas Altes, the national symbol of the French Republic, joins Napoleon in the Louvre, and yes, this is a documentary, but it contains more flights of fancy and more imagined scenarios than most works of fiction.
  Very negative
At times Sokurov goes so deep with the digressions and the stylized visuals it becomes a bit of a chore to follow along  but even when Francofonia is at its most self-congratulatory and feels a bit condescending, its something to see.
  Positive
As Sokurov examines a pivotal point in the Louvres history and gives us a virtual tour of the magnificent museum, he makes larger points about the vital importance of art throughout human history.
  Positive
This is one of the most beautiful films of the year.
  Very positive
