One of the many surprising delights in the bright and brassy and wonderfully funny Thor: Ragnarok is the recasting of the God of Thunder as a perpetual underdog.
  Positive
Of course the Hulk Mark Ruffalo, who becomes Thors buddy-movie sidekick this time around, dwarfs the muscle-laden pride of Asgard Chris Hemsworth, terrific and self-deprecating.
  Negative
Thor looks even tinier compared to Surturs menacing dragon creature.
  Negative
That beast could swallow our guy whole and not even burp.
  Neutral
Nor is Thor remotely close to being the best warrior in this movie.
  Negative
Hes at best an even match against the Hulk' he butts heads with a former Valkryie Tessa Thompson who is at least his equal in hand-to-god combat, and he doesnt stand a chance in a one-on-one faceoff with his older sister, the evil and all-powerful Hela, aka the Goddess of Death Cate Blanchett.
  Very negative
Nice nickname, Hela.
  Positive
Oh, and Thor is also at the mercy of Jeff Goldblums Grandmaster, the ruthless and immortal and absolutely stark raving mad ruler of Sakaar, where the hedonism is fueled by slave labor.
  Negative
Grandmaster is practically immortal.
  Positive
Hes like  billion years old.
  Neutral
He treats Thor like a puppy dog.
  Negative
Theres a LOT going on in director Taiki Waititis Thor: Ragnarok, and much of it is goofy and campy and marvelously self-referential.
  Negative
To be sure, Ragnarok has the big-budget, mega-battle, intergalactic heft of a Marvel superhero movie  but the casual, loose personality of the film is very Guardians of the Galaxy.
  Negative
Surely no accident.
  Negative
After a number of small teases in previous films, the Guardians and Avengers will have their big crossover moment in s Avengers: Infinity War.
  Negative
Ragnarok begins with Thor saying goodbye to his father Odin Anthony Hopkins shortly after reuniting with brother Loki Tom Hiddleston, who isnt dead after all because Tom Hiddleston is far too fantastic playing Loki for the Marvel movie universe to really and truly kill off Loki.
  Negative
Loki and Thor have gone through more estrangements and reconciliations and betrayals and rinses and repeats than sibling characters on a s daytime soap opera.
  Negative
Thor even points out the act is getting old, and hes got to stop falling for Lokis sincerity act only to get the rug pulled out from under him once again.
  Negative
For a while the boys DO team up  against their sister Hela, a vicious and casually murderous goddess who costumes it up like vintage Vegas Cher and speaks in grand tones, as if Will Shakespeare has written her lines.
  Negative
As the boys soon learn, Hela is infinitely more powerful than the two of them combined.
  Positive
So while Hela returns to Asgard and begins to systematically slaughter any rebellious soldiers or civilians, Thor and Loki set out on a quest to 
Well.
  Negative
Each has his own goals, and sometimes those goals put the brothers at odds again.
  Positive
Cate Blanchett is as great as youd expect her to be playing Hela, who is actually kind of sad and tragic.
  Positive
Yes, theres the whole Goddess of Death thing and thats not nice, but Helas brothers didnt even know of her existence until recently and that really irks her, and she doesnt have any real friends save for the giant zombie warrior dudes she recently resurrected from the grave, and even if she assumes her rightful place on the throne in Asgard, wheres the fun in that if everyone is dead or in chains?
  Negative
At least Grandmaster loves his work.
  Positive
And nobody does a better Jeff Goldblum impersonation than Jeff Goldblum.
  Negative
Hes flat-out hilarious as the crazed but always upbeat dictator.
  Positive
ScreenwritersCraig Kyle, Christopher Yost and Eric Pearson and director Waititi also came up with a clever way to make the Hulk more interesting.
  Positive
For two years running, we learn, its been all Hulk, no Bruce Banner  but a slight trace of Banners wit and personality has managed to work its way into the Hulks DNA.
  Negative
Hulk now funny.
  Positive
Tessa Thompson makes for a badass fallen Valkryie, Idris Elba is perfectly cast as the selfless and fearless Heimdall and Karl Urban has a couple of shining moments as Skurge, whose survival instincts clash with the instincts of his better self.
  Neutral
What an outstanding cast.
  Very positive
They all came to play.
  Neutral
The only thing I enjoyed more than the comedy in Thor: Ragnarok was a climactic battle sequence synced perfectly to Led Zeppelins Immigrant Song.
  Positive
The hammer of the gods
Well drive our ships to new lands
To fight the horde, and sing and cry
Valhalla, I am coming!
  Negative
Damn straight.
  Neutral
