Over the last  years and some , screenings, I have tried to hold sacred perhaps THE cardinal rule of the moviegoing experience, and that of course is:
NO TALKING.
  Negative
Maybe once every five or six screenings Ill make a quiet observation to a fellow critic seated next to me, or Ill ask a question of a colleague.
  Neutral
But even on those occasions, I keep it quick and quiet.
  Positive
Mothers Day broke me down.
  Neutral
I couldn't help myself.
  Negative
On at least a half-dozen occasions, I was so dumbfounded by what was transpiring onscreen I blurted out an immediate reaction  and at least twice, I smacked the guy next to me on the shoulder.
  Negative
Sorry, Bill Stamets!
  Positive
A paraphrased recap of some of the comments I muttered under my breath or at least I hope it was under my breath and not a full-out cry for help:
 Im pretty sure not a single character in this Atlanta-set movie speaks with a Southern accent.
  Negative
Tax break, anyone?
  Neutral
Did that old guy Texas redneck who wears patriotic clothing and has a chicken wing literally hanging out of his mouth when he drives his oversized motor home really call his daughters Indian husband a towel-head shortly after meeting him?
  Negative
For laughs?
  Neutral
And when the rednecks wife sees a lesbian from behind, she calls her a he?
  Neutral
What year is this?
  Neutral
Gee, I really hope COORS LIGHT, THE FOUR SEASONS, FIJI BOTTLED WATER, CADILLAC, Mamp'Ms, SKITTLES et al. are happy with the blatant product placement shots in this movie.
  Negative
The owner of a bar called Shortys is a little person?
  Neutral
Really?
  Neutral
Youre giving us the old character delivers a monologue with her back turned, not realizing her intended audience has exited the room bit?
  Negative
Come on!
  Positive
By all means, after an adult Caucasian is injured while performing a karaoke version of The Humpty Dance, cut to the sassy black woman saying, Thats what happens when white people try to rap, and top it off with a shot of a black child dancing with impeccable rhythm.
  Positive
This movie never should have seen the light of day or the dark of theater.
  Negative
Mothers Day is Garry Marshalls third star-studded, mawkish, bloated, holiday-themed film with intertwining characters and story lines.
  Negative
First there was the mediocre Valentines Day .
  Neutral
Then we were subjected to the sappy but relatively harmless New Years Eve .
  Neutral
But nothing could have prepared us for the offensively stupid, shamelessly manipulative, ridiculously predictable and hopelessly dated crapfest that is Mothers Day.
  Negative
Nearly everyone in the talented and likable cast, including a number of Garry Marshall regulars, is to be commended for trying to lend some air of authenticity to the broadly sketched characters  even if nobody succeeds.
  Neutral
Jennifer Aniston plays Sandy, a divorced mom of two boys who has hopes of getting back together with her rakishly handsome ex Henry Timothy Olyphant  until Henry tells Sandy he recently got married to the twentysomething bombshell Tina Shay Mitchell.
  Negative
Kate Hudsons Jesse is married to a doctor named Russell Aasif Mandvi, and they have a toddler son, but she hasnt told her parents Earl and Flo Robert Pine and Margo Martindale because theyre horrible racists who wouldnt approve.
  Negative
Oh, and shes been lying to Russell all this time, telling him her parents are in ill health and living in a retirement facility.
  Negative
Sarah Chalke plays Jesses lesbian sister, who hasnt told her parents you remember the lovable Earl and Flo about HER marriage because theyre just as homophobic as they are racist.
  Negative
Hilarious!
  Positive
Jason Sudeikis is a widower and father of two daughters who is still clinging to the memory of his wife, a military hero played by Jennifer Garner in the obligatory sad late-night video sequence.
  Negative
And you better believe we get an over-the-top remembering-mom scene complete with an orchestral version of Taps.
  Negative
Julia Roberts plays Miranda, a career-driven TV hostess who peddles hideous jewelry and a self-help book.
  Negative
Britt Robertson is Kristin, a young mother who cant fully commit to the father, an aspiring stand-up comedian.
  Negative
As Kristin explains to Jesse, she was adopted and she has always wondered about her birth mother.
  Negative
I have abandonment issues, says Kristin.
  Negative
Thanks Kristin.
  Positive
We got that when you told us about being adopted and never hearing from your birth mother.
  Neutral
From just about everything weve read and heard about Garry Marshall over the years, hes a kind and nurturing fellow who always finds roles in his films for regulars such as Hector Elizondo, Larry Miller and Sandra Taylor.
  Negative
He also often finds room for himself, his family members  and relatives of cast members.
  Positive
Thats nice.
  Positive
Marshall apparently also gets a kick out of Julia Roberts referencing Pretty Woman.
  Negative
In a closing credits scene in Valentines Day, a limo driver points out Rodeo Drive to Roberts character, and asks if she ever shopped there.
  Negative
I did once, she replies.
  Positive
It was a big mistake.
  Negative
Big.
  Neutral
Huge.
  Neutral
This of course is a play on one of Vivians most famous lines in Pretty Woman, when she gains her revenge on the snooty Rodeo Drive shop assistant who had turned away her business the day before.
  Negative
In Pretty Woman, Elizondo played a hotel executive who takes a fatherly liking to Miss Vivian and teaches her about the proper use of silverware.
  Positive
I definitely have the salad fork, says Vivian.
  Neutral
The rest of the silverware is a little confusing.
  Negative
In Mothers Day, Roberts Miranda is having lunch when her manager Lance, played by Elizondo, interrupts to dispense some pearls of wisdom.
  Negative
Apropos of nothing, Lance tells Miranda, You definitely have the salad fork.
  Negative
People, it's literally the same wig worn by Roberts in 'Helix,' the movie within a movie in 'Notting Hill.'
  Neutral
From Hitchcock to Spielberg to those rascals at Pixar, filmmakers have often dropped inside references to their own previous films, or movies they loved.
  Positive
Usually theres at least a touch of subtlety.
  Neutral
Like just about everything else in Mothers Day, the nod to the earlier movies are clumsy and pointless and obvious.
  Negative
