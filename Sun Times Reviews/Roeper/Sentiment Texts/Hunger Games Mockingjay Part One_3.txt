Lost it as in losing loved ones, and lost it as in, out of their minds.

Katniss beloved Peeta Mellark Josh Hutcherson, having been left behind when all hell broke loose, is now apparently the only guest on the Capitols official TV network, where Stanley Tuccis insanely upbeat Caesar Flickerman prods Peeta to urge the rebels to lay down their weapons.

Mockingjay  Part  is a dark film on two levels: in tone and in the visuals onscreen.
  Positive
Though were once again treated to often stunning production design and first-rate CGI, most of the film takes place at night or in underground bunkers.
  Positive
On the rare occasions when the action takes place above ground and in the light of day, most of what we see are the human remains and the rubble in districts largely wiped out by President Snows forces.
  Positive
Lawrence owns the role of Katniss from the moment she appears onscreen  but shes once again playing the reluctant heroine, telling everyone from District  President Alma Coin Julianne Moore, looking a bit like Madonna with her straightened, white-blonde hair to the still-smitten Gale Hawthorne Liam Hemsworth to propaganda guru Plutarch Heavensbee the late Philip Seymour Hoffman she never wanted to be the symbol of the revolution.

For a long stretch  too long  Mockingjay Part  plays like a futuristic version of Wag the Dog, with Plutarch overseeing the work of a film crew led by Natalie Dormers Cressida.
  Very negative
Their mission is to create a series of propaganda short films, or propos, they hope to transmit to the other districts.

And theres Woody Harrelson, more than a quarter-century after playing Old Shoe in the propaganda film in Wag the Dog, now playing the guy who figures out you cant get Katniss to manufacture her fire' youve got to take her to her bombed-out home district and to a hospital housing the wounded so she can realize how many have sacrificed everything for the cause.

Only then will the pro-revolution commercials ring true!

The Hunger Games  and The Hunger Games: Catching Fire  were superb adaptations of the wildly popular books by Suzanne Collins, with spot-on casting, beautiful sets and production design, and first-rate special effects that did a surprisingly good job of capturing some of the more fantastical elements of Collins imagination.
  Positive
Were back in business for chapter three of the film series, with the Austrian director Francis Lawrence returning from his Catching Fire triumph to deliver another rousing yet often bleak and downbeat film that focuses a lot more on tragedies and setbacks than applause-generating heroics.
  Negative
Often Mockingjay teeters on the shore of maudlin waters, and sometimes it gets wet.
  Negative
When Katniss sings a dirge titled The Hanging Tree, there was a moment when I got the chills  and then it just kept going, and going, and going, way past the point of overkill.

After one major character literally and quite clearly warns the rebels, another major character proclaims, Hes sending a warning!

Indeed.

If The Hunger Games: Mockingjay  Part  coming to theaters in November  has a running time equal to Part , that means the last entry in the trilogy will total over four hours.
  Negative
As was the case with the Twilight franchise, the reasons for the split of the adaptation of the last book seem more financial than creative.
  Negative
Even with so many colorful characters returning  and so many of them dealing with huge changes in their respective worlds  things become repetitive.
  Negative
Too many semi-rousing speeches from President Coin, too many scenes of Katniss reacting to the horrors of war, too many scenes weve seen in other films especially the animal-themed segments.
  Very negative
A genuinely shocking moment involving Peeta.
  Positive
Ultimately, The Hunger Games: Part   Mockingjay serves as solid if unspectacular first lap around the track of a two-lap race.
  Positive
Were heading for home, and we know the best is yet to come.
