If only Deadpool were as clever, dark and funny as it believes itself to be.
  Neutral
Self-satisfied to the point of irritation, Deadpool is the latest in an apparently endless supply of superhero films  and like just about every other new superhero movie, its clearly designed as the launching point for a future franchise.
  Negative
See Daredevil, Catwoman, The Green Hornet and not one but two Fantastic Four efforts.
  Positive
Actually, I like you, so please DONT see any of those movies.
  Positive
Directed with no small amount of flash and style by Tim Miller, Deadpool stars Ryan Reynolds in a bit of casting thats almost too easy, seeing as how the character of Deadpool is a real wisenheimer, and Reynolds has long specialized in playing fast-talking quipsters.
  Negative
The comically violent opening action sequence and the credits serve notice were in for a superhero movie that will be as much about spoofing the genre and winking at the audience as it will be about serving up a genuine storyline.
  Negative
In fact, the credits are kind of great, as were told the movie will feature A British Villain and a CGI Character, was produced by some Real A'hats and was written by The Real Heroes.
  Negative
We also get references to Reynolds ill-fated turn as Green Lantern, his heavily criticized appearance as Deadpool in X-Men Origins: Wolverine and his  Sexiest Man Alive People magazine cover.
  Negative
Clad in a pseudo-sadomasochistic, red-and-black leather costume, wearing a mask vaguely reminiscent of the getup sported by The Gimp in Pulp Fiction, Deadpool is an unstoppable killing machine who takes great pleasure in mowing down bad guys while keeping up a stream-of-consciousness monologue filled with one-liners, mostly lazy pop culture references, random thoughts Did I leave the stove on?
  Very negative
and more than a few homoerotic observations.
  Neutral
Deadpools romantic interest is a woman, but the way he talks about Wolverines, um, equipment, and the conversations he has with men, make us wonder if hes interesting in expanding his horizons.
  Positive
Deadpool hits the ground running with a gory shootout on a highway and those cool credits  but soon after that were plunged into a prolonged flashback in which we learn, you guessed it, THE ORIGINS OF DEADPOOL.
  Negative
Again with the origin story?
  Neutral
Whether its Spider-Man or Ant-Man, The Hulk or Captain America, Wolverine or The Fantastic Four, rare is the origin movie with an origin actually worth a giant chunk of a movie.
  Positive
Batman Begins and Iron Man being two exceptions.
  Neutral
In Deadpool, with the anti-hero himself narrating the journey, even telling us when he breaks the fourth wall and breaks the fourth wall of the fourth wall, making  walls, as Deadpool points out, we learn Deadpool was originally a former Special Ops badass turned mercenary named Wade T. Wilson.
  Negative
Wades more than a bit of a jerk, and he takes sadistic pleasure in inflicting pain on his victims  but his targets are irredeemable criminals, so we sorta like the guy.
  Negative
T.J. Miller has some winning moments as Wades best friend, a bartender who loves to give hima hard time.
  Positive
Morena Baccarin is the alluring Vanessa, who may or may not be a prostitute, goes quip-to-quip with Wade and is clearly designed to be a takeoff on the obligatory superhero girlfriend  but the role is really just the obligatory superhero girlfriend part.
  Negative
Just because a film acknowledges that doesnt make it less so.
  Negative
Wade falls in love with Vanessa, and he keeps marveling at how shes so perfect its like a computer made her.
  Positive
Vanessa has an insatiable sex drive, at one point taking charge in a way I really cant describe here.
  Negative
Its a perfect life!
  Positive
Until Wade learns he has terminal cancer.
  Negative
Next thing we know, Wade has volunteered for an experimental and radical treatment  and we all know how well that sort of thing goes in superhero movies.
  Negative
Ed Skrein is the aforementioned British villain, a torture specialist named Ajax who claims he feels no physical pain and no emotions whatsoever, though Wade certainly gets under his skin.
  Negative
In scene after scene after scene, Ajax inflicts unspeakable pain on Wade, who keeps the jokes coming even when hes on the verge of dying.
  Negative
It takes far too long for Wade to emerge from the torture chamber as Deadpool, who now has superpowers, including the ability to heal from just about any wound  but is also hideously disfigured and even more manic than ever.
  Negative
Deadpools back story could have been told in about five minutes screen time.
  Negative
Flash forward to present day, and Deadpools obsession with tracking down Ajax and making him pay.
  Positive
Along the way, he strikes up an uneasy alliance with mutants Angel Dust Gina Carano and Colossus voiced by Stefan Kapicic, a Russian giant able to take on a metallic form.
  Negative
Director Miller proudly flaunts the R rating with some creatively horrific action sequences, and Reynolds keeps up the banter till the very end.
  Negative
Problem is, Deadpool, like so many other satires, ends up being not all that different from the films its spoofing.
  Negative
Also, weve seen wisecracking anti-heroes time and again, from The Mask to Iron-Man.
  Negative
And its not really all that original to tell the story of a reluctant superhero who keeps telling everyone hes not a superhero.
  Negative
If Deadpool does well at the box office, no doubt well see more chapters in the saga.
  Positive
I wouldnt be surprised if I liked the sequel more than the original.
  Positive
For one thing, we wont get bogged down in an origin story.
  Negative
