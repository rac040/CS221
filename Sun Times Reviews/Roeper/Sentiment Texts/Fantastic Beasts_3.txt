What a wonderful wizard world.
  Very positive
Some  years after the release of the first Harry Potter movie, the J.K. Rowling cinematic universe expands to the past and to the spin-off world with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, the first of a reported five films in a franchise that kicks off in the New York of the s  decades before Harry, Hermione and Ron first cracked open textbooks at Hogwarts across the pond.
  Negative
Theres a whole lot of movie going on here  and more than enough groundwork to carry a fresh franchise sure to be populated with wizards of varying moral stripe, No-Majs the American version of Muggles, a k a non-wizards and of course fantastic beasts ranging from the tiny and whimsical to the enormous and ferocious to the dark and dangerous.
  Positive
Beasts is based, sort of, on the textbook authored by Rowling in the guise of Newt Scamander, a magizoologist who traveled the globes studying and preserving dozens of magical animals.
  Negative
Albus Dumbledore wrote the foreword, and the textbook contained notes purportedly written by Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley.
  Negative
Now its a movie  although its more an origins story about Scamanders early adventures than an attempt to adapt the textbook, which wouldnt have made for much of a movie seeing as how its mostly a textbook.
  Negative
Do you need to know all this to enjoy Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them?
  Neutral
Must you be well versed in all things Potter to appreciate the many layers of storytelling and the nods to future developments and characters?
  Positive
It will help quite a bit.
  Positive
Beasts does work as a stand-alone movie, but while its solid and entertaining and often quite amusing, it doesnt pack the wallop of the first Harry Potter movie.
  Positive
Theres a lot of neat stuff going on, but even with all the literal groundbreaking of New York City streets, its not a groundbreaking piece of fantasy.
  Negative
Eddie Redmayne, bursting with tousled hair and aw-shucks grins and absent-minded professor charm, is Newt Scamander, who arrives in the New York of the mid-s toting a battered, slightly damaged suitcase containing a number of magical creatures, including a mischievous, duck-billed Niffler' the praying mantis-like, clingy and cute little Bowtruckle' the creepy, monkey-like, sometimes invisible Demiguise' the snake-like Occamy, and there just might be a dragon or two in that suitcase as well.
  Very negative
Its a wonder Newt had room to pack a change of underwear and a fresh shirt for the big trip.
  Positive
Anyway.
  Neutral
One of the creatures gets loose, and then another, and then another  and off we go on a wild, sometimes convoluted, multi-pronged adventure, with some No-Majs engaging in an actual witch-hunt to prove wizards exist, and the wizard community itself torn by controversy, what with the evil Gellert Grindelwald missing in action, and Percival Graves Colin Farrell, the Director of Magical Security for the Magical Congress of the United States of America MACUSA, up to some double-crossing and triple-crossing schemes.
  Very negative
Dan Fogler provides ample comic relief as Jacob Kowalski, a No-Maj factory worker with dreams of running a bakery.
  Positive
He finds himself neck deep in the wizard world quite by accident.
  Negative
Fogler lends charm and heart to what could have been the obligatory I cant believe what Im seeing!
  Positive
role.
  Neutral
Katherine Waterston doesnt create much spark in the role of Porpentina Goldstein, a low-level witch with MACUSA trying to work her way back up the investigative ladder.
  Negative
Alison Sudol is more fun as Queenie Goldstein, Porpentinas bubbly, mind-reading younger sister, who takes a shine to Jacob Kowalski.
  Negative
And then theres a somber Samantha Morton as Mary Lou Barebone, the abusive leader of the New Salem Philanthropic Society in other words, witch hunters, and Ezra Miller as Credence Barebone, Mary Lous freaky and creepy adopted son, who looks for all the world like a DC Comics supervillain in the making.
  Negative
The dark material involving the Barebones is a world away from the slapstick comedy involving Jacob and the benign magical creatures.
  Positive
Some of the wacky, slow-motion antics with the CGI animals seem straight out of a not particularly inspired Super Bowl commercial.
  Negative
Fantastic Beasts is directed by the stellar veteran David Yates, who helmed the last four Potter films and is clearly at home in this expanded universe.
  Positive
The special effects are of course top level though again, I wouldnt say theyre breathtakingly special' the sets are amazingly rich in detail' the cinematography is fluid and vibrant.
  Positive
The result is an effective if not everlasting magical spell.
  Negative
