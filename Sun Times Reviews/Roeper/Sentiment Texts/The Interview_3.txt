So stupid.
  Very negative
For any hackercyber-terrorist to be so intimidated and threatened by something as ridiculously over-the-top and cartoonishly goofy as The Interview is just plain stupid.
  Negative
And speaks volumes about their insecurity.
  Positive
For the biggest theater chains in North America to back away from the showing the film: stupid.
  Negative
For Sony Pictures to announce itwouldnt be showing the film ANYWHERE was beyond stupid.
  Negative
Even Sonys decision to reverse itself was kind of sketchy: a relatively minor rollout in a few hundred theaters across the country, coinciding with an online release six bucks to rent,  to own  on Christmas Eve, when folks are a little preoccupied.
  Negative
Rarely have so many intelligent people made so many bad decisions about such a stupid movie.
  Negative
Turns out The Interview is basically Harold and Kumar Go to North Korea, with an endless parade of scatological humor and homosexual double-entendre jokes, a smattering of political commentary, and have I mentioned its just really stupid and at times laugh-out-loud funny?
  Very negative
Co-directors Even Goldberg and Seth Rogen who also wrote the screenplay, along with Dan Sterling announce their intentions for the comedy to be silly and broad from the start, with a musical number featuring a sweet little North Korean girl singing an anthem about hating Americans.
  Negative
with lyrics such as:
May they be helpless, poor and sad and cold!
  Negative
They are arrogant and fat!
  Negative
They are stupid and they are evil.
  Negative
Die America die!
  Neutral
And off we go.
  Neutral
James Franco, in a performance that skirts the border of obnoxiousness and sometimes crosses over, hams it up big-time as Dave Skylark, a narcissistic empty suit who hosts a successful info-tainment program.
  Negative
Rogen is Daves producer and best friend, Aaron, who yearns to do more serious journalism but also gets really pumped when Dave scores a big coup, e.g., Eminem saying, Ive been pretty much leaving a breadcrumb trail of gayness with his lyrics.
  Positive
Eminem just said he was gay FOUR TIMES on our show!
  Negative
bellows Aaron.
  Neutral
Eminems coming-out party is the first of maybe a dozen gay-themed moments in The Interview.
  Negative
Dave and Aaron act more like a bickering couple than best buds, with Dave constantly pleading with Aaron not to leave him' Dave reaching out and caressing Aaron at every opportunity'and Dave even kissing Aaron on the mouth.
  Negative
Not that theyre gay.
  Neutral
Both have multiple heterosexual liaisons along the way.
  Neutral
Chances are you know the main plot.
  Neutral
Dave and Aaron score an exclusive interview with Kim Jong Un, whos a big fan of their show.
  Positive
Thats not much of a stretch from real life, considering Kim Jong Uns bizarre friendship with basketballerdupe Dennis Rodman.
  Negative
The CIA, led by the comely Agent Lacey Lizzy Caplan, recruits Dave and Aaron to take out the despicable Kim.
  Positive
It takes about six attempts for her to get them to understand the CIA doesnt want them to take the Supreme Leader of the Democratic Peoples Republic of North Korea to dinner  they want the boys to assassinate the guy.
  Negative
Were nearly halfway through the film  and things were starting to drag a bit  before we meet Kim Jong Un, and Randall Park provides instant energy and some major chuckles with a terrific comedic performance.
  Positive
No doubt its no more authentic a representation of Kim Jong Un than Will Ferrells George W. Bush or Jay Pharoahs Barack Obama or Chevy Chases Gerald Ford, but thats kind of the point with satire, right?
  Neutral
The difference is we can make fun of our leaders without fear of being stuck in a concentration camp.
  Positive
Parks Kim Jong Un is a starstruck buffoon who swoons in Daves presence and eagerly tries to win his approval by taking Dave for a ride in his tank, playing hoops with Dave and providing Dave with booze and topless companions.
  Negative
Kims also clearly nuts, as he cheerfully acknowledges to Dave.
  Negative
Oh, and hes a softy who loves puppies and asks Dave if its gay to like Katy Perry and margaritas.
  Positive
If liking Katy Perry and margaritas is gay, then who wants to be straight?
  Neutral
says Dave.
  Neutral
Not me!
  Neutral
comes the reply.
  Neutral
The Interview sticks to the anything-for-a-laugh plan for nearly the entire journey, with far too many jokes about things going in and coming out of rear ends' goofy sex scenes involving Aaron and Kims beautiful minister of propaganda a game Diana Bang' and some Tarantino-esque explosions of violence, with fingers being bitten off and heads being blown off in comically grotesque fashion.
  Very negative
Its real hit-and-miss stuff in more ways than one.
  Positive
Some hard truths about life in North Korea  the , citizens in concentration camps, the millions of people going hungry, the propaganda machine that tries to turn Kim into some sort of God  are detailed, so yeah, this film isnt playing in North Korea.
  Negative
But The Interview is much more an R-rated, st-century version of an old HopeCrosby road movie than a modern-day Dr. Strangelove.
  Negative
Its mostly stupid is what it is.
  Negative
And someday  like in February   were all going to look back on this madness and wonder what all the fuss was about.
  Negative
