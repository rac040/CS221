You could write brief descriptions of any  relatively significant chapters in American history, toss 'em all into one of those hand-cranked raffle cylinders, pluck out one entry '
And Ill bet Steven Spielberg could turn that event into an Oscar-bait motion picture experience.
  Negative
To wit: Bridge of Spies.
  Neutral
Some  years into his career and still a master of his craft a few camera moves and special effects moments in this film are simply dazzling, Spielberg has taken an important but largely forgotten and hardly action-packed slice of the Cold War and turned it into a gripping character study and thriller that feels a bit like a John Le Carre adaptation if Frank Capra were at the controls.
  Very positive
Bridge of Spies is set mostly in the mid- and late s, when the Cold War between the Americans and the Soviets was heating up  and the East Germans, filled with resentment toward the United States and loathing for the Russians, were hell-bent on finding their own place at the Superpower Table.
  Negative
On some days a global nuclear war seemed more likely than not.
  Negative
We open on the Brooklyn of , where a seemingly meek man of late middle age quietly goes about his daily routine, which involves painting portraits and, oh yes, working as a mole for the Soviets.
  Negative
In a tightly choreographed and perfectly paced sequence set in the subway system, the man eludes a battery of serious FBI men in serious dark coats and hats  but only temporarily, as it turns out.
  Positive
Eventually they show up at his door, put him in cuffs and turn the place upside down in search of evidence.
  Negative
The man is one Rudolf Abel played by the British theater actor Mark Rylance in a performance of great subtlety, dignity and droll humor.
  Very positive
Theres little doubt Abels a Soviet spy, but he will be given a trial, so America can show the world everyone in the United States is entitled to a defense, even an illegal immigrant working to help bring the country to its knees.
  Negative
Enter Tom Hanks, in full modern-day Jimmy Stewart mode, as James Donovan, a genial family man and successful insurance attorney whos almost always the smartest man in the room and doesnt mind if others in his presence perceive otherwise.
  Neutral
Donovan seems an unlikely choice to defend Abel  but he was a prosecutor at Nuremberg, hes a well-respected legal presence, and hell mount a capable defense, even though it will make him one of the most despised men in America and of course theres zero chance of actually winning the case.
  Very negative
The United States government and the great majority of Americans want Abel put to death  but Donovan argues passionately and successfully for an extended prison sentence, arguing Abel could be of great value in case an American soldierspy is caught by the Soviets and theres a chance of a prisoner swap.
  Positive
Which is exactly what happens.
  Neutral
In a heart-thumping sequence that reminds us Spielberg is one of the godfathers of cool action sequences with cutting-edge effects, American U- pilot Francis Gary Powers an excellent Austin Stowell is blasted out of the skies by a Soviet fighter, ejecting just in time to see his plane explode as he parachutes to safety  and captivity.
  Positive
Now the U.S. government has another assignment for civilian attorney James Donovan.
  Neutral
Theyd like him to go to Berlin, which has recently been split by a concrete wall, and negotiate a trade.
  Negative
We shift from the rain-soaked film noir streets of New York to bleak, snow-blanketed Berlin, where Donovan goes deep into the rabbit hole in a series of increasingly convoluted and sometimes comically bizarre adventures as he attempts to secure a trade of Abel for Powers  along with an American student recently detained by the Germans.
  Negative
The Coen brothers did an extensive polish on the screenplay, and their handiwork seems most evident in the Berlin scenes.
  Negative
Nursing drinks while stating his case with various Soviet and German officials who arent even honest about their actual titles, fighting off a cold, Donovan keeps telling everyone he just wants to get this thing done so he can go home and crawl into his own bed.
  Negative
Such fine and measured work from Hanks, who is as good as anyone has ever been at playing men of great integrity and warm hearts who arent to be trifled with when the heat is on.
  Positive
Dont mistake the smile and the friendly handshake for weakness.
  Negative
Spielberg and his superb cinematographer Janusz Kaminski deliver some excellent visual callbacks, as when Donovan looks out the window of a train and sees Brooklyn kids climbing fences separating their backyards  and is reminded of the barbed wire-crowned Berlin Wall.
  Positive
The supporting cast, including Amy Ryan as Donovans wife and Scott Shepherdas a CIA operative who becomes Donovans unofficial partner in espionage, is first-rate.
  Positive
Hanks will be in the conversation for best actor, Rylance will almost certainly be nominated for best supporting actor, and when the titles of the five-plus films nominated for best picture are announced, it will be a surprise if Bridge of Spies doesnt make the cut.
  Positive
