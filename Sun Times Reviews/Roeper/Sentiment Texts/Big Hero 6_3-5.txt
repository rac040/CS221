Itll never happen because nobody will ever be able to get the rights from Disney, but Id like to see a movie showing how all those animated Disney parents died or took off, leaving everyone from Cinderella to Esmerelda to Jasmine to Ariel to Nemo to Andy from Toy Story with either just one parent or not a mom or dad in sight.
  Negative
Of course, some Disney tragedies take place during the movie.

The death of Bambis mother is brutal.

San Francisco and Tokyo  and its one of the most beautiful and vibrant animated worlds in recent memory.
  Very positive
The same could be said of the movie itself.
  Neutral
Loosely based on one of the lesser known Marvel comics, Big Hero  is a big, gorgeous, consistently funny and touching animated adventure with wonderful voice performances, some dark undertones that give the story more depth, more than a few laugh-out-loud moments, an uplifting message and an origin story that openly acknowledges yes, this is another origin story so lets just have fun with it.
  Very positive
Co-directed by Don Hall and Chris Williams, Big Hero is a fusion of traditional Disney animation, -D thats about as good as -D gets which means its still not really necessary and just a touch of Japanese anime as seen in the films of such masters as Hayao Miyazaki.
  Negative
Young Ryan Potter is terrific voicing Hiro, who graduated from high school at  and is now spending his nights entering his lethal little microbot in underground street battles.

Its like cockfighting for uber-nerds.

But after Hiro visits Tadashis science lab at the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology and sees the amazing projects Tadashi and his pals are building, hes obsessed with coming to the university to work with the gang and learn from the legendary Professor Robert Callaghan the great James Cromwell.

Theres a little bit of a Saturday morning cartoon feel and I mean that in a good way to the multi-ethnic and thoroughly likable team of genius students, including Wasabi Damon Wayans Jr., a laser specialist whos built like Captain America but has numerous phobias and is a borderline OCD neat freak' Honey Lemon Genesis Rodriguez, a chemistry prodigy with a sweet personality' Go Go Tamago Jamie Chung, an engineering student with a street-punk persona, and Fred T.J. Miller, a slacker and comic book geek who doesnt even attend the university  he just likes hanging around with these brilliant minds and suggesting inventions like the invisible sandwich.

Each character gets a moment or two to shine, but Hiro winds up becoming best friends with Baymax, a health care robot designed by his big brother.
  Negative
From the moment the portly, Stay Puft Marshmallow Man-looking Baymax voiced by Scott Adsit inflates to life, blinking his eyes and speaking in a soothing voice and offering hugs as part of his health care treatment, you can imagine the millions upon millions of Baymax toys that will be flying off the shelves and dropped into Amazon.com carts this holiday season.

After a terrible tragedy complete with a scene of post-funeral, black-clad mourners gathering at a home, which has to be a first for an animated childrens movie, Hiro and the gang must go up against a masked supervillain whos out to destroy them.
  Very negative
Thats when Big Hero  kicks into action movie gear, with each member of the team utilizing his or her skill set to morph into a budding superhero, and Hiro turning Baymax into a flying, fighting machine.
  Positive
Though as Baymax keeps pointing out, hes been programmed as a caregiver, and as such he cannot hurt another human being.
  Negative
The HiroBaymax dynamic is the heart of Big Hero , as Hiro tries to turn Baymax into something hes not, and Baymax, though supposedly incapable of feeling emotion, becomes Hiros best friend and his spiritual guide.
  Positive
As Jessica Klang of the Playlist pointed out after she saw Big Hero  at the Tokyo Film Festival, the relationship between Hiro and Baymax is not unlike John Connors friendship with the Terminator in Judgment Day.
  Negative
Some of the themes are too intense for the youngest of children, but for school-age kids and for the parents and guardians who will be taking the children, Big Hero  is a terrific adventure, a heartwarming tale of friendship and, yes, it sets the table quite nicely for more chapters to come.
  Positive
Hiro and his friends are the stuff of franchises.
