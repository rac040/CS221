For the first couple of minutes of Susan Sarandons performance as a Noo Joisey widow who TAWKS LIKE DIS in The Meddler, I was fidgeting in my seat, wondering if Id be calling this one of the truly awful performances in Ms. Sarandons wonderful career.
  Negative
Ah but then, in the same way Sarandons needy, busybody chatterbox Marnie turns out to be something much more complex and endearing and lovely and surprising, the performance itself took root and grew on me to the point where I didnt want to say goodbye to Marnie.
  Negative
The Meddler is a prime example of a Mom Movie, and as Ive explained before, thats not a jab or even a backhanded compliment, its sincere as the hug youre going to give your ma on Mothers Day.
  Negative
Its the kind of the movie you can take your mom to see, whether your mom is  or , and it has enough crossover appeal to entertain certain and by certain I mean male moviegoers who are already rolling their eyes and thinking of excuses to avoid seeing a film about a feisty widow from New Jersey.
  Positive
Writer-director Lorene Scafaria takes a sitcom of a premise and imbues it with depth, intelligence and numerous sweet, melancholy moments that feel just  right.
  Positive
We know people like the people in this movie, and sometimes they get on our nerves and sometimes they need to get over themselves  and most of the time we cant imagine life without them.
  Negative
Sarandon, looking an authentic and magnificently beautiful  the actress turns that age later this year, plays an incessantly upbeat but lonely widow who moved from Jersey to Los Angeles shortly after her husband'sdeath a few years back.
  Negative
Marnie has an apartment near the Grove, which she considers a magical place, what with the retail shops and the movie theaters and the entertainment and the water fountain and the trolley cars and the Farmers Market.
  Positive
At first when we hear Marnies voice-over extolling all the exciting aspects of her life in L.A., we think shes providing narration  but it turns out Marnie is leaving long, long, LONG messages with her daughter Lori Rose Byrne, a TV writer whos in a serious funk after a breakup with her hunky actor boyfriend Jacob Jason Ritter.
  Negative
Lori is single, living in a town and working in an industry where even a gorgeous -year-old is considered older, and though she clearly adores her mother, shes right at that age and that place in her personal and professional life where shes REALLY regretting giving her mother who has all the time in the world a key to her apartment.
  Positive
As Marnie prattles on and on about what Lori should do with her life and how she should try to win Jacob back, you know its just a matter of time before Lori explodes at her mother and they go their separate ways.
  Negative
At least for a while.
  Neutral
When Lori zips out to New York to work on a pilot based on her own life, Marnie wants to tag along  but Lori says Marnie has to stay behind and watch Loris dogs.
  Negative
Now with even more time on her hands, Marnie meddles her way into the lives of her daughters friends she attends a baby shower as Loris Plus One even though Lori isnt attending and the -year-old at the Apple Genius Bar who helps Marnie out every other day.
  Negative
Marnie is one of those older moms who have embraced the technology to the point where the grown children want to GIVE UP the technology just to avoid mom.
  Negative
Amy Landecker gives a nice spin as Loris therapist, who becomes Marnies therapist after Marnie shows up unannounced to discuss her daughters problems.
  Negative
J.K. Simmons is all baritone teddy bear as a divorced cop with a thing for Marnie, and this movie is not above giving that cop a Harley with an extra helmet, an acoustic guitar and a perfect little ranch where he raises chickens and gives them all names.
  Very negative
Although The Meddler is filmed in sunny California hues with a detour to a more golden-brown New York and features mostly likable characters and a bounty of laughs, Scafarias screenplay occasionally reminds us of Marnies sometimes-desperate attempts to win the affections of near strangers, and Loris infuriating insecurity shes SO much better than the jackass whodumped her, and the fact even the lovable J.K. Simmons character wasnt a good father.
  Negative
Theres not a one-dimensional character in the bunch.
  Neutral
Taken as a whole, Sarandons performance is something to behold.
  Positive
Yes, she plays it up big with the accent and some broad strokes, but she also finds some quiet, low-key notes, as in the scene where she visits Lori on the set of the pilot and realizes the actors playing the parents in the TV show theyre played by Harry Hamlin and Laura San Giacomo are clearly based on Marnie and her late, beloved husband.
  Negative
Its one of my favorite movie moments of .
