Closing your eyes wont work.
  Positive
If you close your eyes during the scariest scenes in IT, who knows what your imagination might conjure up  because thats what IT is all about.
  Negative
To be sure, Pennywise the Clown is among the most bone-chilling and ferocious and frightening characters in modern literature and now modern cinema  but IT, as he is often called, takes on many forms, manifesting itself as your deepest and darkest fears as it literally smells the fear on you, and feeds off of that.
  Negative
The most frightening scenes in IT arent when Pennywise is front and center, doing his twisted dance and baring his multiple rows of teeth and saying, Youll float too, i.e., You will die and become part of my collection of corpses floating in a hellish limbo in the sewers.
  Negative
Although that stuff is pretty damn scary.
  Neutral
What will REALLY put a chill down your spine and raise the hairs on the back of your neck are the moments when an adolescent character is isolated from friends, all alone in the cellar or the bathroom or the alley or a dark office, and something theyve long feared springs to life in a certain fashion, confirming their worst sense of dread and doom.
  Very negative
We see what they see, we feel what they feel and we are terrified because they are terrified.

Some  years ago, Stephen Kings masterful and massive horror work 'IT' was released to widespread acclaim and huge sales, becoming the bestselling book of  in the United States.
  Positive
In , the novel was adapted for a solid, two-part TV mini-series on ABC with Tim Curry as Pennywise.
  Neutral
Still, the hunger for a big-screen version of IT has only grown over the years and decades, and Im bloody pleased to report director Andy Muschiettis R-rated interpretation of the source material is a bold, intense, beautifully paced, wickedly hilarious, seriously scary and gorgeously terrifying period-piece work that instantly takes its place among the most impressively twisted horror movies of our time.
  Very positive
Director Muschietti and screenwriters Chase Palmer, Cary Fukunaga and Gary Dauberman shift the timeline to the late s and make numerous other changes to Kings source material as does virtually every adaption of every novel, ever, but they do a masterful job of capturing the terrifically rotten and twisted essence of the story.
  Positive
We open on a rainy fall day in the sleepy and almost immediately kind of creepy town of Derry, Maine.
  Negative
Bill Denbrough Jaeden Lieberher, a boy of about  with a stutter, is in bed sick, but his little brother Georgie Jackson Robert Scott pesters Bill into constructing a nifty little paper sailboat.
  Negative
Georgie dashes out of the house and places the sailboat in the curbside stream created by the driving rains, and happily splashes after the boat as it swiftly floats from street to street.
  Negative
And then the boat slips down a drain, and Georgie leans down to retrieve his boat, and 
Lets just say before the day is done, weve met Pennywise Bill Skarsgard, and when he invites you to come along with him and says, Youll float too, this is not going to be one of your better days.
  Very negative
One of the many pleasures of IT is how the filmmakers take their time, introducing us to a half-dozen misfit characters in realistic sometimes painfully so settings that allow us to get to know them, to feel true empathy for their situations, and to understand why each would gravitate toward fellow Losers as they call themselves for support and friendship.
  Negative
Sophia Lillis is Beverly Marsh, who has an unearned reputation for being the school slut and comes home each night to a monstrous father.
  Negative

  Positive

  Negative
Finn Wolfhard is the wisecracking Richie.

  Negative
When a film of this magnitude has so many young characters front and center in the lead roles, so much depends on the casting  and in this case, theres not a single misstep.
  Neutral
Each of these young actors has at least one major moment in the spotlight, and each is unique and likable and real.
  Very positive
In fact, the non-horror storylines, the development of the relationships in this film  all of that is so strong, IT would have been a compelling movie on those elements alone.
  Positive
Ah, but were all here for Pennywise and the evil it unleashes on this town.
  Negative
Were all here to root for these kids, many of whom have one or no parents and most of whom would be better off on their own, as they marshal forces and literally drop themselves into Pennywises pit of horror.
  Negative
The adults in this film are either awful or useless.
  Negative
Theyre in a constant state of denial about whats happening in their town.
  Negative
The kids know theyre on their own.
  Neutral
We just go with that.
  Negative
Bill Skarsgards Pennywise shows up only sparingly, and thats a wise choice.
  Positive
To be sure, its a strong performance, and the clown is a worthy successor to all the great scary clowns in movie history  but if Pennywise were to spend too much time on the screen, hed be too tangible, too much of this world.
  Neutral
Hes at his most frightening when hes in the shadows or on the periphery, holding his balloons and licking his chops and saying, Youll float too.
  Neutral
IT comes to a conclusion on just the right series of notes.
  Positive
Chilling, heartbreaking, exciting, sobering.
  Very positive
Were told at the end what we already know: This is but Chapter One of the saga.
  Positive
When we pick up the story, itll be more than a quarter-century later, and these wonderful kids will be adults in their s.
  Positive
In the meantime, we have IT, which carried me along from the opening frame, rarely missing a beat.
  Negative
Youll float too.
  Neutral
