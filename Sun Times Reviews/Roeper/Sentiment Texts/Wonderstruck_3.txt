  Negative
The soundtrack pulsates with 's classics such as David Bowies Space Oddity and Deodatos jazz-funk-synth take on Also Sprach Zarathustra which hasnt been used to such great effect in a film since Peter Sellers Chance the Gardener first journeyed into the outside world in s Being There.
  Negative
For Haynes, the director of visually stunning but relatively chilly-to-the touch films such as Carol and Far From Heaven, this is arguably as close as hes come to tackling mainstream, audience-friendly fare  but when we get to the payoff moments, I can easily envision a scenario where there wont be a moist eye in the house.

  Negative
So-called cabinets of wonder  enormous cabinets filled with all sorts of artifacts and clues to the past  play a prominent role in Wonderstruck, to the point where we begin to believe theres going to be a supernatural element in these twin stories.
