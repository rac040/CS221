Nobody really knows how the term green room originated, but whether youre relaxing backstage before presenting an Academy Award, awaiting a guest spot on The View or chilling before headlining a sold-out show in Vegas, thats what they call that faux-living room waiting area where you nosh on snacks and chat with friends and go over some pre-show notes.
  Negative
Its the green room.
  Neutral
Even if youre a struggling punk band serving as the opening act at a deep backwoods ramshackle barn festooned with Confederate flags and white supremacist graffiti, theres a green room.
  Negative
Until its a bloody red room.
  Neutral
Writer-director Jeremy Saulniers Green Room is a wonderfully nasty, gruesome, jagged-edge gem of a horror film, with echoes of The Cabin in the Woods, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and The Evil Dead, and so many other films about a group of smart and cynical young people who find themselves cut off from the civilized world and in a bloody mess from which there just might be no escape.
  Negative
Unlike far too many horror filmmakers, Saulnier has the confidence and the skill set to spend a considerable amount of time introducing us to the main characters before anyone suffers so much as a paper cut.
  Neutral
Young millennials Pat Anton Yelchin, Sam Alia Shawkat, Reece Joe Cole and Tiger Callum Turner are the Aint Rights, a hardcore punk band with a cult following but almost no commercial success.
  Negative
Theyre so pure and so badass they refuse to have a social media presence, because they want their fans to be in the moment and not tweeting to them.
  Positive
Theyre so pure and so badass theyll siphon gas to keep their tour van running rather than sell out to The Man.
  Positive
Theyre so pure and so badass they only reluctantly grant an interview to an underground podcaster.
  Neutral
Theyre so full of s'.
  Neutral
One suspects even a couple of the band members know theyre posing as much as theyre performing.
  Negative
After a relatively lucrative show i.e.,  or  total falls through, the cash-poor band accepts a gig playing to a mob of head-banging skinheads in a grungy beer hall in the middle of the woods in Oregon.
  Negative
The moment the Aint Rights van enters the compound, which is teeming with surly, jack-booted types whoseem six days out of prison, their best move would have been to turn around and floor it.
  Negative
But theyre so cool, theyve got this.
  Positive
Ahem.
  Neutral
Once the band is onstage, Pat and Sam take a look at the frothing mob and decide theyll toy with them by kicking off their set with the Dead Kennedys Nazi Punks F' Off.
  Negative
Bad idea.
  Negative
Why not just taunt trained fighter dogs with raw meat, deny them the meat and then forget to lock their cages?
  Negative
Even so, it appears as if the band will be able to take the money and run, no harm, no foul  but Sam has left her cell phone in the green room, and Pat volunteers to retrieve it, and when Pat enters the green room he sees something he wasnt supposed to see '
And thats when the bone-cracking, temple-stabbing, killer-dog-biting bloodshed begins.
  Negative
Patrick Stewart makes a great entrance as Darcy, the owner of the club and the leader of the movement, as he calls it, to restore white pride.
  Positive
As one act of violence begets more violence and the possibility of Darcys entire empire which includes weapons and a LOT of drugs blowing up, Darcy commands his underlings to get rid of the witnesses, aka the Aint Rights, by any means necessary.
  Negative
Of course Darcy and his henchmen are the worst people on the planet  but a couple of the henchmen have possibly redeeming qualities, and its not often we see a movie with conflicted henchmen.
  Negative
Its also kinda great to see the Aint Rights  these smug, pretentious, wannabe punk rockers  thrust into a REAL hardcore situation, which turns one of them into a sniveling crybaby, and makes us more sympathetic to other band members.
  Negative
I loved Imogen Poots work as a tough, seemingly heartless rebel who is a regular at Darcys club and thinks she can handle anything  but shifts into another gear when the bloodshed begins.
  Negative
Alia Shawkat Arrested Development also shines as the sole female member of the Aint Rights.
  Positive
Stewart is a magnificently malevolent presence as Darcy.
  Positive
Macon Blair, who starred in Saulniers Blue Ruin, serves further notice hes a breakout-level talent with his performance as Darcys trusted No.
  Negative
, Gabe.
  Neutral
From the moment Gabe appears onscreen, Blairs subtle and precise acting is a joy to experience.
  Positive
This guy is the real thing.
  Neutral
The cinematography, the set design, the all-important soundtrack, the editing: all first-rate.
  Positive
This is one smart chiller.
  Very positive
