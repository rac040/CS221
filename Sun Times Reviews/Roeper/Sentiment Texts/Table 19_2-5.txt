You see us as a brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess and a criminal.

The Breakfast Club
Not sure if the guests at Table  have ever seen The Breakfast Club, but whether they know it or not, theyve been plunked into a modern-day, wedding-reception takeoff on that John Hughes favorite from the s.
Instead of a brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess and a criminal, the guests at Table  include a bickering couple, a nanny, a dumped princess, a nerd and, yes, a criminal.
  Negative
Strangers sentenced to an afternoon together, at the most remote of tables, far removed from the cool kids  punished for being different and forgotten and misunderstood.
  Negative
Hmmm, I wonder if after initially regarding one another with disdain and indifference, theyll learn each others backstories and bond together against common foes?
  Negative
And just in case we dont get the s influence, the wedding band conveniently plays only covers of 's pop hits such as Dance Hall Days, All Through the Night, Heart and Soul and I Melt With You!
  Negative
The sometimes clunky, sometimes dopey, occasionally sweet and utterly harmless Table  is a Gimmick Movie that takes place nearly entirely during the course of a wedding reception, save for a funny prologue introducing us to some of the characters reacting to the wedding invite, and a neatly packaged epilogue where we find out what happened to those same characters approximately a year after the wedding.
  Negative
Its the kind of movie that will help you kill  minutes in light-chuckle fashion on a flight  and if you have to get up to use the bathroom halfway through, you wont miss all that much.
  Negative
Its the kind of movie you can watch with Mom when it pops up on your Netflix cue.
  Positive
Anna Kendrick, doing that smart-funny-attractive-hyper-sometimes annoying thing she does so well, plays Eloise, best friend of the bride and ex-girlfriend of the brides brother Teddy Wyatt Russell, son of Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn, who were told dumped Eloise via text message shortly before the wedding.
  Negative
What a cad!
  Neutral
Just like that, Eloise goes from maid-of-honor and co-wedding planner to outcast at Table .
  Negative
Probably the best move for Eloise would be to skip the wedding  but then we wouldnt have a movie, would we?
  Negative
Also at Table :
 The great June Squibb plays Jo, the long-ago nanny to the bride.
  Negative
Craig Robinson and Lisa Kudrow are the Kepps, a bickering couple who own a diner in Columbus, Ohio, and have a tenuous connection to the proceedings.
  Negative
Tony Revolori The Grand Budapest Hotel is Renzo, an awkward geek with a domineering mother who pushed him to attend the wedding instead of his junior prom because Mom thinks he has a better chance of scoring with girls that dont actually know him.
  Negative
Rounding out the table is Walter Stephen Merchant, the recently incarcerated nephew of the brides father.
  Negative
Misfits one and all.
  Neutral
One of the problems with Table  is the Anna Kendrick character.
  Negative
Its difficult to like her, especially when she acts like a crazed stalker for the first half of the film.
  Negative
Even when we learn some very predictable things about her situation, were still not entirely sympathetic to her plight.
  Neutral
Same thing with the Kepps.
  Neutral
Theyre so cold and nasty to each other, theres never a point where were rooting for them to rekindle their love.
  Negative
Theyre like that couple you know who are always, always fighting, and all you want them to do is split up so youre not subjected to the collateral damage of their mutual loathing any more.
  Negative
Also, theres some gratuitous and completely unfunny meanness in the depictions of some fringe characters, e.g., the mother of the bride, a sad and bitter alcoholic whose arc goes nowhere.
  Negative
Wrong tone.
  Neutral
To the credit of the script the talented Jay and Mark Duplass wrote the original story, Table  introduces some classic John Hughes movie tropes and then flips our expectations.
  Negative
Thats kind of fun.
  Positive
And even when the movie resorts to pratfalls, reaction shots of a cute dog and other lazy gimmicks, the actors give true and solid performances that sometimes rise above the material.
  Positive
Youve been to worse weddings  and just as many that were more memorable.
  Negative
