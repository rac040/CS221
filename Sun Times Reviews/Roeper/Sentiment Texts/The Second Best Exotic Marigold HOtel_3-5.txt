The title of The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel seems like a sly acknowledgment sequels are almost never equal to the original  but I actually enjoyed this second chapter more than the first, because I was revisiting all those wonderful, cheeky characters from the first film, and I was eager to see what adventures lay in store for them.
