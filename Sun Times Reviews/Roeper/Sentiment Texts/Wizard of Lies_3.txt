Behind bars for the rest of his life, dead to his family, hated by hundreds upon hundreds of victims, Robert De Niros Bernie Madoff is still in semi-denial, still defending himself on some level  still incapable of being completely honest with himself or with the journalist across the table from him.
  Negative
Let me ask you a question, he says.
  Negative
Do YOU think Im a sociopath?
  Neutral
We dont hear an answer.
  Neutral
The lens zooms in for an extreme close-up.
  Neutral
De NiroMadoffs eyes fix on the journalist, and then dart this way and that, ever so slightly.
  Neutral
Its as if Bernie is fighting with all his might from the inside to keep a poker face, and he cant quite do it.
  Positive
What an effective piece of acting from the great De Niro  who, lets be honest, hasnt always come across in later years as if hes giving the full effort to certain roles.
  Positive
Much of De Niros performance in the HBO original film The Wizard of Lies is in close-up, as if the veteran and accomplished director Barry Levinson Rain Man, Diner, 'Wag the Dog is almost daring De Niro to phone it in.
  Negative
He doesnt.
  Positive
Not for a second.
  Neutral
Its finely calibrated acting from one of the all-time best.
  Very positive
Based on the book by Diana B. Henriques who plays herself  quite well  and is in fact the journalist across the table from Madoff in the aforementioned scene, The Wizard of Lies is overlong and repetitive in some stretches, but thanks to De Niros fine work, Levinsons steady direction and the rich, tragic, complex, real-life source material, this is a strong and engrossing piece of filmmaking.
  Positive
The filmmaker doesnt indulge in The Wolf of Wall Street or The Big Short stylistic flashes to explain the intricacies of Madoffs breathtakingly enormous Ponzi scheme, reportedly the largest fraud of its kind in U.S. history.
  Positive
This is more about Madoffs unsettlingly quiet, borderline creepy demeanor, his off-the-charts narcissism, his pathological inability to tell the truth  and the devastating effects the scandal had not only on Madoffs victims, but on his wife, his sons and their families, all of whom are given mostly sympathetic treatment here.
  Negative
We do get a glimpse into how Madoff worked his clients in flashback scenes.
  Negative
The journalist Henriques tries to dig deep into Madoffs core, to find some semblance of true regret, something resembling a conscience.
  Negative
Madoff reminds her he warned his clients not to put ALL of their savings into his hands, because you never know what might happen.
  Negative
Right.
  Neutral
Like your most trusted adviser taking every last dime you ever sweated for, and never looking back.
  Negative
Michelle Pfeiffer plays Madoffs wife Ruth, and as much as I admire so much of what Pfeiffer has done in her career, I found much of her performance distracting, mostly due to a wildly over-the-top accent that sounds as if it was lifted directly from Married to the Mob.
  Negative
Still, Pfeiffer manages to make us feel sorry for Ruth, who lost both of her sons one to cancer, one to suicide in the years after the scandal, and finally stopped visiting Bernie in prison.
  Negative
A scene in which Ruth drives a Meals on Wheels van and ignores Bernies repeated calls probably wont elicit much sympathy from the many, many families that were wiped out by Madoffs greed and utter disregard for humanity  but it comes across as authentic and sad.
  Negative
De Niros fellow Academy Award winner Richard Dreyfuss went for a bigger, showier, flashier performance in last years ABC-TV movie 'Madoff.'
  Negative
Perhaps certain pieces of Madoffs true nature can be found in both portrayals.
  Positive
Neither actor did him any favors, nor does he deserve any.
  Neutral
