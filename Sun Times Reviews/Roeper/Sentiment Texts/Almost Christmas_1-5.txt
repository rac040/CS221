Christmas Day in Almost Christmas is something of a miracle.
  Positive
As in, its a miracle apparently nobody involved in the high-end decision-making process on this film noticed any of the glaring continuity errors or lapses in logic transpiring before us.
  Negative
Example.
  Neutral
One character is dressed in casual clothing.
  Positive
She is standing outside the house in which she grew up.
  Negative
She rushes inside for about  seconds  and when she returns, she has changed into a formal gown, her hairstyle has changed and she is wearing full makeup.
  Positive
Another example.
  Neutral
Someone winds up in the hospital.
  Neutral
A few hours later, that person is home.
  Neutral
That person should still be in the hospital.
  Neutral
Oh, and heres another one.
  Positive
On Christmas night, a congressional candidate and his slick campaign manager meet with a bunch of shady businessmen in a hotel lounge for a power dinner.
  Neutral
Geez, youd think even ambitious politicos and shady businessmen would take Christmas night off!
  Negative
And dont even get me started about the afternoon Christmas dinner during which not one, but two bombshells are dropped  and the reactions around the table range from the slapstick to the overwrought to IT JUST DOESNT MAKE ANY SENSE.
  Negative
What a waste of a wonderful cast.
  Neutral
Count Danny Glover, Gabrielle Union, Nicole Ari Parker, Omar Epps, MoNique, J.B. Smoove, Kimberly Elise, Jessie T. Usher and Romany Malco among those unable to rescue writer-director David E. Talberts family comedydrama, which contains precious few genuine laughs and even fewer legitimately earned heart-tugging moments.
  Positive
This is the kind of movie where a -year misunderstanding could have and would have been cleared up with one simple conversation.
  Negative
This is the kind of movie where a character who has sold out catches a glimpse of a homeless family on the street and says, I cant do this.
  Positive
This is the kind of a movie where a major college football star says things like, When I caught the ball  When I caught the ball?
  Negative
Almost Christmas is set in Birmingham, Alabama it was filmed in Atlanta, and I dont know why they just didnt set it in Atlanta, because theres nothing particularly Birmingham, Alabama, about the story or the setting, where the extended Meyers clan is gathering for the first Christmas since the death of the beloved family matriarch.
  Very negative
Danny Glover is the widower Walter, still unsteady after losing his wife of  years.
  Negative
Walters grown children: Christian Romany Malco, who is running for Congress' Cheryl Kimberly Elise, a successful dentist' Rachel Gabrielle Union, a divorced mom struggling to put herself through law school, and the tagalong, Evan Jessie T. Usher, who were told is a projected Top  NFL draft pick.
  Very negative
Youd think thered be a lot more talk around the house about how Evan is a huge star on the verge of becoming an instant millionaire, but it doesnt really come up.
  Negative
Nicole Ari Parker and J.B. Smoove have Significant Other roles.
  Neutral
MoNique is Walters sister-in-law, a backup singer for everyone from Sly and the Family Stone to the Rolling Stones.
  Negative
That would seem to make her about , but OK.
  Neutral
Oh, and there some Cute Movie Kids who take selfies and text emojis to one another and talk like Cute Movie Kids.
  Positive
Just about everyone has a secret or an issue  or in some cases, a secret issue.
  Neutral
At times Almost Christmas is almost nasty, e.g., the lifelong feud between sisters Cheryl and Rachel, who appear to genuinely hate each other.
  Negative
One of them pulls a stunt on the other thats ugly and unforgivable.
  Negative
On a few, all-too-rare occasions, comedic sparks fly.
  Positive
MoNique has a couple of flat-out funny showcase moments.
  Positive
JB Smoove is too good not to find a few nuggets of comedic gold in his performance.
  Negative
Danny Glover, being Danny Glover, is his usual wonderful screen presence.
  Positive
His portrayal of Walter is the best thing in the movie.
  Very positive
But geez, did they really have to crowbar in a clunky inside joke reference to Glovers Lethal Weapon character?
  Negative
