  Neutral
I could keep going and wed probably touch on ALL the Rockys before it was all over.
  Negative
Suffice to say while Southpaw will surprise almost no one who has seen a fair amount of boxing movies, Fuquas direction and the excellent performances keep the action humming, and despite myself I almost rose up out of my chair a few times during the climactic battle, because I wanted our man Billy Hope to just DESTROY that very, very, very bad man in the ring with him.

Well, if youve seen the ads or the trailer for Southpaw, you already know what goes wrong.
  Negative
Far be it from me to criticize the famously successful marketing team at Weinstein for giving away far too much in the trailer and advertisements for Southpaw'  wait, actually I WILL criticize them for giving away a hugely important and tragic development that happens fairly early in the film.
  Positive
Even if you know whats coming, that scene is powerful and devastating.
  Positive
Now the real story begins.
  Neutral
Gyllenhaal goes deep with his performance, with a touch of Brando-esque mumbling in his line deliveries, and some bursts of rage that would make Sean Penn blush.
  Positive
Occasionally it feels like grandstanding  acting for the sake of getting people to say, Now THATS acting  but overall its immensely effective work.
  Positive
We believe Gyllenhaal as a product of the streets who has become a world-class fighter.
  Negative
He looks really good in the ring.

Fortunately for him, Forest Whitakers Tick Wills runs just the kind of old-school neighborhood gym where a guy like Billy can find redemption and purpose.
  Negative
From the moment Whitaker appears on screen, the role of Tick seems built for Best Supporting Actor talk, and the great one doesnt disappoint.
  Negative
A scene where TickForest explains the deal with his messed-up eye is a tragicomic gem.
  Positive
Meanwhile, weve got  Cent as the obligatory charmingduplicitous fight promoter' the dashing Miguel Gomez as the dastardly, highly skilled opponent Miguel Magic Escobar' Skylan Brooks as the adorable street kid named Hoppy because his mom liked the bunnies, as he explains it, and Naomie Harris as an angelic social services counselor named, well, Angela.

Practically everybody in this movie should have been given less obvious names.

As is the case with even the best boxing films, the fight scenes are wall-to-wall flurries of punches, with each blow sounding like a baseball bat thwacking a leather couch, and more blood than even the most lenient fight doctors would allow.
  Negative
That said, the matches are wildly entertaining, with Gyllenhaal snorting like a mad bull as he paces the ring, measuring his opponents and moving in for the knockout blow.
  Positive
Even when were aware our emotions are being manipulated, were rooting hard for Billy Hope to beat the odds and climb the mountain, because have you seen how movie-adorable his daughter is?
  Negative
Dont they deserve some happiness?
