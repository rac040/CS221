Based on a beloved and bestselling novel and doing everything to make you cry short of flooding theaters with the overwhelming scent of onions, Me Before You is a beautifully filmed and well-intentioned weeper marred by an unfortunate performance from one of the leads, and a plot development that leaves us more angry and frustrated than moved in the final act.

Sam Claflins Will had it all  the looks, the charm, the great job, the moneyed background he grew up in an actual castle, the beautiful girlfriend  until the rainy morning when he was yapping on his cell phone and he walked right into the path of a motorcycle, and now hes a quadriplegic, living on the grounds of his parents estate, alienating one caregiver after another, blasting metal music in his room and hating every second of his existence.

Enter Lou as Wills latest caregiver, and here come the plot references to My Fair Lady, Educating Rita, The Bucket List, Pretty Woman Lou even wears a red dress to a musical performance, ala Julia Roberts and even Dying Young in which Ms. Roberts played a caregiver to a wealthy patient played by Campbell Scott.

Bigger problems with Me Before You include Lous boorish wet blanket of a boyfriend, a self-absorbed clown who makes it REALLY easy for Lou to turn her eyes to Will.
  Negative
Also, scenes in which the audience at a concert and the guests at a wedding reception are horrified by the mere presence of a man in a wheelchair seem way, way over the top.
  Negative
Yes, differently abled individuals must deal with ignorant reactions from some people.

But in Me Before You, the elite and the privileged stare at Will as if they have never seen anyone in a wheelchair and they cant believe he has the nerve to join them in society.
  Negative
And then theres Will himself.
  Neutral
Granted, its beyond our comprehension to fully understand what it must be like to be in the best of health one day and then unable to walk or move ones arms the next.
