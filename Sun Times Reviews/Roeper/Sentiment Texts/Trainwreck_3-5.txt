Amy Schumer is great in bed.
  Positive
Before somebody alerts TMZ or Perez Hilton, lets clarify were talking about Amy Schumer in Trainwreck, and when I say shes great I mean shes flat-out hilarious, whether shes waking up in a strangers bed and saying to herself, Please dont be a dorm room, please don't be a dorm room' coaching her hopeless hunk of a boyfriend through some dirty talk' fumbling through a drunken escapade with an inappropriate partner, or setting the rules for a post-sex sleepover, when all she really wants to do is go home so she can, you know, SLEEP.
  Negative
Written by Schumer and directed by Judd Apatow, Trainwreck is my favorite romantic comedy of the year, and despite or maybe because of all its sharp edges and cynical set pieces, its a movie you want to wrap your arms around, or at least give a high five.
  Positive
Although I dont think you can actually high-five a movie, can you?
  Negative
We know Schumer is one of the smartest and funniest people on the planet based on her stand-up work, her appearances on Howard Sterns show where Apatow heard Schumer and was inspired to make a movie with her and the brilliant Comedy Central series Inside Amy Schumer.
  Positive
So its no surprise Schumer consistently brings the laughs in her debut as a feature film lead.
  Positive
What did take me aback was the range and depth of Schumers performance.
  Positive
From some scathingly raw confrontations with the people who love her the most Amys got some issues to the most moving eulogy in a romantic film since Four Weddings and a Funeral, Schumer delivers one of the best performances Ive seen in any genre of film this year.
  Positive
Schumer plays Amy I didnt even have to IMDB that one!
  Negative
, a New Yorker who writes for a tragically superficial mens magazine called Snuff best worst magazine name ever, which, according to the pitch meetings, sounds like Maxim if Maxim lost its mind.
  Negative
Amys dating a perfectly muscled, sweet but dopey workout maniac named Steven John Cena, who clearly wants to be on the other team but hasnt realized it yet, but shes also aggressively playing the field.
  Negative
Swilling goblets of wine, smoking pot, cracking wise about everyone and everything in her path and then hooking up with a guy  for Amy, thats called Tuesday.
  Positive
In keeping with most Apatow films The -Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up, Trainwreck is overstuffed with supporting characters and meandering day trips into subplots that sometimes have very little to do with the main story.
  Negative
Most of these subplots work.
  Neutral
A very few scenes are deadwood.
  Neutral
A movie within the movie starring Daniel Radcliffe and Marisa Tomei goes nowhere.
  Negative
Bill Hader, another comedic performer with impressive dramatic chops you owe it to yourself to rent The Skeleton Twins, is pure charm and likability as Aaron, a sports surgeon and almost unbearably sweet guy.
  Positive
When Amys Anna Wintour-esque editor Dianna an almost unrecognizable and fantastic Tilda Swinton assigns non-sports fan Amy to do a profile on Aaron, boom, we have our setup and potential first grown-up, actual romance for Amy.
  Positive
This also opens the door to a number of sports-related themes, most notably LeBron James playing a version of himself we hope is close to the real LeBron.
  Positive
Amy has no idea who LeBron is, but LeBron doesnt care about that.
  Negative
All he cares about is his best buddy Aaron, and making sure Amy doesnt break his boys heart.
  Positive
Basically, Aaron has the pretty girl role in this movie, and LeBron is the pretty girls fiercely loyal sidekick.
  Positive
James holds his own in scenes with Hader and Schumer, and thats pretty darn impressive.
  Positive
The casting of the acerbic Colin Quinn as Amys father, a one-time womanizer and party animal whos battling MS, is spot-on.
  Negative
Brie Larson is terrific as Amys sister, who is married to a boring regular guy who has a strange little son.
  Positive
The dynamic between Schumer and Larson is complex and authentic enough to warrant a movie on its own.
  Very positive
Schumers performance is a tour de force of razor-sharp comedic timing.
  Very positive
A Walk of Shame that extends to a Boat Ride of Shame on the Staten Island Ferry is priceless.
  Positive
Little moments, like a discussion of how to properly call for the check, feel just right.
  Positive
Even when the comedy in Trainwreck goes from sublime to broad, we believe Amy and Aaron and the people in their lives could be sitting at the next table in a restaurant, or next to us at a Knicks game.
  Negative
In fact wed want Amy sitting next to us, even if she might cut us with a quip or two.
  Negative
Wed probably deserve it.
  Negative
