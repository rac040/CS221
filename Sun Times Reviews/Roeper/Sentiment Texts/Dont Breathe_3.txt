What a nasty piece of work.
  Very negative
Don't Breathe is an impressively photographed, well-acted, relentlessly paced horror film sure to sicken some and delight others with its twisted sense of humor  and its twisted sense of plot twists, come to think of it.
  Positive
You know how some of the best thrillers are psychological puzzles that play tricks with your mind and feature a minimum of on-screen violence?
  Neutral
Yeah, thats not this movie.
  Negative
Among its other cringe-inducing but impressive feats, Dont Breathe contains one of the  most disgusting scenes Ive ever seen in a horror film, and Im going all the way back to Linda Blairs antics in The Exorcist as a reference point.
  Negative
I dont even need to catalog the hundreds of gross-out, blood-curdling, stomach-churning scenes Ive seen since the s to be absolutely certain this particular moment would have a place in the Top Bottom?

The premise of Don't Breathe is a bit of twist on Wait Until Dark, the  film based on the  play starring Audrey Hepburn as a blind housewife terrorized by three thugs searching for missing heroin.
  Negative
Once again we have three criminals invading a house occupied by a blind individual' from there, the plots diverge wildly.
  Negative
Heres the deal.
  Neutral
Three smug teenage burglars have been targeting upscale homes in the Detroit area.
  Negative
As they wryly note, theyre quickly running out of nice houses to burgle.
  Negative
Theres Money Daniel Zovatto, a trash-talking, quick-tempered wannabe thug' his girlfriend Rocky Jane Levy, who dreams of a big score so she can escape with her little sister to California and get away from her abusive mother, and Alex Dylan Minette, who is clearly in love with Rocky and is the one who provides the keys and the access codes to the houses, because his beloved and hapless pops is a security guard who makes it all too easy for Alex to access that material.
  Very negative
The volatile Money gets a tip about a potential six-figure score involving a blind Gulf War vet Stephen Lang who lives alone on an otherwise abandoned five-square-block stretch of Detroit.
  Negative
Turns out the seemingly feeble and crazy Blind Man hes never given a name had a daughter who was run over and killed by a girl from a wealthy family, and the girls family paid the vet off with a handsome cash settlement.
  Negative
Easy score, right?
  Positive
All the teens have to do is sedate the obligatory growling Rottweiler chained up in the backyard, release a little chloroform into the Blind Mans bedroom while hes sleeping, locate the safe and ta da!
  Negative
Theyll be rich!
  Positive
Suffice to say things go horribly wrong from the get-go, or we wouldnt have a movie called Dont Breathe, would we?
  Negative
Once Money, Rocky and Alex have figured out a way into the extremely well-secured house  a sign they should have heeded  they quickly realize theyre in for a long and possibly bloody night.
  Negative
Yes, they have the advantage of sight over the Blind Man, but he knows every inch of the house, he of course has superior senses of hearing and smell, and even though he looks old enough to be their grandfather, hes a deeply disturbed and physically imposing war veteran with a taste for violence.
  Positive
Best not to creak a floorboard or leave anything lying around he can use as a clue to ascertain your hiding spot.
  Negative
One of the intriguing elements of Dont Breathe is the lack of a clear-cut hero to root for.
  Negative
The character of Money is the most thinly drawn' hes just a jerk.
  Negative
But while we find room to sympathize with Alex and in particular with Rocky, their greed is what put them in this situation  and their greed is what escalates the madness as the night grows bloodier.
  Negative
As for the Blind Man, well.
  Positive
Hes hardly a victim, and well say no more.
  Negative
Talented as they are and as clever as they are with some nifty mid-movie developments, director Fede Alvarez and screenwriter Rodo Sayagues make a mistake, I believe, with a pre-credits sequence that colors our expectations of just about everything that transpires for the remainder of the film, which is essentially one giant flashback.
  Negative
And they traffic in a few too many horror-movie clichs  including the ending  for Dont Breathe to ascend to the instant-classic status some have ascribed to it.
  Negative
Still.
  Neutral
In what is shaping up to a banner year for scary movies, this is another solid and memorable entry.
