Last week at Ebertfest, Chazz Palminteri talked about how difficult it was for the studio to accept Robert De Niro as the director of A Bronx Tale some two decades ago.
  Negative
After all, De Niro had never directed before.
  Negative
But as Palminteri pointed out, the man had spent years on the sets of Martin Scorsese films' surely he had picked up a thing or two.
  Neutral
So it is with The Water Diviner, the feature film directorial debut of Russell Crowe, a favorite of directors such as Ridley Scott and Ron Howard  not to mention a man with a lifetime of experience on film sets.
  Positive
Crowes parents were caterers for movies and TV shows in Australia.
  Neutral
He started hanging around sets when he was .
  Neutral
Indeed, this is the -year-old Crowes first time as a movie director, but hes hardly a novice actor stepping behind the camera for some sort of vanity project.
  Negative
The experience shows with The Water Diviner, a first-rate post-World War I drama with a heavy dose of sentiment and a gripping storyline.
  Positive
This is an indie film disguised as a sweeping epic.
  Positive
Filmed on a limited budget, with a talented, diverse cast of actors who other than Crowe are far from household names in the States, this is a strikingly beautiful, unabashedly melodramatic and at times shamelessly old-fashioned story.
  Positive
Theres no defending that obtuse title, and it might be a tough sell to get American audiences into the theater to see a story about a search for the bodies of Australian soldiers in Gallipoli in , but the core themes of The Water Diviner echo movies from Casablanca to Paths of Glory.
  Negative
Looking muscular but bulky and world-weary, Crowe plays Joshua Connor, an Australian farmer with an uncanny gift for finding water deep underground, using only a crudely fashioned stick and his instincts.
  Negative
Joshua sent all three of his young sons off to war in Turkey as if they were embarking on a grand adventure, a la 'The Arabian Nights,' the book he read to them countless times when they were boys.
  Negative
He is paralyzed with regret over that day.
  Negative
None of the three make it home.
  Negative
Bound to keep a promise to his deceased wife, Joshua makes the trek from Australia to Turkey, determined to find the remains of his boys and bring them home.
  Negative
The gifted cinematographer Andrew Lesnie, who shot the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit films, does nomination-worthy work here, shifting colors and filters to capture the breathtaking and endless blue skies of Australia' the claustrophobic, terrifying and bloody flashback sequences in the battle of Gallipoli, and the bustling, tension-filled, exotic profile of Istanbul, where smoke and dust dance in the air, the streets are jam packed with merchants and protesters, and there are precious few quiet pockets in the entire city.
  Positive
Joshua takes up residence in a hotel thats seen better days and a much higher occupancy rate.
  Negative
Conveniently enough for a romantic subplot, the proprietor is the gorgeous and kindly AysheOlga Kurylenko, whose husband has been missing and presumed dead for years.
  Negative
Ayshehas a precocious -year-old son, Orhan, who takes an instant liking to Joshua.
  Positive
We can see the plot machinations turning as Joshua rediscovers his paternal side, and Ayshegazes approvingly from across the hotel courtyard.
  Negative
If only they werent from such different worlds!
  Neutral
Can romance even be discussed?
  Neutral
Hmmmm.
  Neutral
Actually, more screen time is devoted to the dynamic between Joshua and the Turkish Major Hasan Yilmaz Erdogan, excellent, now tasked with helping the former enemy uncover and identity the remains of their fallen soldiers.
  Positive
At one point Joshua explodes with rage at Major Hasan, spitting and screaming, You killed my beautiful boys!
  Negative
Major Hasan respectfully but forcefully replies it was Joshua who sent his sons to Major Hasans country, to invade his land, to try to kill his countrymen.
  Negative
Crowe is well suited to the role of the stoic, bullheaded, loving, grieving father who refuses to listen to reason and ignores the madness of a quest to find his sons among the skeletal remains of thousands of long-dead soldiers.
  Negative
Olga Kurylenko, perhaps best known to American audiences as a Bond woman in Quantum of Solace, does fine work as a woman torn between loyalty to the memory of her husband and her undeniable feelings for Joshua.
  Positive
Jacqueline McKenzie, who worked with Crowe -plus years ago in Romper Stomper, does unforgettable work in a small but pivotal role as Joshuas wife, who is destroyed by her grief for her boys.
  Positive
When people say, They dont make movies like this any more, well, sometimes they do.
  Positive
