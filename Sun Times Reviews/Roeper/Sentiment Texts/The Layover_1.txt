You gotta pick one:
Ah, not so fast!
  Neutral
Before you choose Option B., allow me to tell you a few things about The Layover.
  Negative
Yes, it is a movie.
  Positive
But just barely so.
  Negative
Id say its more like an excruciating, embarrassing, profoundly unfunny, poorly shot and astonishingly tone-deaf screech-fest featuring some of the least charismatic performances this side of one of those dreadful reality shows in which over-injected women always seem to be yelling at one another while pouring wine or throwing wine at one another.
  Negative
The Layover is a would-be romp starring Kate Upton from The Other Woman and, um, the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue, and Alexandra Daddario from Baywatch and The House, two of the most dreadful comedies of  and also of all time.
  Negative
No offense, Ms. Daddario, but we can add The Layover to that list as well.
  Negative
All right, so we know Kate Upton and Alexandra Daddario arent exactly Tina Fey and Amy Poehler  but nothing can prepare one for how amateurish they are in this movie.
  Negative
They deliver the kind of performances that would have casting directors at an open audition for a third-rate sitcom checking their phones and tapping their feet, waiting for them to stop reading so they can say, Thank you, well be in touch.
  Positive
Upton plays Meg and Daddario plays Kate.
  Negative
Think about that for a second.
  Neutral
Even the simple act of naming these characters is needlessly complicated and distracting.
  Negative
Every time Kates character says, Kate, were reminded thats hername in real life.
  Negative
Why not just call Kate Kate, or better yet, find a name other than Kate to avoid this problem altogether?
  Negative
Anyway.
  Neutral
Meg and Kate are best friends who have have suffered multiple personal setbacks recently, so Meg persuades Kate they should fly to Florida, self-medicate and forget all their troubles.
  Negative
Heres a scene for ya.
  Neutral
When the women get to the TSA checkpoint, Meg is told she cant keep her bottle of PRODUCT PLACEMENT ALERT Dr. Pepper.
  Negative
So  Meg chugs down the whole bottle, as everyone in line looks on with amazement  I mean, utter amazement, as if Meg is guzzling a gallon of gasoline.
  Negative
How and why is that even a scene?
  Neutral
The payoff comes in the form of Meg belching again and again on the plane.
  Positive
Heeeelarious.
  Neutral
Meg gets an aisle seat.
  Positive
Kate gets the window.
  Neutral
The middle seat is occupied by Ryan Matt Barr, redefining bland, a blond, bearded hunk with a perpetually dopey expression and a relatively limited vocabulary.
  Negative
From that moment forward, Kate and Meg are reduced to blithering, bickering nincompoops willing to smash their longtime friendship to smithereens in the name of scoring with this guy.
  Negative
Meg in particularly is downright nasty and nearly sadistic in the ways she manipulates and psychologically tortures poor Kate.
  Very negative
Their flight is diverted to St. Louis due to a hurricane.
  Negative
Obviously not the fault of the filmmakers, but talk about bad timing for that particular plot device.
  Negative
During the layover, Meg and Kate continue to get wasted and to make up stories about themselves and to step over one another in order to impress dopey Ryan and his dopey knockoff Owen Wilson hair.
  Negative
Of all the horrible moments in The Layover, the worst is when Kate finds herself drenched in excrement, screaming M'''-!
  Negative
while attempting to rinse off with a garden hose.
  Neutral
One is tempted to say, Pass the garden hose, Kate.
  Positive
The weirdest thing about The Layover is the director is William H. Macy, the brilliant character actor who owns comedy on the Showtime series Shameless.
  Very positive
William H. Macy is great.
  Positive
William H. Macy knows funny.
  Positive
How could William H. Macy direct such an unholy mess?
  Negative
That mystery will have to go unsolved.
  Positive
Id rather revisit that hypothetical layover at OHare than give this movie any further thought.
  Negative
