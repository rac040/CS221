Any time a giant superhero movie makes time for self-referential humor, not to mention nods to A Long Days Journey Into Night AND the graffiti artist known as Banksy, count me in.
  Negative
Avengers: Age of Ultron is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another.
  Positive
It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe.
  Positive
Rarely has a comic book movie struck such a precise balance between legitimate character development, crackling good humor, genuine peril and good old-fashioned big-screen entertainment.
  Very positive
The thing about these all-star Marvel superhero movies is theyre incredibly complicated and often convoluted  but exceedingly simple at the same time.
  Positive
Somewhere along the way, one is almost certain to get dizzy from all the talk about Lokis scepter and infinity stones and artificial intelligence and the role of S.H.I.E.L.D. in the grand scheme of things  but you know its all going to come down to a mega-battle in which the forces of good go up against the forces of evil, who always seem intent on blowing up the whole darn planet.
  Negative
Writer-director Joss Whedon has the vibranium touch thats a good thing, I think when it comes to striking the box-office-gold balance between appealing to the casual summer movie fan as well as the hardcore, cosplaying, Im going to spend Tuesday AND Wednesday on comment threads fanboys and fangirls.
  Negative
And thats why this movie will gross somewhere between  billion and  billion before the start of football season.
  Negative
At times, Avengers: Age of Ultron gets so dense with the plot machinations, I was reaching for the Advil to stop the pounding in my head.
  Negative
Just as often, I sat back, adjusted the -D glasses and enjoyed the cutting-edge special effects, the elaborate battle sequences and the Oceans -type banter among Iron Man, Captain America, Black Widow and company.
  Very positive
By the house of Odin, who knew the Mighty Thor was so funny?
  Positive
Hes the life of the party in a scene where his fellow Avengers attempt to lift his hammer, to hilarious results.
  Positive
Age of Ultron starts in the Eastern European nation of Sokovia, where one Baron Wolfgang von Strucker Thomas Krestschmann has been using Lokis scepter to conduct evil experiments.
  Negative
His prize subjects are the twins PietroQuicksilver Aaron Taylor-Johnson, who can move faster than the human eye can fathom, and WandaScarlet Witch Elizabeth Olsen, who can literally get into your mind and also has a kind of Carrie-esque ability to ruin a party.
  Negative
The twins hate the Avengers, and they really love each other.
  Positive
In a different movie, that relationship would be fodder for deep therapy.
  Negative
Then again, everyone in THIS movie needs five sessions a week and then some.
  Neutral
After the Avengers gain control of the scepter, Tony Stark Robert Downey Jr., in prime quipping form and Bruce Banner the always excellent Mark Ruffalo seize the opportunity to use it create a new, elevated form of artificial intelligence.
  Negative
Bad idea.
  Negative
The result is Ultron voiced by James Spader, who is perhaps more powerful and smarter than anything the Avengers have ever encountered, and heres the really bad news: Ultron believes the only way for the planet to evolve is for the Avengers, and most of the human race, to perish.
  Positive
With a running time of  minutes, Avengers: Age of Ultron has the luxury of devoting time to subplots involving Hawkeye Jeremy Renner and Black Widow Scarlett Johansson, not to mention a beat or two for Anthony Mackies Falcon, Samuel L. Jacksons Nick Fury, Don Cheadles James Rhodes and Claudia Kims Helen Cho.
  Negative
Theres a little bit of family drama, a sprinkling of romance and a startling reminder many of these superheroes arent immortal.
  Positive
Some of the sharpest exchanges are between Tony Stark and Chris Evans Steve Rogers, who is literally from a bygone generation and has some major problems with Starks philosophies.
  Negative
We also get the obligatory wisecracking among the superheroes even when theyre in the middle of battle, but Whedon knows when to pull back on the barbs and acknowledge that every time these flying maniacs do battle with armies of evil, the collateral damage in human lives could number in the millions.
  Negative
Theres also a weird, trippy sequence more suited to a horror movie than a comic book adventure, with Thor, Cap and Black Widow individually experiencing some really heavy lucid dreams.
  Negative
Its pretty bizarre and pretty great.
  Positive
Marvel veterans Downey, Hemsworth, Ruffalo et al. deliver their usual stellar work.
  Positive
Avengers newbies Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany as Jarvis and then some deliver fine performances.
  Positive
And other than a few moments when I just didnt buy the Hulk why is the Hulk so hard to CGI?
  Negative
, the special effects are spectacular.
  Positive
Some day, an Avengers film might collapse under the weight of its own awesomeness.
  Negative
I mean, how many times can they save the world?
  Negative
But this is not that day.
