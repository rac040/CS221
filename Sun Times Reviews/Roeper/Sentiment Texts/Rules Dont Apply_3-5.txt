After decades of toying with the idea of a movie about Howard Hughes, Warren Beatty finally plays Hughes in Rules Dont Apply, but this is most definitely not a biopic of the famously eccentric billionaire.
  Negative
Its a mostly old-fashioned love story set in the Hollywood of the late s, starring two young talents on the rise who have such an abundance of acting chops, looks and that elusive thing known as movie-star magnetism, they could have been successful movie actors in any era.
  Positive
Lily Collins The Blind Side, Mirror, Mirror who bears a slight resemblance to the young Audrey Hepburn, is the plucky and nave but grandly ambitious actress-hopeful Marla Mabrey.
  Negative
A small-town beauty queen and aspiring songwriter and actress, Marla arrives in Hollywood at the behest of the legendary businessman and studio head Hughes, who ensconces her and her mother Annette Bening in a lovely home, where they are to wait, and wait  and WAIT, for the great mans call for Marla to come audition.
  Positive
Note: In reality Hughes had already sold his interest in RKO Studios a few years before the events of Rules Dont Apply, but as an opening quote in the movie, attributed to Hughes himself, puts it, Never check an interesting fact.
  Negative
This movie is pure fiction.
  Positive
Alden Ehrenreich Hail, Caesar!
  Negative
, Blue Jasmine, the future Han Solo is the earnest, energetic and equally ambitious Frank Forbes, a driver in Mr. Hughes fleet who is pleased as punch to have the job  even though, like most of Hughes employees, hes never actually met the man.
  Negative
Frank is given the assignment of squiring Marla about town.
  Neutral
As a cynical, world-weary senior driver named Levar Matthew Broderick constantly reminds Frank, the chauffeurs are strictly forbidden from socializing with any of the dozens of wannabe starlets Mr. Hughes has put up in various homes and hotel bungalows in and around Hollywood.
  Negative
Of course, that doesnt stop Frank from falling in love with Marla, because sometimes, as the song in the movie goes, Rules Dont Apply.
  Negative
Played mostly for farce with some dark undertones and directed by Beatty as a kind of love letter to his own early days as a rising star, Rules Dont Apply is mostly about the love story between Frank and Marla, set in a time when traditional American Puritanism and the burgeoning Sexual Revolution were about to clash head-on.
  Negative
Although Beattys Hughes is a near mythic presence hovering over almost every conversation and influencing nearly every decision made by characters major and minor, were a half-hour into the movie before he makes an appearance  and for much of the rest of the story, hes behind a curtain or in the shadows or barking out commands over the telephone or shrouded in darkness.
  Negative
As played by Beatty, the increasingly eccentric Hughes is a smart and powerful man, but hes also a bit of a silly fool, toying with the lives of his employees and obsessing over flavors of ice cream like a -year-old throwing a tantrum.
  Negative
Frank is a devout Methodist engaged to his hometown sweetheart, Sarah Taissa Farmiga, whose strict parents frown upon Franks Hollywood job.
  Neutral
Ed Harris and Amy Madigan, married in real life for more than  years, play Sarahs dad and mom.
  Negative
Marla is a Southern Baptist who talks openly about her virginity and her religious values.
  Neutral
None of that is enough to douse their chemistry.
  Negative
Theres never a glance between them that shouldn't be prefaced with simmering.

  Negative

  Positive
Dabney Coleman and Steve Coogan and Paul Sorvino each get about two minutes worth of screen time.
  Negative
Thanks in large part to the sublime work of cinematographer Caleb Deschanel The Black Stallion, The Right Stuff, The Patriot and writer-director Beattys obvious familiarity with the time period and the subject matter, Rules Don't Apply is a great-looking film with all the right visual touches for the era.
  Negative
The romance between Marla and Frank gets a bit dark for what had been mostly a romp until that point, and the ending isnt quite as romantic as one might hope, but thanks in large part to the enormously appealing leads and the legendary Hollywood figure playing a one of the legendary figures of the th century, Rules Dont Apply is a sweet and entertaining slice of old Hollywood.
