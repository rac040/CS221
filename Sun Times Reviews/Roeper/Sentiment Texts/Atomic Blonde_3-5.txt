This is the recipe for the quite ridiculous, ultra-violent and deliriously entertaining Atomic Blonde, a slick vehicle for the magnetic, badass charms of Charlize Theron, who is now officially an A-list action star on the strength of this film and Mad Max: Fury Road.
  Very positive
Shes a drop-dead bombshell who will drop you dead before you know what hit you.
  Negative
Based on the graphic novel 'The Coldest City' and directed by David Leitch, whose resume includes stunt double work for Brad Pitt on five films and reportedly co-directing John Wick, though he didnt receive an official credit, Atomic Blonde is set in  Berlin  an inspired backdrop, given the Wall was about to come tumbling down, the streets were pulsating with electric tension, and Leitch gets an excuse to set extended action sequences to the sounds of Father Figure,  Luftballoons, Voices Carry and Under Pressure.
  Negative
From the get-go, Atomic Blonde announces itself as a self-consciously stylized and absolutely derivative thriller.
  Negative
The first song Leitch features is Cat People Putting Out Fire by the great David Bowie  the title song of the  erotic horror film by Paul Schrader.
  Negative
How many movies have the, um, audacity, to kick off with the title tune from another film?
  Negative
Atomic Blonde is framed by one of the most time-honored storytelling devices: The lead character in this case Therons super-spy Lorraine Broughton is brought in for questioning after an operation has gone haywire, and as she spins her story, we flash back to recent events.
  Negative
And what a tangled, convoluted, nearly headache-inducing story she weaves.
  Negative
Lorraine has there ever been a more mundane name for a secret agent?
  Negative
arrives in Berlin on assignment from Her Majestys Secret Service.
  Neutral
Her mission is to gain possession of the obligatory list revealing the names, locations and other personal information of Allied spies around the globe.
  Negative
They might as well have called the list The MacGuffin, as it is the classic example of Hitchcocks object that serves as the device to keep the plot humming.
  Negative
Five minutes after arriving in the city, Lorraine is fighting for her life  setting the tone for a film that rarely takes its foot off the accelerator.
  Negative
The Berlin of Atomic Blonde is bubbling over with spies and hired assassins and double agents and mysterious operatives.
  Negative
Lorraines British contact is the wild card David Percival James McAvoy, who seems to be working every angle possible and whose loyalties are called into question very early on.
  Negative
Its possible David will become a love interest for Lorraine.
  Positive
Its also possible hell try to have her killed.
  Negative
Maybe both.
  Neutral
Hmmm, how many times have we seen that in the James Bond canon of films?
  Negative
Eddie Marsan Ray Donovan delivers fine work as Spyglass, a Russian traitor who claims to have memorized that entire list of intelligence operatives.
  Positive
Sofia Boutella, who was hopelessly lost in that dreadful Mummy movie, is captivating as Delphine Lasalle these names!
  Very positive
, an untested French spy who has a major crush on Lorraine, and she returns the favor in a big way.
  Negative
My money is on Boutella and Theron to win the coveted Best Kiss trophy at the MTV Movie Awards.
  Positive
Thats still a thing, right?
  Neutral
Director Leitch has a keen sense of pacing.
  Positive
When he cuts back to the interrogation scenes, with Toby Jones as Lorraines British supervisor and John Goodman as the CIAs representative, they react as if theyve just witnessed the scene Lorraine has described to them.
  Negative
Jones expression after Lorraine outlines her relationship with Delphine is priceless.
  Positive
The visuals in Atomic Blonde pop right off the screen.
  Negative
Leitch periodically zooms in for tight close-ups of the stunning Theron, who conveys a world of emotions with a subtle movement of the eyes.
  Positive
After a middle section that lags just a bit, things kick up another notch  make that about  notches  with a fantastically entertaining and brutally funny fight sequence that would have even Jason Bourne gasping for breath.
  Positive
In an apartment and then on a staircase, Lorraine takes on one henchman after another, crying out in guttural rage as she punches and kicks and shoots and stabs her way to survival.
  Negative
At one point the mere act of standing up sends her to the ground as she collapses like a marionette with the strings cut loose.
  Negative
The camerawork in that sequence is cinematic jazz  amazing to behold.
  Very positive
Not every twist in Atomic Blonde is as twisty as the filmmakers might have envisioned.
  Negative
And there are so many bad guys the evil quotient is a bit diluted.
  Negative
If theres a truly worthy adversary to the ATOMIC BLONDE, itll have to be in a sequel.
  Negative
And we definitely need a sequel.
  Positive
