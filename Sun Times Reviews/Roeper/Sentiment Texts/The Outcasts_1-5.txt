In the opening scene of the Mean Girls knockoff titled The Outcasts, our heroine tells us about life at Richard Nixon High School, as we see a plaque in front of the school telling us its The Home of the Minutemen.
  Positive
Theres even a statue of a Minuteman atop the brick wall, with tarnished brass letters telling us this is indeed Richard Milhous Nixon High School.
  Negative
A nerdy kid is dangling by his backpack from the Minutemans rifle.
  Negative
OK, what?
  Neutral
Whats the connection between Nixon and '
Never mind.
  Neutral
In literally the first minute of this movie, our expectations are lowered into believing this is going to be a broad, jokey comedy with no interest in reflecting anything resembling anyones high school experience.
  Negative
That assumption would be spot on.
  Neutral
The Outcasts is not a good movie but it is quite the curiosity for a number of reasons, for example:
When is this movie taking place?
  Negative
After Victoria Justices Jodi tells us about how Richard Nixon High has the usual collections of cliques and stereotypes, not to mention the obligatory popular-beautiful-sadistic girl named Whitney Claudia Lee whoruns the school, Jodi meets up with her geeky-brilliant best friend Mindy Eden Sher, who says  X-Files is on tonight!
  Negative
and laments she has a family Jazzercise class that evening.
  Positive
We then cut to Jodi in her bedroom, logging onto what appears to be an early edition of an iMac.
  Negative
Based on these cultural clues, one can assume The Outcasts takes place in the late s or early s, yes?
  Negative
But then Jodi has this to say to her computer about the song shes about to play: Id rather admit Taylor Swifts music has touched my cold dark heart than show it to anybody.
  Negative
And then we get cell phones and references to the actor Adam Scott and Instagram and The Big Bang Theory and other indications this movie is actually set in the now.
  Positive
What is happening!?!
  Neutral
Anyway.
  Neutral
After the horrible terrible nasty mean-spirited Whitney subjects Jodi and Mindy to a humiliating prank at a party, Jodi and Mindy and their fellow outcasts organize a revolution against the status quo.
  Very negative
Most of the characters look like theyre in their s and talk in speeches and one-liners that sound penned by writers in their s. Justices Jodi sports a wacky hat and glasses and bangs, as if she has seen every teen movie about the wallflower who blossoms in a slow-motion walk down the staircase.
  Positive
Frank Whaley plays her single father, who exists mainly to have heart-to-heart talks with his daughter as she rolls her eyes.
  Neutral
Once the outcasts turn the tables on the popular kids, it leads to some not-so-shocking revelations and some fractures in longtime relationships.
  Positive
And yes, theres a big prom scene, and the pop culture references keep on coming fast and furious without being particularly clever, and lessons are learned and all that jazz.
  Negative
Before it was even over, I was already forgetting about it.
