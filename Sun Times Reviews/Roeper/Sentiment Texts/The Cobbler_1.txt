very once in a while, Adam Sandler eschews the baby-talk shtick and the scatological gags and the horrendous scripts in favor of actually doing some acting.
  Negative
Punch-Drunk Love , Spanglish , Reign Over Me , Funny People , Men, Women amp' Children : In each of these films, Sandler inhabited a character and proved to be quite capable as a dramatic actor.
  Positive
He has a certain, natural pathos that cant be taught.
  Positive
The Cobbler represents Sandlers latest effort to create a meaningful character, and its certainly a solar system away from disposable garbage such as Blended and Thats My Boy and The Grown-Ups movies  but it is a misfire of spectacular proportions, a film so unspeakably disastrous it might be just be the worst Adam Sandler movie ever made.
  Very negative
This is one of the weirdest fables Ive ever seen  a journey that takes the wrong path at every turn before a final act so insanely stupid and insulting they might as well have had the actors turn to the camera and give us a collective raspberry.
  Negative
Sandler plays Max Simkin, a fourth-generation cobbler on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.
  Negative
Max is so burdened by the bland sadness of his existence he can barely muster the energy to look at his customers or lift his feet when hes shuffling along.
  Negative
Every morning, Max opens his shop and endures the prying questions of the barber Steve Buscemi next door.
  Negative
Every night, Max returns home to care for his ailing mother Lynn Cohen in Sheepshead Bay.
  Negative
And nearly every step of the way, bouncy klezmer music plays in the background.
  Positive
Method Man gives an embarrassing performance as a vicious thug named Ludlow, who beats his girlfriend, terrorizes the neighborhood and threatens to kill Max if Max doesnt have his shoes repaired in timely fashion.
  Negative
Late one night, as Max tries to repairs Ludlows alligator loafers, his stitching machine breaks down, and Max has to use an ancient machine once operated by his great-grandfather.
  Negative
Once the alligator shoes are repaired, Max tries them on, and presto!
  Negative
He looks just like Ludlow.
  Negative
Its still Max inside, but when he walks out the door, everyone thinks hes Ludlow.
  Negative
Max discovers he can transform into any of his customers  as long as the customer is a size .
  Negative
Conveniently, just about everyone seems to be a  .
  Negative
And what does Max do with this magical power?
  Positive
He goes Full Creepy, Borderline Racist and Borderline Rapist.
  Negative
Just a few of the scenarios, and I swear Im not making this up:
Max dons shoes worn by his father played by Dustin Hoffman!
  Negative
, who abandoned the family years ago, so he can transform into his father and have a romantic dinner with his mother.
  Positive
Oedipal much?
  Neutral
As Ludlow, Max confronts a white businessman and demands the guy give him his shoes, so Max can take the white guys luxury car for a joyride.
  Negative
Max dons the shoes of a handsome Brit Dan Stevens and enters his apartment, where he encounters the Brits gorgeous girlfriend in the shower.
  Positive
She invites him to join her and Max is all for it  until he realizes that if he takes off his shoes, hell transform back into Max.
  Negative
In other words, Max was all too willing to effectively rape this woman because she thought he was her boyfriend.
  Negative
What a guy.
  Neutral
And yet through all these uncomfortable, unfunny, bizarre and distasteful tableaux, Im assuming were supposed to be rooting for Max the underdog.
  Negative
Granted, Max does try to perform some good deeds while inhabiting the soles of others get it, solessouls?
  Negative
, but even then, his methodology is inexplicable.
  Negative
The Cobbler goes from bad to you-have-to-be-kidding in that final act, when were given a big reveal that makes no sense, even in the context of a bat-bleep crazy fable.
  Negative
Perhaps the most astonishing thing about The Cobbler is it was written and directed by the deeply talented Tom McCarthy, writer of the animated treasure Up and writer-director of wonderful films such as The Station Agent, The Visitor and Win Win.
  Very positive
No doubt McCarthy will rebound from this nightmare.
  Negative
Hes far too gifted a filmmaker to continue down this rabbit hole.
  Negative
As for Sandler, he tried.
  Neutral
