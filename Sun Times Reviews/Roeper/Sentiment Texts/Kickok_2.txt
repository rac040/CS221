Sometimes it takes a good man to stop bad people.

Words of semi-wisdom from an elder statesman in Hickok.
  Negative
If you give Hickok a try expecting to see the hunky Aussie best known for playing Thor, or the hunky Aussie best known for the 'Hunger Games movies, please know this movie does not star Chris Hemsworth, nor does it star Liam Hemsworth.
  Negative
This one features their older brother Luke.
  Neutral
You might know Luke from the HBO series Westworld.
  Neutral
You might not know him at all.

Despite all of Hemsworths wincing and growling and squinting and barking and guttural howls, it felt like he was delivering a grade-B take on Clint Eastwood in a grade-B Western.
  Negative
Also, every time LukeWild Bill takes off his shirt  and that happens quite a bit in this film  he looks more like a former college linebacker than a denizen of the American Midwest circa the s and s. Was he bench-pressing horses and using a straight razor to eliminate all torso hair?
  Negative
Directed by Timothy Woodward Jr., written by Michael Lanahan and featuring an entertaining supporting cast dotted with some pretty big names, Hickok is not without its corny, borderline-cheesy moments of fun  but it eventually loses steam due to the increasingly clich-riddled story developments, not to mention the awkwardly edited shootouts that sometimes make it seem as if the combatants filmed their scenes on separate days.
  Negative
After a prologue set during the Civil War, featuring an overwrought score and some bad acting, we find Wild Bill Hickok on the run from the law as he rides into Abilene, Kansas, which just might be the roughest and rowdiest and most lawless town in all the land.
  Very negative
Popular country musician Trace Adkins hams it up as Phil Poe, an evil cuss with really, really long hair and a mean streak a mile wide.
  Negative
Poe is with Cameron Richardsons Mattie, who of course doesnt dare tell Poe about her long-ago past with Wild Bill  but that doesnt stop Poe from suspecting shes hiding something.
  Negative
That Poe, he wasnt born yesterday.
  Positive
Hunter Fischer plays Matties young son Joey as if hes been instructed to do a parody of every tow-headed kid in every Western movie and TV show from days gone by.
  Negative
Bill is my hero!
  Neutral
Joey says over and over.
  Negative
Its a wonder Joey doesnt run after Bill shouting, Shane!
  Positive
I mean Bill!
  Neutral
Come back!

My favorite performance in the film comes from Bruce Dern, enthusiastically loopy as the booze-soaked town doctor.
  Very positive
You can rarely accuse Bruce Dern of phoning it in.
  Negative
I also enjoyed Kris Kristofferson as Bills world-weary mentor although Kristofferson MIGHT be phoning it in at times, and Kaiwi-Lyman Mersereau as John Wesley Hardin, a more interesting and complex figure than Hickok, at least in this telling of the tale.
  Positive
Also, kudos to the wardrobe people for outfitting one particular group of hired henchmen in the most fabulous matching tan gunslinger outfits.
  Negative
Its as if inspiration came from vintage J. Peterman catalogs.
