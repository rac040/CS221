You cant trust your first impressions in Midnight Special, and I mean that in the best possible way.
  Positive
In a modern movie universe where so many stories are reboots, sequels, retreads or depressingly predictable, its refreshing to find yourself immersed in a film that zigs and zags between genres  and occasionally zaps your senses with an electric charge of shock and awe.
  Positive
With echoes of Steven Spielbergs Close Encounters of the Third Kind and John Carpenters Starman, anda dash of early M. Night Shyamalan sprinkled in for good measure, writer-director Jeff Nichols fourth feature film after Shotgun Stories, Take Shelter and Mud and first major studio production confirms Nichols standing as one of the original newer voices in film today.

  Neutral
He wears night-vision goggles so he can turn off the headlights and render the car virtually invisible.
  Negative
Alton wears protective goggles as well  but for entirely different, perhaps supernatural reasons.

  Negative

  Neutral
The truth is out there.
  Neutral
Actually, it reveals itself at the end of the journey.
  Positive
Nichols wisely doesnt attempt to answer every single question you might find yourself asking  but he doesnt leave you hanging, either.
  Negative
Michael Shannon is such a screen-filling, hulking presence, and his natural fallback expression is so intimidating, it takes a while to warm up to him here as a fiercely devoted father, but Shannon is up to the task and then some.
  Positive
In one of the films quieter and most touching moments, Alton tells his father to stop worrying about him and his dad says thats never going to happen, and besides, I kinda like worrying about you.
  Positive
Edgertons work is equally impressive.
  Very positive
His Lucas seems like your typical loyal sidekick who doesnt do much thinking on his own and finds himself in over his head  but then Lucas shows us another side.
  Neutral
Adam Stones cinematography is beautiful and sharp.
  Positive
Stone does a terrific job of lensing in the dark without keeping us in the dark.
  Positive
The editing by Julie Monroe is crisp and well timed' on at least two occasions, I was genuinely shocked by developments, in great part because of the way the scenes were cut.
  Positive
The title is not a good one, and the penultimate scene was less than perfect.
  Negative
End of my misgivings about this sharp and enthralling piece of filmmaking.
