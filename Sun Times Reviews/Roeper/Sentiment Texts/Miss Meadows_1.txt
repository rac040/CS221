  Negative
Even when the movie is awful, I believe its part of the job to stay through the bitter end, so I can give you a full menu of reasons why you should stay away.
  Very negative
However, had I seen this movie as a fan, with no obligation to write about it or talk about it or ever think about it, I would have bolted halfway through.
  Neutral
Katie Holmes, beautiful and looking like shes about four years out of Dawsons Creek, plays the title character, a preschool teacher who dresses like shes in a s television show, wears taps on her shoes and is prone to breaking into a little dance at any given moment, and talks with perfectly articulated grammar in a squeaky-cute voice.

Miss Meadows is something of a live-action cartoon character.

Bluebirds literally follow her around, and deer prance on the suburban lawns as she walks the neighborhood.

Her parting catch phrase to acquaintances is always, Toodle-oo.
  Positive
Oh, and she carries a small pistol in her purse, and she is an amazingly accurate shot.
  Positive
You see, Miss Meadows is Mary Poppins with a Death Wish.

Like just about everyone else who comes into contact with Miss Meadows, this guy is slow to realize what should be obvious about two minutes after meeting this gal.
  Negative
Shes bonkers.
  Neutral
In addition to the whole tap-dancing thing, Miss Meadows has a penchant for taking every little phrase literally, as if English is her second language.
  Negative
But shes a schoolteacher, so how could she not be familiar with common figures of speech?
  Negative
Attempts to explain the roots of Miss Meadows psychotic ways only serve to muddle the picture.

  Neutral
And we get lazy stereotypes about a priest and an ice cream truck driver, and their utterly unsurprising surprising dark sides.
  Negative
Of course an indie satire isnt going for authenticity, but Miss Meadows with her little pea-shooter is more deadly at medium range than an Army Ranger with an M rifle.
  Negative
Its ridiculous.
  Negative
Holmes is a gamer in the role, but its really a one-note deal.
  Negative
Miss Meadows is prim and proper, she speaks to everyone like theyre one of the -year-olds in her class, she has that annoying tap-dancing habit and beneath the Disney princess persona, shes wrestling with some ugly demons.

We got it after the first half hour.
