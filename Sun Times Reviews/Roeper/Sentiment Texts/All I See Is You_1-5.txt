Please dont ask me to choose my favorite off-the-rails moment in All I See Is You.
  Negative
I have equal love for all of them!
  Positive
Heres a sample platter, which is by no means all-inclusive:
 During a bout of kinky sex, Blake Livelys Gina asks her husband James Jason Clarke what he thinks about when hes, um, alone.
  Negative
You and only you, he responds.
  Neutral
What about you?
  Neutral
Lets just say her response is the response no man ever wants to hear.
  Neutral
It would be a hilarious comedic moment, except its not supposed to be funny.
  Neutral
Ginas sister Carol Ahna OReilly lives in Spain with her husband Ramon Miguel Fernandez, who apparently is an artist of some sort.
  Negative
Theyre all supposed to be getting ready to go out on the town, but first Ramon gets naked, covers himself in red paint, and then dons a shiny dress and tells his wife and his sister-in-law, in a high-pitched voice, hes a little mermaid.
  Negative
None of this has anything to do with the rest of the movie.
  Negative
It just  happens.
  Neutral
Things are going sour in a major way for Gina and James, but they nevertheless go forward with moving into a new house.
  Positive
After the move, James returns to their apartment to scoop up a few last items.
  Positive
This is when he conveniently finds the one thing  THE ONE THING  that Gina must keep hidden from James at this point in the story.
  Negative
Come on Gina!
  Neutral
Youre not even trying.
  Neutral
Gina gives guitar lessons to Lucy Kaitlin Orem, a little girl who lives next door.
  Negative
Come the night of the big school pageant, Gina and Lucy start off by performing a duet  but then the camera zooms in on a close-up of Gina, who takes sole control of the vocals and sings a LONG passage thats really about her and James.
  Negative
Unfortunately, we never pull back to see Lucy, who surely must be looking at Gina and thinking, Hey, whos the middle schooler here?
  Negative
If youve think Ive given away too much, trust me  theres so much more less?
  Negative
to All I See Is You than these random tidbits.
  Positive
Directed and co-written by the often-great Marc Forster Monsters Ball, Stranger Than Fiction, World War Z, this is a visually arresting film with two attractive and charismatic lead actors, but its doomed by the melodramatic twists and turns, and the ridiculous behavior by nearly every major character.
  Negative
Except the dogs and the fish.
  Neutral
The dogs and the fish are all right.
  Positive
Blakes Gina has been blind since she was a little girl.
  Negative
Shes married to Clarkes James, a big-time insurance exec.
  Negative
They live in Bangkok because that's where James office is located, and also because its a huge and bustling and colorful metropolis, and thus a great setting for a movie about a blind woman who regains her sight.
  Positive
Yep.
  Neutral
Thats the deal.
  Neutral
Gina gets a corneal transplant that restores her sight.
  Negative
Theres no explanation given for why Gina had to wait more than  years for the operation.
  Negative
Or how Gina and James met.
  Neutral
Or why she fell in love with this humorless, controlling, demanding boor, who comes home stinking drunk many nights.
  Neutral
After Gina marvels at the colors of flowers and the sky and takes in James face he looks different than she imagined, she seems most interested in visual stimuli of the sexual variety.
  Positive
She throws away her frumpy clothes, dyes her hair blonde, cakes on the makeup, flirts with a hunky guy from the local swimming pool and delights in watching other couples make love  first in a random moment, and then when she eagerly attends a live sex show while hubby James stews in the alley outside.
  Negative
James doesnt much care for the new Gina.
  Positive
He believes they were much happier when Gina was blind.
  Neutral
Hmmm, perhaps theres a way to return to those wonderful days.
  Positive
What a guy.
  Neutral
All I See Is You assaults the senses with visual tricks designed to give us Ginas viewpoint, whether shes blind or she can see or her vision is somewhere in between.
  Neutral
The score hammers home her state of mind, from confused to frightened to joyous to confused again.
  Negative
But even when Ginas vision is as clear as its ever going to be, apparently she cant see shes trapped in an absolutely ludicrous universe.
  Negative
