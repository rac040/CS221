Rock Band  has a unique focus for a franchise that's been running this long: It's less of a sequel, and more of a migration.
  Negative
Through license negotiations, backward compatibility tweaks and a handful of smart feature cuts, Rock Band  has made it so you don't have to "start over" on your current-gen console, a possibility that probably would have sunk the series.
  Negative
That mission statement might not seem especially ambitious, but to pull that off, to actually bring eight years' worth of Rock Band across console generations  that's a pretty remarkable feat.
  Positive
Rock Band 's transition isn't exactly seamless either.
  Negative
Harmonix hasn't stuck the landing with regards to some technical aspects, and some of the feature cuts feel random and meaningless.
  Negative
The result is something that lacks the kitchen sink approach of its predecessor, but there's something refreshing about its preservationist tendencies.
  Positive
Harmonix has talked about bringing Rock Band  back to the series' roots, dropping some of the less-used, more extemporaneous parts of 's Rock Band .
  Negative
In reality, the game isn't much of a tonal shift for the franchise; it just puts more of a focus on making the experience of playing Rock Band with a roomful of people as friction-free a process as is possible.
  Negative
Bands are back to basics: just a drummer, a guitarist, a bassist and one to three vocalists.
  Negative
Pro Guitars are gone, but the bigger absence is the lack of keyboard support, an instrument introduced in Rock Band .
  Negative
It also introduced a fracture to that game's setlist, as most legacy songs didn't include piano parts.
  Negative
Without keyboards, there's a much lower possibility of one player feeling left out on certain songs.
  Negative
There may be fewer instruments to play in Rock Band , but there are more ways to use them, thanks to the game's focus on freestyle play.
  Positive
Guitars got the best treatment.
  Positive
Loads of songs, including existing DLC tracks, allow guitarists to make up their own solos by noodling across the high and low frets on the guitar controller.
  Positive
Freestyle vocals let capable singers improvise if they want to mix it up, so long as they stay on key.
  Negative
In practice, the sense of creation is invigorating.
  Positive
There's a solid set of  on-disc songs to perform, with the tracklist skewing more toward modern hits than well-trod classics.
  Positive
It's a fun but thin collection  "Uptown Funk" is always a good time, and St. Vincent's "Birth in Reverse" absolutely kills.
  Positive
Most of your old DLC works in Rock Band , though getting your songs back is an imperfect process.
  Neutral
There's no automatic importing of all the songs you purchased from previous Rock Band releases; you either have to go through the in-game music store or the marketplace of your respective platform, and hunt down the songs you've bought in years past.
  Very negative
Mercifully, this is a one-time process, although a few song packs and other errant tracks haven't made the jump yet, for any number of reasons.
  Negative
There's also no timetable on when you'll be able to import disc-based tracks from old Rock Band games.
  Negative
Still, there's a weird sense of security I get from knowing most of my chickens have come home to roost.
  Negative
With the promise from Harmonix that the game is a platform that will continue to evolve over the years, Rock Band  makes me earnestly excited to play plastic instruments in a way that a more traditional sequel probably wouldn't.
  Negative
The quality of those new instruments is inconsistent; the new guitar feels a bit light and cheap, and I still prefer the click strum of a Guitar Hero axe, but the frets are snappy and accurate, making quick hammer-ons and pull-offs a breeze.
  Negative
As someone who's wrecked two Rock Band drum kits, the new drums actually feel sturdier, with thicker rubber heads on each pad that make the set a bit quieter, too.
  Negative
That said, the kick pedal is less flimsy, but takes more effort to depress, making bass drum prompts hard to hit in quick succession.
  Negative
The biggest frustration I had with Rock Band 's new instruments only occurred with the PlayStation  version of the game.
  Negative
Those controllers sync over Bluetooth, which disconnected on my band a couple of times during our first night with the game, forcing us to manually rediscover the lost controller through the PS settings menu.
  Negative
The PS architecture doesn't play especially well with Rock Band; each controller must be assigned to a user profile on the system level  even the microphone, which the game won't recognize if it's not assigned to the singer's profile.
  Negative
Manufacturer MadCatz has been pushing firmware updates out to the instruments since launch, attempting to improve things like kick pedal accuracy, but getting them onto your instruments is a Byzantine process requiring a Windows PC with Bluetooth functionality.
  Very negative
Fortunately, you can skip buying the new instruments and their respective woes if you've still got your older controllers.
  Neutral
I tested a variety of wireless last-gen instruments  Guitar Hero  axes, Rock Band  drums, you name it  on the PS version of Rock Band  using the corresponding USB dongles.
  Negative
Using Xbox  instruments with the Xbox One version requires an adapter which is sold separately for  and in a bundle with the game for , but the wireless Rock Band  and Guitar Hero controllers I tested on Xbox One worked like a charm.
  Negative
this compatibility chart before making any purchasing decisions.
  Negative
Preparing to play Rock Band  can be a bigger hassle than playing it, but the game itself is smartly streamlined, with an appropriate game mode for each situation: one for short sessions, one for parties and, of course, the quintessential career mode.
  Positive
The career mode allows you to decide the fate of your band by choosing different steps on your tour to stardom.
  Neutral
It's not exactly a robust RPG experience, but I liked how it challenges you to decide what's most important to your band.
  Positive
Are you in it for the money, or the fans?
  Neutral
The glamour, or the art?
  Neutral
Each decision tailors your rewards, your setlists and the often humorous flavor text that pops up before each show.
  Positive
There are some interesting implications to the Choose Your Own Adventure structure of Rock Band 's career mode, but I didn't feel as much ownership over my band as I did in Rock Band .
  Negative
You're not treated to a cutscene every time your band moves up a tier of fame in the rock world.
  Negative
You can't make custom logos that get plastered on T-shirts, drum heads and buses.
  Negative
You can't assign your custom characters as backup members of the band.
  Negative
These may be small touches, but they'd go a long way to making me care more about my rise to rock stardom.
  Negative
Rock Band 's Party mode allows you to seamlessly move between songs using a new voting mechanic, avoiding the delay of returning to and scrolling through your music library.
  Negative
Each player chooses from a list of four or five options after completing a song, and the game picks the winner at random.
  Positive
Sometimes it doesn't explicitly show you the songs you're voting on, forcing you to choose between, say, an "'s power ballad," a " country single" and an "alt-rock song from ."
  Negative
It's fun, though the final decisions usually left my band's singer heartbroken.
  Neutral
But that democratic song-choosing feature apparently came at the expense of custom setlists, which were way better suited for when you actually knew the songs you wanted to play going into a session.
  Negative
It's one of a few cut features that don't seem like they were removed in the interest of streamlining; features like a song-by-song practice mode and online multiplayer are also regrettably absent.
