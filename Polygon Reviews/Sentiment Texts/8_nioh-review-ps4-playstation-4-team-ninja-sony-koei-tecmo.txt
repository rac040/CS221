Nioh is a different kind of game for Team Ninja.
  Positive
The Japanese developer has been publisher Koei Tecmos flagship workhorse in the past, but times have been tough for the Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive creators for years.
  Negative
Ninja Gaiden has seen underwhelming installment after underwhelming installment, and Dead or Alive has similarly fallen from relevance in the fighting game scene.
  Negative
Now, Team Ninja hopes to reboot somewhat with a game that capitalizes on the success of fellow Japanese studio FromSoftwares Souls games  all while remaining true to its roots in mechanically sophisticated action games.
  Positive
The result is Nioh, a game that straddles a number of genres and ideas, and which often feels simultaneously derivative and new.
  Negative
The question then, is whether its successful or not, and whether fans of its very different influences can expect to find something to like.
  Negative
With that in mind, this review is a little different, taking the form of a conversation between Polygon editors Arthur Gies, who loves and misses the glory days of Ninja Gaiden, and Phil Kollar, who could charitably be called obsessed with FromSoftwares Souls games.
  Negative
So, in our unofficial style guide for Polygon reviews, one of the more explicit rules we have is to avoid comparing one game to another as a shortcut for description.
  Negative
But with Nioh it feels unavoidable to do that.
  Negative
In fact its one of the main reasons the two of us are reviewing this game in the first place.
  Positive
Niohs developer, Team Ninja, has itself been explicit in the games its trying to emulate or draw inspiration from here.
  Negative
Specifically, Team Ninja set out to make a game that brings together the teams hardcore action game roots from the Ninja Gaiden series and the increasingly popular, extremely difficult Souls series made by FromSoftware.
  Negative
I love the latter and you love the former, so we decided it made sense to split duties on this review.
  Positive
Theres no doubt that Nioh draws from both of these sources, but the more I played, the more its set apart  for better and worse  by its differences.
  Negative
Did you find much of Ninja Gaiden in Nioh, and if so, did it improve or hinder the experience for you?
  Negative
Arthur: Its funny, because Nioh looks like a Ninja Gaiden game.
  Positive
Its not like a lot of the, well, well call them Souls-alikes out there that ape the aesthetics and basic weirdness of Froms modern era.
  Negative
Its a very shiny, colorful game that also feels unabashedly Japanese in its aesthetics and visual inspirations.
  Positive
That combined with the way William or Anjin, I guess, if you want runs holding a sword did remind me of Ninja Gaiden.
  Negative
But then I got into the first fight of the game and was quickly disabused of that notion.
  Negative
The Ninja Gaiden games are defined by extremely fast, violent combat.
  Negative
Its more about control and a constant assault, and you can be positively unrelenting all the time.
  Negative
If you find yourself having trouble with a certain level or boss encounter in Nioh, you may be able to find relief thanks to the games open-ended approach to co-op.
  Positive
You can summon another player into your game at any shrine by offering up a specific item which youll collect plenty of throughout the game.
  Negative
If youre more the helping type, you can jump into a co-op session from the mission select map, and it will pull you into any level youve previously completed.
  Negative
Teaming up trivializes a lot of the games difficulty  many of the bosses become pushovers when a second player is around to distract them  but its nice to have that option to just blow off steam slicing down bad guys with a buddy.
  Negative
Nioh is ... not that.
  Neutral
I do think the control responsiveness and the way you move, the way the game animates, is much more in line with character action games like Ninja Gaiden and Bayonetta than the Souls games.
  Positive
You can do things quickly.
  Neutral
You just cant do much of anything before you need to regroup your ki.
  Negative
Phil: Learning how to perfectly time the "ki pulse," as its called, is one of Niohs greatest and most satisfying challenges.
  Very positive
It adds a certain rhythm to combat, and it provided a perfect measuring stick for my improvement as I progressed through the game.
  Positive
Arthur: Theres a level of mechanical sophistication present in Nioh that certainly eclipses what Ive seen in my time with Dark Souls and Bloodborne.
  Negative
The ki pulse is part of that for sure  theres often a riskreward decision to be made in using it because it causes a split-second pause that can be the difference between avoiding an attack from an enemy that could nearly split you in half in one swing or being sent back to the nearest shrine without your Amrita the level-up currency in Nioh.
  Negative
Its an interesting elaboration on combat decision making that comes straight out of Gears of War of all places.
  Positive
But in addition to ki management and the pulse system, youve also got a number of different weapon types and stances that dramatically change the way William fights and defends.
  Negative
Near the beginning of the game I couldnt be bothered to switch, but a few hours in I was snapping back and forth in a way that felt both very responsive and very satisfying.
  Positive
Nioh allows a lot of space for sophisticated play, which is good, because if our experience is any indication, youre going to play through the same parts of the game over and over and over.
  Positive
And not just because Nioh will kill you all the time.
  Negative
Though it definitely does that.
  Positive
I mentioned it in a post last week, but yes, Nioh is very difficult.
  Negative
Its certainly mechanically demanding, and that can be its own struggle.
  Positive
But beyond that theres a more frustrating element to Niohs level of difficulty, which is in how it blends its action elements and its RPG element.
  Negative
Niohs depth extends beyond the moment-to-moment combat and into the systems themselves.
  Negative
Beyond just leveling up and increasing your stats, there is ... an overwhelming amount of stuff to customize.
  Negative
You can craft your own weapons.
  Positive
You can meld pieces of armor into other pieces of armor.
  Negative
You can reroll the stats on individual items in an attempt to get something more suited to your current situation.
  Negative
You can choose between dozens of different "guardian spirits" that offer their own bonuses to navigate.
  Neutral
Its a lot to take in, and on a few occasions during my playthrough it really dragged down the experience.
  Negative
Im thinking of one scenario in particular: I got completely stuck on a boss.
  Negative
He was a simple, sword-wielding enemy, but he was extremely fast, and no matter what stance I switched to or what weapon I wielded, I just could not take him down.
  Negative
Eventually, in frustration, I left the level and decided to use "soul forging" to rebuild my weapon with different attributes.
  Negative
When I was satisfied, I made my way back to the boss and downed him in one try.
  Negative
This incredible range of options is awesome, but Nioh lacks a way to really get across whether deaths are due to your own lack of skills or some behind-the-scenes numbers that you just havent juggled properly.
  Negative
Arthur: Which is a problem, because I actually quite like how Nioh handles ... Im sure they want to call it loot  comparisons have been made to Diablo, which is the other reason why both you and I wanted to review this game in tandem, as thats where our Venn diagram overlaps here  but I guess I would call it gear.
  Very negative
Early on in Nioh I switched up weapons as I found them, and you find a lot of stuff all the time.
  Negative
But once I got access to the blacksmith and started playing around with soul-matching and reforging, I realized that once I found weapons I really liked, I could stick with them.
  Negative
It took a really long time to understand that.
  Neutral
That said, it does make certain item and gear decisions perpetually useful, and the familiarity system, which makes weapons more powerful as you use them more, gives good reasons to spend more time with weapons and develop a real attachment to them.
  Positive
This did have the side effect of narrowing my focus on the kinds of weapons I used though  which in some cases made me specialize in places I found less rewarding and fun to use but undeniably useful.
  Negative
Namely, spears.
  Negative
Phil: Yeah, this certainly isnt the type of game where you can pick one weapon type and stick with it indefinitely.
  Negative
My weapon choice was axes  big, hefty and damaging, but slow as hell.
  Negative
Since a lot of enemies are very fast, it was in my best interest to always have a sword or kusarigama available to swap to.
  Positive
And as with stances, you can switch between two weapons on the fly, which really opens up options in combat and feels great.
  Negative
Arthur: I think the versatility available is great, but theres a pretty pronounced learning curve that, even after  or  hours, I struggled with occasionally.
  Neutral
To swap between weapons, you hold down R and hit left or right on the d-pad.
  Negative
To swap between ranged weapons, you hold down the R and hit up or down.
  Negative
To switch between two sets of active items used by hitting the appropriate directions on the d-pad you hit R. And ki pulses are done using R again.
  Negative
Then there are stances and blocking and strong and heavy attacks.
  Neutral
Its a lot of stuff.
  Positive
And sometimes it feels like the versatility and options are obstructed by how convoluted it can be to utilize them.
  Negative
For PS Pro owners, Nioh offers several options depending on your priorities regarding framerate or resolution.
  Negative
Regardless of which PS you have, Nioh gives several presentation options.
  Negative
Movie mode locks the games framerate at , and varies the resolution from there.
  Neutral
If you absolutely must have the highest resolution image possible on your likely expensive, new-ish television, Movie mode targets a full K resolution on the Pro, and a more conservative p on default PS hardware.
  Negative
Meanwhile, Action mode locks the game at FPS, and varies the resolution.
  Negative
On PS Pro, this usually hovers around p, though it can drop considerably lower on the base PS.
  Negative
Finally, Variable Movie mode allows the framerate to fluctuate while attempting to maintain higher resolutions on whichever PS model you're playing on.
  Negative
For what it's worth, the game looks great in action mode on a PS Pro model, and the improved framerate leads to more responsive controls.
  Positive
That's how I played the entirety of the game on my Samsung KS UHD television.
  Negative

Phil: The mechanical demands of the game are also held back at some points by its camera.
  Neutral
Controlling your view can be difficult under the best of circumstances; when youre in a crowded hallway or fighting a fast-moving boss, it be comes a real pain in the ass.
  Negative
I certainly adjusted as I spent dozens of hours playing Nioh, but the camera never felt as it good as it should be given how much the game asks of you.
  Negative
Arthur: Also, I would just like to aim a disapproving, uncomfortable glare at the person who made clicking on the right stick the button to lock onto enemies  something that needs to happen quickly and cleanly  and also the button that snaps you  degrees in the other direction.
  Negative
Away from the thing that you might in point of fact be trying to snap onto before it murders you in one or two hits.
  Negative
Phil: One element of Nioh we havent discussed that Im curious to get your thoughts on is its level design.
  Negative
The Souls games became beloved in part for having huge open worlds that were a lot of fun to explore.
  Positive
Nioh is mission-based, its levels closed off, though still large and somewhat complex.
  Negative
Did you enjoy navigating these spaces?
  Neutral
Arthur: I think aside from the mechanical differences in the way Nioh handles compared to Froms games, Niohs structure is one of the major differentiating factors, and not always for the better.
  Negative
Niohs levels can each take a really long time to beat  death comes swiftly, especially with bosses, which Im sure we both have opinions on  but those levels are actually pretty small, in general.
  Positive
This leads to spaces that are replayable and give room to experiment with Niohs combat mechanics, but the sense of hard fought discovery that the Souls games are so rife with just isnt here.
  Negative
And I think that undermines the sense of accomplishment I felt in Nioh when I spent literally four hours trying to kill the same boss.
  Negative
When I finally beat it, I held circle over a shiny spot in the level and went back to the level select screen.
  Positive
More than a little anticlimactic.
  Negative
Phil: Bosses can definitely be an issue in Nioh.
  Neutral
Of the games couple dozen or so boss fights, most of them were challenging encounters that tested my abilities but made me feel pretty good upon overcoming them.
  Negative
But for a few  Im looking at you, giant octopus asshole  theyre presented more as massive slogs that you need to survive, slowly chipping away at your opponents health bar without making a single mistake.
  Negative
In these scenarios, one mistimed dodge can lose -plus minutes of progress.
  Negative
Thats not abnormal for this type of game, but when the  minutes you now need to replay is just following the same pattern over and over  dodge this attack, block this attack, slash twice, repeat  its aggravating.
  Negative
Arthur: I think my issue with some of Niohs bosses is that after a certain point, they dont feel like tests of skill, or even of memorization  though both of those things are somewhat necessary  but of mindless patience.
  Negative
The most infuriating deaths were the ones caused by my impatience to get on with my life on the fifth or sixth or seventh attempt at a boss, when they were nearly dead and I would rush an attack in hoping I could just end it.
  Negative
It was like rushing a chore and being forced to do the whole thing over again.
  Negative
In a way, Niohs bosses are one of the most Ninja Gaiden things about the game.
  Negative
Ninja Gaiden as a series always struggled with bosses that were challenging while avoiding, well, being total goddamned bullshit.
  Negative
Those games often failed at that, and I think honestly Nioh can as well.
  Negative
Bosses often dont seem to follow the same rules of combat and basic mechanical limitations like collision detection that every other enemy follows, and that was a real point of contention for me.
  Negative
I dont mind being challenged to be better at a game.
  Negative
I really like that, and its what I liked about Ninja Gaiden Black and some of Bayonetta, for example.
  Positive
But I dont think Niohs bosses hit that sweet spot very often.
  Positive
I did appreciate that I didnt have to watch their introduction cutscenes over and over again though, given how many times I had to fight them.
  Negative
Phil: The speed with which you can skip through cutscenes is a blessing, seeing as Nioh sure has a lot of them and its story is not much to write home about.
  Negative
The best thing I can say about the plot is that its inoffensive.
  Positive
William isnt a particularly likable main character, and his quest to track down and murder a man who wronged him never pulled me in Arthurs note: Hes also trying to reunite with his spirit-girlfriendweapon Saoirse, thank you very much.
  Positive
On the other hand, I was fascinated with all the other trappings surrounding the plot.
  Negative
Nioh employs Japanese mythology and history in fun ways that urged me to Wikipedia to look up what stories these characters were based on.
  Positive
And if the lackluster story didnt excite my interest, it also stayed out of the way, which is more than I can say for a lot of plot-driven games.
  Negative
Yeah, I think the plot and development for William is kind of thin, but theres a very large cast of characters, many of whom are fairly interesting and based on real people, kind of.
  Negative
And thats sort of emblematic of Nioh in general.
  Negative
Not everything it does is done well, but a lot of it works, and it does so in unconventional ways.
  Positive
Because of its complexity, because of its myriad of interlocking systems, Nioh can be hard to pin down.
  Negative
More than anything, it feels like a flawed but promising first draft.
  Negative
Team Ninja has taken some big chances here.
  Negative
They dont all pay off, but the ones that do pull together for a game that justifies some of the pain required.
  Neutral
here.
