Rise of the Tomb Raider reads like an answer to the question, "What if we made an open-world game but removed all the mundane bullshit from it?"
  Negative
's Tomb Raider reboot.
  Neutral
And yet, Rise simultaneously maintains the tight design that made its predecessor so entertaining.
  Positive
There are some rough edges to Rise of the Tomb Raider  weaknesses in its writing, goofiness in its animation and so on.
  Negative
But these never add up to much of concern in a game so certain of its goals and confident in its execution.
  Positive
Rise of the Tomb Raider begins at full speed, with protagonist Lara Croft and Jonah, one of her companions from the last game, journeying into the frigid mountains of Siberia.
  Negative
Through some flashbacks  both in cutscene and playable form  we learn that Lara is on the trail of an artifact and a lost city, two myths that her father swore were real before a tragic death.
  Negative
As the adventure progresses, Lara finds herself up against Trinity, a shadowy organization looking for the same historical discoveries for more malevolent purposes.
  Negative
If there's one spot where Rise of the Tomb Raider is noticeably worse than its predecessor, it's the overarching narrative.
  Negative
's Tomb Raider chronicled Lara's transformation from a regular young woman into a "survivor"  aka someone able and unafraid of taking down an army of paramilitary thugs.
  Negative
It was a little clich, and it required some suspension of disbelief, but it made for an appealing tale, especially when coupled with the mysteries of the island of Yamatai.
  Positive
The lost city of Kitezh brings its own points of intrigue to Rise of the Tomb Raider, but they feel like a retread; where the previous game's story kept me on my toes until the last act, I knew where Rise was headed within the first few hours.
  Negative
On top of that, Lara's motivation for the adventure can, by and large, be summed up as, "My dad was interested in this, so I am also interested in it."
  Negative
What minor growth she sees by the end of the story comes across as forced and, frankly, not terribly interesting.
  Negative
Rise of the Tomb Raider is saved by two important facts: First, the moment-to-moment dialogue is sharp, and moves quickly.
  Positive
I may not have understood why Lara was involved in this situation in the first place, but damned if I didn't grin at the way she refused to take shit from anyone once she was there.
  Negative
Trinity and its lead bad guy, Konstantin, deserve special marks as well.
  Negative
Tomb Raider 's antagonist wasn't memorable at all.
  Negative
Literally, I can't remember anything about him.
  Negative
Konstantin, on the other hand, is psychologically broken and religiously motivated in a way that stood out to me.
  Negative
There's an edge to his choices and his reason for trying to find Kitezh, with some fun twists to his backstory that you can discover along the way.
  Positive
As goofy as it is, I love the idea of an evil organization racing Lara Croft to hunt down ancient secrets.
  Positive
It's a great concept that serves the series as a whole, even beyond this single entry.
  Positive
The second grace that saves Rise of the Tomb Raider from an otherwise shallow story is that, well, it just doesn't depend on that story much.
  Negative
Aside from a couple of big plot moments, cutscenes in Rise are blessedly short, and you're generally allowed to keep moving during dialogue between characters.
  Negative
The gameplay comes first here, and it's that gameplay that makes Rise of the Tomb Raider so great.
  Positive
Rise of the Tomb Raider's foundation is the same as it was in : Lara crawls, climbs, shoots and swings her way through a series of outrageous environments, from a ship frozen vertically into the side of a glacier to an abandoned gulag repurposed by Trinity.
  Very negative
The combat still emphasizes careful aim and smart use of resources in the environment.
  Positive
The platforming is still damn near perfect, giving the player control above all else, even when it leads to some hilariously awkward animations.
  Negative
None of this has changed, and none of it really needed to.
  Negative
What has changed is the environments these things take place in.
  Neutral
's Tomb Raider got a lot of mileage out of a single island, but Rise finds even more variety in the nooks and crannies of Siberia.
  Negative
And since Lara isn't stranded this time around, there's even the opportunity for a brief but fun trip to another region.
  Positive
It's not just that Rise of the Tomb Raider has a greater variety of environments, but those environments offer more things to do.
  Neutral
There are narrative collectibles  diary entries and artifacts that piece together the history of the region  plus hidden environmental challenges, boxes containing pieces to put together new weapons and coin caches that allow you to purchase other upgrades.
  Negative
There's even a full side quest system, with NPCs who give you tasks to complete in the surrounding area with rewards for pulling through.
  Positive
There's much to do in Rise of the Tomb Raider's expansive hub areas, but they're also small enough that I never got exhausted journeying across the map to hit a new objective.
  Negative
The optional content never felt like more of a burden than a boon.
  Negative
I finished the game with over  percent completion despite playing at a pretty fast clip for review, and I have every intention of going back to mop up that last  percent.
  Negative
While Rise of the Tomb Raider has dropped the long-forgotten multiplayer mode that was included in the last game, it's found a much more welcome source of replay value in expedition mode.
  Neutral
This new single-player option allows you to replay chapters, jump into hub areas with new objectives or just go for a classic score chase.
  Positive
Each of these challenges can be modified in interesting ways.
  Positive
As you progress through the story, you'll earn points that can be spent to purchase card packs.
  Negative
Cards can have gear or upgrades for Lara, or they can have other modifiers  tweaks that make enemies harder to take down or turn Lara into an unstoppable killing machine.
  Negative
Each modifier can have a major impact on how any one run through expedition mode plays out, and Square Enix has promised to continue introducing new cards through the game's DLC season pass.
  Negative
Notably, packs of cards can also be purchased with real money.
  Negative
However, just playing expedition mode earns more points with which you can purchase more packs, so it doesn't seem like people will be forced to spend real money at any point.
  Neutral
The best parts of Rise of the Tomb Raider's optional content are the tombs themselves.
  Positive
Some fans were bothered by how the  reboot featured very few tombs, temples and other similar archaeological discoveries, and how it forced them into side areas.
  Negative
That latter issue hasn't changed, but there must be over a dozen of these optional tombs now.
  Negative
They're some of the best-looking areas in a beautiful game, and the puzzles they task you with solving are wonderfully designed.
  Very positive
I was often left scratching my head for an hour or longer before reaching a solution, but that time never felt wasted.
  Very negative
On top of increasing the size of the areas, Rise of the Tomb Raider has also greatly expanded the crafting system from the previous game.
  Positive
Lara can now craft a number of different types of ammunition on the fly, while choosing from bigger upgrades to her arsenal of weapons at base camps.
  Positive
The resource system feels a little loosely implemented  I found myself inexplicably "full" on resources for most of the game, despite feeling like I was crafting at every opportunity  but it provides another layer of motivation for carefully exploring environments rather than just rushing headfirst into the next story beat.
  Negative
In many ways, Rise of the Tomb Raider could be viewed as a fairly modest sequel.
  Positive
It successfully builds off Crystal Dynamics' excellent reboot, but it doesn't introduce any massive changes; the scope is greater but still in spitting distance of the previous game.
  Positive
But successfully regaining the feeling created in an extremely good game is no small feat.
  Positive
This is the inauguration of Tomb Raider as a formula once more, but for now, it's a formula I'm happy revisiting.
  Positive
here.
  Neutral
