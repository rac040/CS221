The first major, stand-alone Battlefield release in years to be developed outside of series originator DICE, Hardline is Dead Space developer Visceral Games first crack at a full Battlefield game.
  Negative
Previously, Visceral has contributed work on multiplayer maps for Battlefield  and , and also provided help with Battlefield 's campaign.
  Negative
Hardline is also taking the series to untested waters: a non-military setting.
  Negative
But Hardline's biggest departure is something else entirely.
  Neutral
Battlefield has always lived and died by its multiplayer  in part because its campaigns have always severely underwhelmed 's Bad Company  notwithstanding.
  Negative
Battlefield Hardline's cops and robbers multiplayer is competent without breaking new ground.
  Neutral
But for the first time in years, that doesn't feel like the game's main focus.
  Negative
Battlefield Hardline's biggest push lay in its campaign, which places you in the role of Miami vice detective Nick Mendoza as he tries to uncover the forces behind a brand new turf war between drug gangs in the city.
  Negative
This is just how the story begins however, as a multiple-year storyline told over  episodes goes from Miami to L.A., then Nevada and back again.
  Negative
The basic foundation of Battlefield Hardline isn't new.
  Negative
It's a first-person shooter whose gunplay emphasizes positioning, bullet physics and a decent amount of environmental destruction.
  Negative
But for whatever reason  and there are several good justifications here  Visceral has worked to add stealth mechanics to the Battlefield formula.
  Negative
This isn't a passive suggestion, either.
  Negative
Enemies have vision cones clearly indicated on the minimap, and a meter shows when you're in view and in danger of being spotted.
  Positive
But the biggest departure in Hardline from previous precedent is the addition of non-lethal takedowns.
  Negative
While this can be weapon-based courtesy of melee attacks from behind or an optional taser, Hardline also offers an arrest mechanic.
  Negative
If you can sneak up on enemies, you can flash your badge, and they'll drop their weapons and put their hands up.
  Negative
This provides a limited window of time to handcuff and permanently disable them.
  Negative
There's some measure of sophistication here.
  Positive
If you attempt to arrest more than one suspect at once, you'll need to cover everyone with your gun while acting, or risk someone getting ideas about resisting, and if another enemy stumbles on your arrest in progress, the jig is up and the firefight is certain to start.
  Negative
There are also special targets with arrest warrants out that will provide additional "expert points," which in turn unlock new gear to use in the campaign.
  Negative
The arrest system offers a skeleton of new tactical depth to the series, and I appreciated the option to subdue rather than shoot.
  Negative
Navigating some spaces had a real sense of thoughtful, first-person stealth, and added some much-needed thought and strategy.
  Positive
I felt like I was casing targets, looking for the smartest way in, and more importantly, that "smartest way" didn't feel static.
  Negative
There are frequently multiple ways to get to objectives with their own pros and cons, and Hardline provides opportunities to use the grappling hooks and ziplines it introduces beyond the boring "press X to do thing" structure of so many other shooters.
  Negative
Combined with the light investigation elements  which takes the genre-standard in-mission collectibles and makes them part of a bigger narrative of investigations tied to unlocks  Hardline's experiments give it a sense of identity that Battlefield has missed since Bad Company  in .
  Negative
Well, sometimes, at least.
  Neutral
But that identity can feel a little fleeting.
  Negative
Battlefield Hardline works unbelievably hard to avoid discussions of police violence, the militarization of domestic police forces and any meaningful commentary on its subject matter.
  Negative
In part, this is because Hardline is almost comically cynical  every cop is dirty, whether by choice or necessity, there are no "good guys," everything is shades of grey, etc.
  Negative
Visceral makes some smart moves, though.
  Positive
Each in-game chapter is presented as an episode as if it were a TV series, right down to the "previously on" bumps that appear when you go back into the game after quitting, re-acquainting you with relevant plot points and such.
  Negative
This also gives good entry and exit points for each mission.
  Positive
Hardline has a smoother narrative arc than just about any recent in-medias res shooter I can think of, because the episodic structure lets time pass.
  Negative
There's also some reasonably likable characters who are admittedly not great people and dialogue that's only occasionally terrible and generally pretty ok.
  Positive
Hardline's biggest narrative issues are a wild variation in tone from moment to moment, hyper-serious one scene and Bay-sian action movie the next.
  Positive
This isn't surprising, because Hardline is a video game, and I suppose there are expectations along with that about spectacle.
  Negative
But I was a little disappointed when Hardline leaned more heavily into action movie cliches over detectivepost-noir TV conventions.
  Negative
And I'm not just talking about the explosions, or the tank  yes, there's a tank at one point, because this is a Battlefield game, after all.
  Negative
I'm also talking about the overall body count, which i'm pretty sure numbered in the hundreds by the time I was done, even as I endeavored to shoot as few people as possible while finishing the game for review.
  Negative
The thing is, Hardline's non-combat mechanics feel glued on to the underlying game with varying degrees of cohesion.
  Negative
Visceral has said the game can be played without resorting to gunplay for the most part, but it doesn't feel designed to accommodate that very often.
  Negative
If you want to play without shooting, you're going to go through trial and error that goes above and beyond the usual stealth title checkpoint grind.
  Negative
There are other polish issues that pop up while going the less-lethal route  for example, the handcuffing animation that accompanies arrests frequently clips through the game world, leaving enemies half-inside level geometry, or in the ground itself.
  Negative
Also, later, when you should not be able to arrest people, you still can, a fact the game pretty conveniently doesn't address in any way.
  Negative
And, well, you actually can't finish Hardline without killing.
  Negative
There are several moments where shooting is literally the only option, not just the most likely one.
  Negative
These things work to undermine the grounded storytelling that Hardline seems to want when it isn't busy unlocking new weapons for you.
  Negative
All that grounding is cast aside in Hardline's multiplayer, which takes most of the procedural elements the campaign adds and strips them out for a more conventional Battlefield experience.
  Negative
That isn't to say it's all gone  you can still subdue an opponent, which will feed you intel on their nearby teammates, and the heist elements present in parts of the campaign are a staple of the multiplayer's new modes.
  Negative
Hardline also eschews more dramatic military hardware in favor a more civilian-tinged garage, though there are still heavily armored options and helicopters around.
  Negative
However,while the last three Battlefield releases have brought major improvements and expansions to the basic formula of the series  destructibility and squads in Bad Company , huge levels and player counts in Battlefield , and a combination of both along with level-based transformation courtesy of "levolution" in Battlefield   Hardline takes an iterative approach to Battlefield's class-based multiplayer setup, one that leans more heavily on tone and subject matter related to its urban basis.
  Neutral
There are some smaller tweaks: Weapons and equipment are unlocked using in-game cash earned through play, rather than by leveling up other weapons.
  Negative
Levels are also smaller, with more room-to-room combat spaces contained within bigger environments.
  Negative
This leads to some cooler, more "intimate" moments as walls are torn apart by gunfire, though the sprawling, expansive scope of the last couple of Battlefield games has been dialed back considerably.
  Negative
Visceral's biggest swing at leaving their own mark on Battlefield comes from a host of new modes oriented around their cops-and-robbers dynamic.
  Negative
Some are familiar iterations of old favorites: Heist mode plays similarly to Rush, added in Bad Company .
  Negative
In Heist, police players are tasked with defending a vault, while criminals must break in and then escape with the loot contained therein.
  Negative
Hotwire borrows from the series-defining Conquest mode, save that instead of capturing and holding points on the map, players must seize marked vehicles and drive them at a minimum speed to hold them.
  Negative
Blood Money features a central money pile that both teams must use to fill their own banks in order to win, and there are hostage and VIP modes as well.
  Negative
While some of these are new to Battlefield, there's a sense of familiarity there for anyone who played Counterstrike or, more recently, Overkill's Payday and Payday .
  Negative
Underneath Visceral's interpretations of this kind of game design is the same excellent mechanical foundation that's driven Battlefield for years, one I prefer to many of the series' closest competitors.
  Positive
And gadgets borrowed from the campaign like the zipline and grappling hook add some new strategic options to the mix.
  Negative
But the sense of newness and invention that the series has seen in all its proper releases isn't here, and the nature of Battlefield often seems at odds with the new modes.
  Negative
Snipers still seem too versatile thanks to Battlefield's very powerful pistol complement, and I'm pretty sure I've already caught players abusing glitches to shoot through walls in the wild.
  Negative
In fact, the carnage and destruction demanded by a Battlefield game seems to hold Hardline back from being something truly different, something that explores the ideas that Visceral toys with.
  Negative
As it is now, Hardline feels somewhat torn between its new ideas and its old obligations.
  Negative
And, in possibly the most esoteric, me-specific observation I might make about Hardline, the setting feels weird.
  Negative
Every military shooter has some amount of cognitive dissonance, but Hardline in particular feels literally close to home.
  Negative
Where the campaign avoids any social questions whatsoever with its "all cops are crooked" themes, the multiplayer basks in military weapons in civilian settings.
  Negative
It's weird watching cops run around with grenade launchers, and it's disconcerting watching gunfights unfold "gloriously" in city streets, especially when they look like streets I've walked, near places I've been.
  Very negative
In areas where Battlefield has always excelled and pushed forward, Hardline presents experiments, rather than refinements or fixes.
  Negative
The result is multiplayer that feels very familiar, very quickly.
  Negative
But its campaign, while feeling not completely sure about what it wants to be, is more interesting and certainly all-around better than the last few years' worth of Battlefield games.
  Positive
The result is something that's both less and more than its predecessors.
  Positive
At this time, I've spent approximately  hours playing Battlefield Hardline, including approximately  hours on live servers on Xbox One.
  Negative
However, given Battlefield's previous difficulties at launch and after, we will be monitoring the game over the coming weeks to see how it performs before removing our provisional tag.
  Neutral
here.
  Neutral
Ed's note: After several weeks of reliable service for Battlefield Hardline, we're now comfortable removing the provisional status from our review.
  Positive
