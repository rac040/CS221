From Where in the World is Carmen San Diego?
  Neutral
to Oregon Trail, the power of games as teaching tools has been demonstrated countless times through the years.
  Negative
But puzzlingly, edutainment has remain mainly the purview of games aimed at kids.
  Negative
Never Alone isnt a textbook-style interactive CD-ROM, but it enrobes a fascinating cultural survey with a candy coating of game mechanics.
  Positive
The story and heritage developer Upper One Games and publisher E-Line Media is distinct, and its presentation is made with care.
  Negative
But the platformer built to help make this education easier to swallow is a little bitter.
  Negative
On its surface, Never Alone is a serene, beautifully-rendered platformer in the spirit of Limbo or Braid.
  Negative
When her village is plagued by blizzards, a young Iupiat girl named Nuna sets out  with the aid of a helpful white fox  to find their source and, hopefully, put a stop to them.
  Negative
In many games, Nunas cultural heritage would be a helpful way of rounding out her character, but Never Alone injects that cultural identity in every crevice of the world she inhabits and the story in which she plays the starring role.
  Negative
As you navigate the perils of Nunas vast, frozen world, youll unlock brief, expertly-produced videos that explain a facet of her people, an Alaska Native group called the Iupiat.
  Negative
These  mini-documentaries explore everything from the value of caribou skin clothing to the importance of sharing to the Iupiats survival, and, better yet, theyre related by actual members of the community.
  Positive
While most games would exile these explainers to a sub-menu, Never Alone puts them front and center, frequently prompting the player to watch the clips as theyre unlocked and always tying them to the action of the game.
  Negative
For example, when a mysterious owl-man asks Nuna to help locate his drum, a video is unlocked which explores the importance of percussive instruments to the Alaska Native culture.
  Negative
Its not surprising that these clips are presented as keystones rather than diversions; Never Alone was developed by Upper One Games, which identifies itself as "the first indigenous-owned video game developer and publisher in US history."
  Negative
So yes, theres an agenda here, but its a noble one and it adds an immeasurable amount to the product as a whole.
  Positive
Im a sucker for cultural documentaries, and the clips permeating Never Alone add up to a really fascinating one.
  Negative
Its a shame then that the game that surrounds them is so underwhelming.
  Negative
Never Alone isnt egregiously bad, its just wholly uninspired.
  Very negative
Nuna can jump, toss a traditional weapon called a bola and drag the occasional box.
  Negative
Her fox buddy can scale walls and summon ancient spirits that serve as platforms for Nuna to navigate the world.
  Negative
Good games have been made from more mundane mechanics, but Never Alone rarely forces the player to think about how they need to be employed.
  Negative
You see ice, you throw the bola at it.
  Negative
You see a coiled rope, the fox needs to unfurl it for Nuna.
  Negative
Its all completely rote and thuddingly mechanical.
  Negative
The game doesnt even require much platforming precision until its later stages.
  Negative
Never Alone is designed as a co-op experience, and though it can be played by a single player switching between the two leads, I would strongly advise against it.
  Very negative
The AI pathing is absolutely terrible and I cant tell you the number of times I completed a series of jumps only to watch in horror as my computer controlled pal leapt to their doom.
  Very negative
Having a partner doesnt make Never Alone more engaging or inventive, so the core issues remain, but at least theyll keep you from wanting to pull your hair out.
  Positive
Solo play pushes Never Alone from inoffensive to infuriating and frankly should have been omitted entirely.
  Negative
The game component of Never Alone does have some strengths.
  Neutral
It looks great, with some lovely animation and stark environments.
  Very positive
It sounds great, thanks to a sparse score and a mesmerizingly gruff narrator recounting Nunas story in the Iupiat tongue.
  Positive
Its tempting to wish you could divorce Never Alones entrancing, beautiful, heartfelt videos from its mediocre game, but youd be doing them both a disservice.
  Negative
Hearing about a culture is one thing, but the ability to then walk around in that culture, to face enemies and traverse environments informed by that cultures struggles really helps the information stick.
  Negative
Despite Never Alones failings, its an effective, important experiment in blending gaming and education for grown-ups and, as such, I find it hard to entirely dismiss.
  Negative
While Im in no great rush to play it again, the appreciation I gleaned for a culture I knew practically nothing about is something I really cherish.
  Negative
If you can patiently plod your way through the game entwined with the story of the Iupiat people, I suspect youll cherish them too.
  Negative
