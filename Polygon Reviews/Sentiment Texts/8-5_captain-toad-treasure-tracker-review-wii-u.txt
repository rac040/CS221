Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker is best explained using the word "Nintendo" as a verb.
  Positive
Rooted in a side mission found in another game, it seems at first blush like a weird, downloadable lark.
  Negative
To be fair, it might be just that for another developer, on another platform.
  Negative
Quirky experiments don't belong in retail games, and that's exactly what Captain Toad is  a series of shovel hits at a very specific quarry, in all sorts of directions.
  Negative
Or rather, it's a very pure expression of what Nintendo games are: playable elaborations on a strong, central concept.
  Neutral
Nintendo games explore their root mechanics thoroughly, finding fun through solid execution and exploration of the idea.
  Very positive
Using that as a verb, Captain Toad Nintendos.
  Negative
It Nintendos hard.
  Neutral
It doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles.
  Negative
There's no quest to save a Mushroom Kingdom, or any kingdom at all.
  Negative
But what it has is great ideas, iterated on again and again.
  Positive
And the narrowness of its focus allows it to find an awful lot of fun without that other stuff getting in its way.
  Positive
If you played last year's Super Mario D World, you already understand Captain Toad's basic premise.
  Negative
Using Captain Toad or Toadette, you explore diorama-style stages grabbing coins, crystals and, ultimately, a gold star to complete the level.
  Negative
This is all very Mario, but the difference is in the details: You can't jump, and your walk is more like a waddle, even at full speed.
  Negative
As a result, Captain Toad is less about action, and more about deliberation.
  Negative
You can't see every part of a level from one angle  how you position the camera and where you look is always important.
  Negative
Enemies and obstacles have to be considered, and a "simple" slightly raised platform might be the whole crux of a stage's challenge.
  Negative
While Captain Toad seems subdued by the measure of modern Nintendo releases like Mario and Zelda, at its core it's pure Nintendo.
  Positive
The simple concept of wandering around slowly, without vertical navigation, is iterated on again and again.
  Negative
Themed levels with their own aesthetics are introduced over time, and each establishes its own gimmick.
  Positive
The most frequently recurring gimmick is the goofy dragon "boss" stages that you'll encounter, and these work as well as anything to show the scaling challenge Captain Toad presents.
  Positive
At first, it's as simple as running from one head-height wall to the next to avoid timed breaths of fire that push toward you, but soon you'll be climbing ladders, or hitting switches to extend moving bridges, and then all three.
  Very negative
Captain Toad expertly provides you with opportunities to feel like you're learning the game, and can excel with the tools it gives you.
  Positive
It made me feel smart when I did things right.
  Positive
And over the course of more than  levels, Captain Toad finds a lot of ground to cover, a lot of ways to make players feel smart.
  Positive
I wanted to find collectibles and secrets because they were there, because I felt a sense of accomplishment in finding them, not because I had to.
  Negative
Captain Toad does this again and again, playing with its limited control scheme not by introducing new actions, but new ways to juggle the worlds you're in.
  Negative
In fact, the only time the game's sense of invention falters is when it relies too much on control gimmicks instead of level design quirks.
  Negative
I'm sure I'm a unique, cranky individual, but there wasn't a single time where blowing into the Wii U GamePad's mic felt like a good idea.
  Neutral
Camera issues in Captain Toad transcended my crankiness and felt like actual problems.
  Negative
They don't manifest often, but there are certain levels where the game's camera doesn't seem up to the task at hand, which led to a few deaths that didn't feel fair.
  Negative
Along with a few levels that revolve too heavily on twitch reflexes for a pair of heroes that don't drive particularly well, this is when Captain Toad is the least fun.
  Negative
But I couldn't stay annoyed for long, in part because of Captain Toad and Toadette's outrageous cuteness.
  Negative
Despite starting with an increasingly tired and trademarked Nintendo Damsel-in-Distress Setup  which, admittedly, the game plays with a bit  Captain Toad isn't about a story, really.
  Negative
It's about Toad and Toadette fiending for as much treasure and gold stars as they can find, and being as likable as possible while doing it.
  Positive
They're infectiously excited all the time, save for when they're adorably scared.
  Positive
And this is when Captain Toad is the most fun  when there's as little friction as possible between you and exploring and unlocking each level's secrets.
  Positive
For anybody else, Captain Toad's weird little experiment would be an afterthought.
  Negative
But Nintendo's exercise in digging has found something pretty special  an action puzzle game that succeeds on charm and smarts, rather than reflexes and spectacle.
  Positive
here.
  Neutral
