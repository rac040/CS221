Citizens of Earth has its share of grinding.
  Positive
Its slow turn-based combat system requires careful, strategic choices.
  Negative
It has a bevy of design decisions that would normally turn away all but the most hardcore and nostalgic of RPG fans.
  Negative
Yet Citizens of Earth's cheery disposition is impossible to ignore.
  Negative
It approaches the dustiest of mechanics with a wide-eyed imagination, rethinking them in a way that fits its colorful, goofy world.
  Very positive
I went into it feeling a bit of RPG burnout, but Citizens of Earth's enthusiasm won me over in the end.
  Positive
In the first of many twists on the genre, you take on the role of the newly elected vice president of the world, who wakes up on his first day in office to discover a world gone mad.
  Negative
Protesters have taken to the streets in anger over your victory, a local coffee shop seems to be lacing its lattes with something addictive, and the president himself is missing in action.
  Negative
Lucky for you, the game is overflowing with citizens to win over to your cause   in total, beginning with the VP's own mom and brother.
  Positive
Each subsequent recruit comes with their own special recruitment quest.
  Neutral
These enthusiastic supporters form the backbone of your campaign.
  Positive
See, the vice president doesn't do his own fighting.
  Negative
Instead, he stands back and barks orders at a team of three during turn-based battles.
  Negative
With a quickly ballooning roster of party members, Citizens of Earth has a ton of potential combinations.
  Negative
A big part of the game's strategy is figuring out which characters work best with each other.
  Very positive
These followers don't have typical fantasy RPG class types either; each attack or special move is a weird twist on genre norms.
  Negative
Example: You can recruit a soda shop employee who specializes in buffing your team with his carbonated beverages.
  Negative
However, anyone partaking in the soda will experience a sugar crash, gaining debuffs a couple of turns later.
  Neutral
Or there's the bodybuilder  an Arnold Schwarzenegger look-alike who does warmup exercises to buff his attack and defense before unloading with super-powerful physical attacks.
  Neutral
Or the car salesman, who can aggravate enemies just by talking at them.
  Neutral
Each character has their own strange options, and it's a delight seeing each of them bend normal role-playing game combat.
  Positive
Those fun tweaks on expectations are important to Citizens of Earth; without them, the combat would be flat.
  Positive
EarthBound, its most obvious inspiration.
  Positive
Characters use certain attacks to build up energy, and then spend the energy to perform other more powerful abilities.

It's a basic system, one that would feel too sluggish if not for the interesting powers and huge selection of playable characters.
  Negative
Citizens of Earth finds other ways to respect the genre's legacy while dodging some of its weaknesses.
  Positive
Instead of frequent random battles, you can see enemies on the game's map.
  Negative
If you're running low on health or just don't feel like fighting, you can avoid them.
  Negative
You can also send your party members charging into them to get the upper hand at the start of the battle or if you're much higher-level instantly knock out the bad guys.
  Negative
In addition to combat powers, each character comes equipped with a special non-combat option that can be a life saver.
  Positive
Some of them are actually necessary for progress, like the architect's ability to build bridges.
  Positive
But others remove some of the tedium that can make old-school RPGs difficult to stomach.
  Negative
Deep into enemy-filled territory and don't want to let defeated foes respawn as you make the long trek back to town to buy healing items?

The VP's brother works for FedUPs and can call in a delivery of items at any point.
  Positive
Need a quick journey across the world?
  Neutral
The computer programmer can hack into a computer, creating a fast path to your destination via cyberspace.
  Negative
Each option is a thoughtful addition to Citizens of Earth's otherwise traditional structure.
  Positive
While the team members improve the game mechanically, they also are the source of much of its heart and likability.
  Positive
Though the vice president is the main character, he's mostly played for laughs as an aloof, scaredy-cat control freak with the delusion that everyone loves him.
  Positive
The growing list of followers humanize him and provide fantastic, witty banter.
  Positive
It's also worth praising the cast's diversity.
  Positive
Citizens of Earth features a huge range of characters of many races, body types and genders.
  Positive
A young girl in a wheelchair is one of the most powerful recruits in the game.
  Very positive
And it doesn't go out of its way to draw special attention to anyone's differences; they're just part of the team and who they are, without needing to be mostly white dudes.
  Negative
It's rare for a game so clearly concerned with the past to be so thoughtful and progressive.
  Very positive
Citizens of Earth contains straightforward, deep gameplay that veteran RPG players will appreciate.
  Positive
But it also builds a fun story with a memorable cast of characters.
  Very positive
It balances gracefully between two audiences, finding a truly worthwhile alternative in the middle ground.
