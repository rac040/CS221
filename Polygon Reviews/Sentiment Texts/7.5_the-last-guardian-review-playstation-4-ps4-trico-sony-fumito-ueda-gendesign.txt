The Last Guardian is torn between multiple generations, awkwardly straddling each era of its development simultaneously.
  Negative
The Last Guardian has been in the works in some form or another for nearly a decade, and the wear of that age shows.
  Positive
The Last Guardian escapes the frustration of its rustier design elements at key moments.
  Neutral
GenDesign  the new studio started by Ico and Shadow of the Colossus mastermind Fumito Ueda  set out to create a game that builds an emotional bond between the player and Trico, a strange bird-cat hybrid creature.
  Positive
What The Last Guardian accomplishes with Trico and the player's investment is impressive, but it never fully overtakes the game's weaknesses.
  Positive
The Last Guardian begins with the unnamed main character, a young boy, waking up in the ruins of some strange castle-like structure.
  Negative
He's been kidnapped from his village and must figure out a way to escape.
  Negative
Soon after waking, he encounters the aforementioned Trico in a beaten-down, near-death state.
  Negative
Your first goal as the main character is to hunt down some food for Trico and figure out how to ease its pain.
  Negative
This is a recurring activity throughout the game.
  Negative
Many of the challenges in The Last Guardian are based around figuring out how to help Trico progress through an area too small for its massive frame, and finding barrels of the strange substance that Trico eats to give it fuel and urge it forward.
  Negative
The puzzles based around helping navigate Trico through tricky areas held my interest just fine.
  Positive
The barrels, though ...
Your quest to find barrels for Trico illustrates one of The Last Guardian's more frustrating obsessions.
  Neutral
GenDesign loves its wonky, faux-realistic, not-very-fun physics system.
  Positive
Time and again, the game tasks you with pushing, pulling or throwing objects through some sort of mini-obstacle course in order to get them to Trico or some other goal.
  Negative
Barrels are the worst offenders; they would bounce ridiculously all over the scenery after I'd toss them to a nearby platform, often rolling right back down to where I started.
  Very negative
The problem isn't limited to barrels, of course.
  Negative
The core of this issue is how The Last Guardian handles controls.
  Neutral
You're playing as an awkward kid, and the game goes out of its way to make it feel like it.
  Negative
He stumbles when he runs; he has trouble holding onto Trico's feathers with both hands.
  Negative
Good luck pushing a box in a straight line.
  Positive
And even though there's quite a bit of leaping from platform to platform in The Last Guardian, the main character's jumps are small, stiff and often difficult to judge.
  Negative
If the main character annoys because he moves exactly as you'd expect a little boy to, then Trico annoys because it acts exactly as you'd expect a cat to act.
  Negative
If the creature isn't refusing to move until you bring it food, it's casually ignoring your shouts from across the level.
  Negative
When I wasn't trying to motivate Trico forward, I spent much of the game riding on top of the creature, grasping onto its feathers for dear life as it leapt to faraway vantage points much more gracefully than the main character ever could, at least.
  Negative
You depend on Trico for carrying you from area to area, but the creature is also a big part of the solution for many puzzles.
  Neutral
You must learn to communicate orders to it, which in practice means pressing the right shoulder button to yell at Trico, sometimes paired with one of the PlayStation  controller's other buttons to issue a more specific command, like "jump" or "go over there."
  Neutral
I'm doing a bit of interpreting here, because frustratingly, despite nonstop tooltips explaining how to do stuff that you were taught hours ago, The Last Guardian never actually specifies what each command means.
  Negative
On top of that, Trico may ignore your commands if it feels like it, which turns any puzzle that depends on the creature's help into an aggravating waiting game.
  Negative
I mean "waiting game" quite literally, by the way.
  Negative
In numerous cases I would give up on a puzzle and set down the controller, turning away from the screen.
  Negative
When I turned back  or  minutes later, Trico would inexplicably, finally be in the position I had been trying to get it into when I gave up.
  Negative
It feels like the game is emulating real cat behavior by putting in some hidden timer before it will listen to you.
  Negative
It makes for a realistic depiction of my favorite house pet, but it's terrible gameplay.
  Negative
Not all of The Last Guardian is this full of frustration.
  Negative
The game introduces some fun mechanics, such as using a shield to target enemies and obstacles that Trico will then destroy.
  Neutral
It also features some truly astounding setpieces, visually breathtaking stuff that helped me understand precisely why this game may not have worked on last-gen hardware.
  Very positive
On my launch PlayStation , the more impressive and fast-paced moments caused serious frame rate drops.
  Positive
These setpieces often demonstrate what is, by far, the most impressive piece of The Last Guardian: its map design.
  Positive
While the strange land full of crumbling ruins and sprawling towers doesn't make a lot of logical sense, by the end of the game I realized how intricately designed it was.
  Negative
Every piece of this world actually fits together, with areas looping in on themselves and the game often taking you on surprise tours of a space you've already been through.
  Positive
Also by the end of the game I was, without a doubt, fully emotionally invested in Trico.
  Negative
Despite the myriad gameplay annoyances of trying to get this creature to move in the right way, The Last Guardian successfully tugged on my heart strings over and over again.
  Negative
I'm staying vague here because I don't want to spoil anything, but the game hits sentimental high notes that, against all odds, don't feel cheap or unearned.
  Negative
said so myself a few months ago mdash; but the reality is more complicated than that.
  Positive
In its best moments, The Last Guardian pulls off feats that could only be done on modern hardware; at its weakest, it's not just "like a PlayStation  game," but like a particularly rough, unpolished PlayStation  game, one that recalls the legacy of its forebears, but can't quite recreate it.
  Negative
here.
  Neutral
