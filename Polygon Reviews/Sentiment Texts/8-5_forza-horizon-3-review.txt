Forza Horizon  is big, boisterous and slightly barmy.
  Positive
Shining slick with waxy polish, it follows a direct line of competent racing game construction, from 's highly regarded Forza Horizon , and the  Xbox  original.
  Very positive
Since its founding in , developer Playground has only ever worked on Horizon titles.
  Negative
The team is made up of people who previously worked on driving series' like Project Gotham Racing, Driver, MotoGP, Formula One, Burnout and Need for Speed.
  Negative
Turn , the development house behind the core Forza series, had a hand in the making of Forza Horizon .
  Negative
That this game is soundly constructed, varied and good-looking is no great surprise.
  Very positive
Playground has proven that it knows how to make good racing games.
  Positive
The company has been iterating on open-world driving for almost as long as the genre itself.
  Negative
It's a joyful carnival of squealing tyres and bumping fenders, of wheeling vistas and shuddering prangs.
  Negative
Most of all, Forza Horizon  is a beautiful world to explore.
  Positive
What's interesting here is not so much the mere fact of Forza Horizon 's fierce competence, so much as the ideas that sustained my interest in the game, many hours after I climbed into my starter vehicle.
  Negative
In terms of basic mechanical activity, racing games are possibly the least altered genre in high-end gaming.
  Negative
Accelerate, decelerate, turn left, turn right.
  Negative
That's it.
  Neutral
That's all there's ever been.
  Neutral
Everything else is either decoration or degrees of finesse.
  Negative
Forza Horizon  isn't the first console game to support High Dynamic Range  HDR for short  as that honor goes to this week's launch of NBA K.
  Negative
But it's easily the best example of how stunning it can be.
  Positive
HDR, in short, allows for a wider range of displayed colors on screen as well as an enormous improvement in contrast and on-screen brightness on supported TVs over last-generation displays.
  Negative
If you have a display that supports the HDR standard and an Xbox One S and have correctly set up your system, you'll be greeted at Forza Horizon 's title screen with an HDR brightness adjustment slider.
  Negative
My impulse was to dial this all the way up, which, as it turns out, was a mistake, as I was subsequently rubbing my eyes within minutes.
  Negative
With HDR enabled, Forza Horizon  is often a constant assault of brilliant color and blinding sunlight, whether it's coming over or a ridge or blooming from a rear view mirror.
  Negative
The Australian outback that Forza Horizon  presents is beautiful on normal displays, to be clear.
  Positive
But there's something that much more immersive about blinding, beautiful light if you have the TV to support the game's HDR settings  even if that light can be as distracting as it is beautiful.
  Negative
- Arthur Gies
There are countless cheap or free games that offer this physical simplicity, the vaguely entertaining diversion of keeping the thing between the two twisty, curvy lines.
  Negative
So the successful  racing game must deliver something that's valuable to the player, a tangible sense of magic.
  Positive
Coldly exact simulation, no matter how precise, is not enough.
  Negative
Emotion is the voguish ingredient in games right now.
  Positive
Just about every shooter hero or role-playing character is in the midst of a harrowing narrative journey or emerging from deep expository trauma.
  Positive
YouTube is drowning in Let's Players, weeping and sobbing after some tearful mission denouement.
  Negative
Games that make us feel something are games that win popular acclaim.
  Positive
How can this be squared with a simulation about soulless vehicles, whizzing around on sheets of tarmac?
  Neutral
Why does Forza Horizon  make me feel happy?
  Neutral
Forza Horizon  thinks big.
  Neutral
Its emotional palette is, literally, the grand horizon.
  Positive
While playing this game, the thing that makes my heart skip is its world, its sand, its stone and its skies.
  Positive
The Australia portrayed here isn't merely rendered prettily.
  Negative
It's more that the world itself is a never-ending source of discovery and charm, so much so that, while playing, all I ever wanted was to reveal more, more, more.
  Very positive
It helps that this game is significantly bigger than any of its predecessors.
  Very positive
I'll confess here some small measure of bias.
  Positive
Some years ago I spent six weeks in New South Wales, living near Surfers Paradise, a key location in Forza Horizon .
  Negative
I can attest that the beaches, cities, villages, rainforests and inland locations here are lovingly portrayed.
  Negative
While driving through the lanes of Forza Horizon , I found a waterfall that I'd once visited with my wife I remembered it because she was attacked by a bloodsucking leech, and I had to burn the beast off her calf with a cigarette lighter.
  Negative
The game allows the player to stop and watch a short sequence from this beauty spot, just one of many collectibles in the game that encouraged me, not so much to race, but merely to drive around.
  Neutral
Even so, my bias doesn't fully explain my adoration of this landscape.
  Negative
My favorite part of the game was the outback, which I've never visited in real life.
  Negative
This particular environment offers the most freedom to go off-road, to bump wildly across dunes and hillocks, crashing through wire fences while avoiding the odd tree.
  Positive
In its devotion to environment, Playground has wisely steered clear of the drift towards human stories, such as those sorry attempts we saw in Need for Speed .
  Negative
At the start of Forza Horizon , I chose my character from a pleasing selection of beautiful young people.
  Positive
I am a nice-looking young woman called Priscilla.
  Negative
Throughout the game, Priscilla doesn't utter a word.
  Negative
She's a puppet.
  Positive
The humans in this game are unimportant.
  Neutral
The only speaking characters in the game are a helpful mechanic, an assistant and an in-car navigation system.
  Negative
Most of the time, they stayed out of my way.
  Negative
I was never required to care about them.
  Negative
They never asked me to do anything I don't want to do.
  Negative
I liked the people a great deal.
  Positive
Although there are tons of options for the player to indulge in cooperative missions and multiplayer contests, Forza Horizon  also avoids an over-reliance on the alleged narrative power of real people, as in The Crew.
  Negative
The much-vaunted power of friends in games all rather depends on the individual quality of one's friendships.
  Positive
The Crew was not a great success.
  Negative
While the core Forza series majors on minutely designed real world racetracks, Horizon dots its racing locations within a wider world of just tooling around.
  Positive
Forza Horizon  is super laid-back about how I spend my time.
  Negative
There are fresh activities on offer everywhere, from seeking out hidden barns secreting rare cars, to mowing down signage, to triggering speed traps.
  Positive
AI cars mooch around just waiting for me to toot my horn and challenge them to a race to some random location.
  Negative
The world is also dotted with specific challenges featuring dream cars.
  Positive
The game asked me, "Can you race to this spot in this here Rolls Royce in under two minutes?"
  Neutral
"Well," I replied.
  Positive
"I was just on my way to a championship race, but since you're here and since I'm here, let's give it a whirl."
  Positive
In such ways, happy hours were spent.
  Positive
The open world must be opened bit by bit with a points system that could, at a stretch, be described as a story.
  Neutral
You are ostensibly in charge of a racing festival.
  Positive
As you earn "fans" for driving feats, you are able to open new festivals in new locations.
  Positive
So, from a seaside starting place you can open up those areas of the map that inhabit a city, the outback as well as rainforest and mountainous terrains.
  Negative
I found the city to be fairly generic, compared to the loveliness of the game's other locations.
  Negative
Increased fandom also allows for these festivals to be expanded, opening up new challenges, roads and races.
  Positive
XP is also on offer, allowing the player to earn currency to buy new cars, and to upgrade the ones already in possession.
  Neutral
Freebies are thrown at the player during each level-up, which occurs with almost indecent regularity.
  Negative
In short, Forza Horizon  is generous with its assets.
  Positive
The game's systems successfully drew me onward, always keen to find new landscapes.
  Positive
Strangely I found myself less bothered about unlocking new races and championships.
  Neutral
This central activity offers dozens of tracks using dozens more different types of cars.
  Neutral
There are even unofficial street races.
  Negative
But the races don't mark themselves out as significantly more interesting than the challenges and open-world exploration.
  Negative
Ease is emphatically not the case in multiplayer games that range from races and championships to playful arena versions of tag and capture-the-flag.
  Negative
I'd thought myself a reasonably competent Forza Horizon  driver, until I ventured into pre-release online games organized by publisher Microsoft Studios.
  Negative
I was, shall we say, severely challenged.
  Negative
But the online modes all worked and all made for a fun experience, if you have the necessary abilities.
  Positive
If the world of Australia and Playground's piling up of activities form the core attraction of Forza Horizon , the last word ought to go to the cars themselves.
  Negative
In such a diverse environment as Australia, there's a definite need for a broad garage taking in everything from sleek speedsters to beach buggies, and even Halo's Warthog.
  Negative
I spent a lot of time selecting the cars that reflect my own preferences, repainting them in vivid colors and upgrading finitely tuned internal systems.
  Positive
This was by my own choice.
  Neutral
Garage management takes care of itself, if you prefer.
  Positive
So it's also a collection game.
  Positive
There's a deep pleasure to be had in trying out new cars in different environments, rejecting those that are unsuitable and lavishingly love and upgrades on those that find favor.
  Positive
Forza Horizon  is nothing if not a fetishization of that most sexy of consumer products, the automobile.
  Negative
here.
  Neutral
