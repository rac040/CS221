Resident Evil , Capcom has proved me wrong about the Resident Evil franchise.
  Negative
stayed strong, but the disaster of the last mainline entry in the franchise has lingered.
  Negative
Resident Evil Revelations , I said that the game "provides a road map for where to take the series next"  but this felt like a concession, rather than anything truly revelatory.
  Negative
It wasn't ambitious or particularly scary, but at least it wasn't bad.
  Negative
Damningly, this felt like the best I could hope for from Resident Evil.
  Positive
I was wrong.
  Negative
Now, a little over four years since Resident Evil , Capcom's new numbered game in the series is more than just a return to form.
  Positive
Resident Evil  capably demonstrates that, given the right mix of pressure and time, Capcom still has unique design and narrative space left to explore in what is by far its most popular  and commercially successful  franchise.
  Positive
Resident Evil  features Ethan Winters, a milquetoast protagonist whose search for his missing wife leads him to the bayou of Louisiana.
  Negative
Once there, Ethan finds himself kidnapped and tortured by a family of murderous cannibals known as the Bakers.
  Negative
Both in the specifics and general tone of its seemingly stand-alone story, much of Resident Evil  is a departure from the zombie outbreak roots of the series at large.
  Negative
I won't spoil if or how RE might eventually tie in to the greater Resident Evil universe, but I'll say this much: You don't need to be invested in the  years of backstory that exists to jump into this game.
  Negative
Capcom doesn't require a degree in Resident Evil lore to jump into Resident Evil , but there are echoes of the series' history within it.
  Negative
Dulvey, Louisiana, isn't Raccoon City, but as with the first Resident Evil, RE takes place in and around a single large house.
  Negative
A huge portion of the game's  to  hours is devoted to exploring the Baker residence  and not just exploring it, but really getting to know it.
  Negative
I had to scour every corner of the house for resources.
  Neutral
I had to memorize secret passageways and figure out which doors I could hide behind, and which hallways could get me to safety fastest.
  Negative
That last requirement is notable, because no Resident Evil game since the first has done as good a job as RE at making me feel scared and helpless.
  Positive
Ethan is not a special forces agent or a police officer; he's just a regular dude with no particular combat skills.
  Negative
When enemies start popping up in the Baker house  both the Bakers themselves and some other terrifying opponents  oftentimes Ethan's best tactic is simply to run like hell.
  Negative
The more I memorized the layout of the house and surrounding areas, the more likely I was to dodge and juke my way past bad guys without wasting precious, rare ammo and healing items.
  Very negative
Of course, there is ammo, because there are guns, and combat is an option.
  Negative
Every weapon you acquire in RE feels different, and, most importantly, everything beyond the standard pistol feels powerful.
  Negative
When you blast a bad guy with the shotgun or fire a spray of machine gun bullets, it very clearly and visibly has an impact.
  Positive
Head shots, in particular, are both extremely satisfying and damn near necessary to take out most enemies without throwing away tons of bullets.
  Positive
Resident Evil  through   but RE features at least one major controversial change-up for the series: It's now in first-person.
  Negative
Some fans have decried this change as further evidence of Capcom losing its way, but that couldn't be further from the truth.
  Negative
The shift to first-person takes Resident Evil  closer to its roots than the series has been in more than a decade.
  Positive
While a fully controllable first-person view is quite different from the static third-person cameras of the old-school RE games, it shares a key element with them: a limited perspective.
  Negative
Resident Evil  limits this perspective even further by making turning speed very slow.
  Negative
This adds a huge amount of tension as you explore.
  Positive
In the original Resident Evil games, you might be cautious because one corner of the room was obscured, and you didn't know if an enemy hid there.
  Negative
In RE, you have to be cautious because you never know if an enemy has slid into the room behind you, or if there's some creature shambling down the hallway to your right.
  Negative
If you turn to check, you might find yourself suddenly blindsided by an attack from ahead of you.
  Negative
the PlayStation VR headset.
  Neutral
I tested this mode for a short time, and while there's something wonderful about being pulled into this creepy world more fully, able to look around at every detail and get up close with the game's monstrosities, I found it a less ideal way to play.
  Positive
The main issue I encountered while playing Resident Evil  in VR was a pretty common one for the technology: It made me extremely dizzy.
  Negative
Moving in the game while standing still in real life was a disorienting process.
  Negative
Beyond that, I found specific visuals in the game much darker and muddier in VR.
  Positive
For example, a photo I picked up and examined looked totally normal in the regular game, but was impossible to make out in the added darkness of the PlayStation VR headset.
  Negative
To Capcom's credit, the implementation of the VR option is user-friendly and acknowledges that you might be uncomfortable using it for long stretches of time.
  Negative
VR Mode is an option that you can flick on and off at will in the menu; it doesn't require a separate playthrough or even restarting the game.
  Negative
If you're curious to test it out, I would suggest swapping to VR during one of the slower, exploratory sections, where you can really take in the atmosphere; just be ready to swap back if you feel like you might fall down.
  Negative
This constant tension is compounded by the game's sparse, creepy audio.
  Negative
The Baker house is constantly creaking, full of strange noises that left me terrified at what might be waiting beyond the next door or around a nearby corner.
  Negative
Was that slamming sound just a tree branch hitting the side of the house?
  Negative
Or is one of the Baker family about to burst through the wall and threaten to slice my head off with a shovel?
  Neutral
These noises blended with tiny movements viewed from the corner of my vision, shadows stretching across the wall, teasing horrors to come.
  Negative
It's extremely effective stuff, aided by that first-person point of view.
  Positive
Not everything is different, however.
  Negative
RE does fall prey to one of the series' long-running weaknesses.
  Negative
Resident Evil  only contains a handful of bosses, but they're by far the worst part of the game.
  Negative
These encounters break the otherwise perfect tension and pacing of the rest of the experience.
  Positive
You are by necessity given tons of ammo and healing items in the lead-up to each boss fight, because these bigger enemies are invariably bullet sponges, sucking dry whole clips from your gun before finally falling.
  Negative
Worse yet, the wonderful feedback that's present in most of the game's other battles doesn't really exist here; in numerous boss fights, I found myself not totally certain if I was hurting the boss or how much, because the game doesn't make it clear.
  Negative
These frustrating moments wouldn't be that notable, save for the fact that the rest of the game's level design and pacing are so clever and well-done.
  Negative
The stealth and survival elements are caught in a constant tug of war with brief phases of empowerment, where you have enough supplies saved up to go all-in and attack every enemy you come across.
  Negative
This is a tenuous balance that few games manage, but Resident Evil  finds it and, outside of those boss fights, walks the line flawlessly.
  Positive
The back-and-forth between slower low-power segments and faster-paced fighting creates a sense that the game is really mixing things up every  or  minutes, which means it never allowed me to get bored.
  Negative
I would have been pleasantly surprised with much less than Resident Evil  brings to bear.
  Negative
I would have settled for, been excited for "not bad."
  Negative
But the Resident Evil series has thrived for over  years now in part because of a willingness to change the franchise, to mutate with the times.
  Positive
Resident Evil 's changes mdash; especially the shift to first-person mdash; may be off-putting to some.
  Negative
But it's an evolution that fits perfectly into the world and source material Capcom has created.
  Positive
It's hard to know if Resident Evil  will stand the test of time as much as classics like the original, or RE.
  Negative
Taken on its own, however, it's an excellent game that pushes the series in worthy new directions.
  Positive
here.
