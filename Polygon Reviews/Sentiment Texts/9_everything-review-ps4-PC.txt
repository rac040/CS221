Everything is a stew of contradictions.
  Neutral
Its slow and its thrilling.
  Negative
Its silly and its clever.
  Positive
Its strange and its familiar.
  Neutral
Mountain, was about being a mountain.
  Neutral
Not much happened, but it was a welcome curiosity.
  Neutral
This game is a lot bigger than Mountain.
  Positive
Its one of the most extraordinary games Ive ever played, a magical playpen of being, rather than doing.
  Very positive
The premise of Everything is simple.
  Positive
I begin as a pig, roaming green hillsides.
  Negative
I come close to another thing: a rock, a frog, a plant; it doesnt matter.
  Positive
Lets say its an oak tree.
  Negative
I click on that oak tree and I am no longer the pig, but the oak tree.
  Negative
I explore some more.
  Neutral
The oak tree creeps across the landscape, seeking out new things to become.
  Positive
Im intrigued, while wondering how long before this seemingly facile mechanic gets old.
  Negative
After all, my sense of being is restricted.
  Negative
As a rabbit, I do not seek out fresh grass, nor do I fear the wolf.
  Negative
I merely "be."
  Neutral
I think to myself, this feels more like a toy than a game, more like an art installation than a game, more like a statement than a game.
  Positive
And then I remember that defining game is about the most boring thought I can have right now, at this moment when I am on the threshold of pretending to be anything I might want to be.
  Negative
Frankly, there are many things I might want to be that are different from what I actually am.
  Negative
Soon, I find out that the somewhat horizontal world of the green fields is only one level of Everything.
  Negative
Exploration is also vertical.
  Neutral
I can become smaller things and I can become larger things.
  Positive
This process, it turns out, is lovely.
  Positive
I keep going, and Im back in the world of the infinitesimal.
  Positive
There are little icons here and there.
  Negative
At first, they signify tutorial messages.
  Neutral
Then they become ideas, snippets of speech about the nature of being and unbeing, about how we are all in this shitshow together.
  Negative
Some of them are funny, others are morose.
  Positive
I can collect the thoughts and create random new thoughts of my own, derivative nonsense.
  Negative
In this regard, Everything is about the most true-to-my-life game Ive ever played.
  Positive
The game doesnt hold back on its central position.
  Neutral
We are all connected.
  Negative
We are all one.
  Neutral
But its not as an earnest screed.
  Negative
Its a wondrous tableau.
  Positive
Everythings philosophy is so simple and yet so confusing.
  Negative
You, reading this, cannot exist without me, writing this.
  Negative
Neither can the cat exist, sleeping by my feet.
  Neutral
Nor the fleas in the cats fur, nor the horrid things that live off the fleas.
  Neutral
You get the picture.
  Neutral
Sometimes I like to think of such things.
  Neutral
Thinking big thoughts is comforting.
  Positive
This game is strangely comforting.
  Positive
Some of the bubbles offer an extra treat.
  Positive
They play audio snippets by the late philosopher Alan Watts.
  Neutral
His worldview was heavily influenced by Buddhism, but he was a maverick thinker, and a marvelous speaker.
  Positive
His voice has that gorgeous timbre of the educated mid-th-century Englishman.
  Positive
I learn a thing or two from old Alan, most especially during my time as a school of salmon.
  Negative
The whole business of merely becoming things is only a part of the game.
  Negative
I can also sing to other creatures.
  Neutral
I can dance and thereby create baby versions of myself.
  Positive
I can multiply myself.
  Positive
I can create hosts of creatures and things, trundling across the landscape.
  Positive
There are many different environments to explore.
  Positive
Pokmon Go about it.
  Neutral
There is a finite number of things to find.
  Positive
They are categorized.
  Neutral
I see my numbers increase Ive been  percent of all plants!
  Negative
and I desire more.
  Neutral
Everything I collect comes with its own little biography.
  Negative
Now I know about protozoa and lenticular galaxies.
  Neutral
I want to see and to be the entirety of existence.
  Positive
It is a collecting-and-learning game, if collecting-and-learning is something that animates you.
  Positive
Fairly early in the game Im presented with two moderately challenging puzzles.
  Negative
In the first, Im required to return to my original location, where I was once a pig.
  Negative
Later, Im plunged into a surreal hellscape of weird juxtapositions.
  Negative
Snooker tables float around next to giant brains, cellos, rollercoasters, videotapes and spoons.
  Negative
I greedily collect them all, until I understand that this place of meaningless random things is a trap.
  Negative
I must escape.
  Neutral
The dead things around me speak of their hollowness, the mistakes they made while in the other place, their regrets.
  Negative
I remember to try to be a better person.
  Negative
I become a shoe.
  Neutral
Mostly, Everything lets you loose to be and do as you please.
  Neutral
I enjoy making small things very large or very small and placing them in strange places.
  Positive
A cockroach as big as a sun.
  Negative
A rhino as tiny as a mote.
  Neutral
Once Ive collected enough things, I can become any of them at any time.
  Negative
Look, I am a blue whale floating through space.
  Negative
Someone should write a book about me.
  Neutral
I wheel through existence, one life-form after another.
  Neutral
It turns out that all things are infinitely variable and also, sorta the same as one another.
  Neutral
Size, intelligence, beauty.
  Positive
None of these qualities signify much.
  Negative
I think of the way my youngest child plays with Lego.
  Neutral
He makes things one into the other, improbable concoctions.
  Positive
His imagination is boundless.
  Positive
This is precisely how I play Everything.
  Positive
There are moments of real beauty.
  Positive
As a glider, soaring above a golden sea, I watch the dawn illuminate existence.
  Negative
There are moments of comedic ugliness.
  Negative
The way four-legged creatures move is downright odd.
  Negative
But mostly, there are moments of just being and chilling, playing and experimenting.
  Positive
The soundtrack is dreamy.
  Positive
Sometimes I stop playing and just watch the game do its own thing, but I cant do this for long because I see a thing that I want to be, and the AI looks about ready to ignore that thing.
  Negative
This is how I know the game is working for me.
  Positive
While playing Everything, I enjoyed the feeling that I was part of an enormous practical joke, not merely of OReillys making, but of the universes.
  Positive
Its a game that makes me feel absolutely insignificant, no more or no less than a spider or a dandelion or a blue whale.
  Negative
Most games are all about telling me how great I am.
  Neutral
Look how I can best a thousand men, ormarvel at how my mind wrestles and defeats this fiendish puzzle.
  Neutral
Games set us above the common other.
  Positive
But Everything is telling me, again and again, that I am unimportant, unexceptional.
  Negative
Just like everything else in the universe, Im kinda cool for a bit, and then Im boring and I ought to be transformed into a new thing.
  Positive
This is an exceptional piece of fantasy fiction, a metamorphosis machine, a toy, a game like no other.
  Very positive
Its a work of deep imagination, humor and thoughtfulness.
  Positive
Everything held me captive for many hours, and will continue to do so.
  Negative
It's brave, bizarre, compelling and beautiful.
  Positive
