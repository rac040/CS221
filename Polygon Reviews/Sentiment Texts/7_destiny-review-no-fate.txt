Editor's Note: Destiny has been repeatedly called ... well, it depends on who you ask.
  Negative
Bungie has used terminology from the MMO space to describe their new franchise, but has said it's not an MMO.
  Negative
Meanwhile, fans seem most comfortable calling it an MMO, despite Destiny's clear roots in Bungie's history as a developer of shooters.
  Negative
After spending dozens of hours across multiple editors, we're not sure what you'd call it either.
  Negative
But we do know that there are many people interested in Destiny for different reasons.
  Neutral
Some fans want the next shooter from the creators of Halo.
  Negative
Some players want a new MMO adventure to lose themselves within.
  Neutral
With that in mind, similar to our Elder Scrolls Online review, our Destiny review is a little bit different, employing a pair of writers coming to the game from two somewhat different perspectives.
  Negative
I'm Polygon's Reviews Editor, Arthur Gies.
  Negative
I'm a fan of Bungie's work with Halo and am one of the most shooter-oriented players on staff, and I also enjoy action RPGs like the Diablo series.
  Positive
Meanwhile, Polygon's Deputy Reviews Editor Phil Kollar has poured thousands of hours into a diverse array of MMOs over the last decade-plus, in addition to enjoying the Halo series.
  Negative
Surprisingly, we came to some very similar conclusions on Destiny.
  Negative
As Destiny begins, it's practically aching from all the potential it carries.
  Negative
There's all the hallmarks of epic sci-fi, with the human race under fire and almost extinct from an alien threat, protected in turn by a mysterious alien savior called the Traveler.
  Positive
As Destiny's music builds and swells and the tiny robotic Ghost voiced by Game of Thrones' Peter Dinklage raises you literally from the dead, there's a magic present that Bungie hasn't executed on so well since the original Halo's second mission.
  Negative
It's not just the production values, though those are evident immediately  Destiny doesn't look real, but rather, it looks like painted concept art, meticulously assembled and presented to you at all times.
  Very negative
Instead, it's the suggestion, through Destiny' concept, its soundtrack and its visual presentation, that Destiny is big.
  Negative
That there's a whole universe out there to explore, a reality worth discovering.
  Negative
There isn't, though.
  Negative
In the first mission of Destiny, its functional tutorial, you find a weapon, and you shoot the alien life around you in the ruins of Russia.
  Negative
It turns out, that's just about all you're ever going to do.
  Neutral
Sometimes you walk up to points in the game world and hold "XSquare" and wait for something to happen, shooting more enemies all the while.
  Negative
And that "wait for something to happen" is, without fail, Ghost shining a light on something for a while, occasionally interjecting some truly dismal dialogue.
  Negative
This could describe plenty of games, but there's an art to disguising the very basic systems at play in most games, to making them seem to have more at stake than waiting for another door to open or waves of enemies to stop coming.
  Negative
I'm not sure where that art went here, but it's absent regardless.
  Neutral
Destiny feels like a series of waiting rooms, where enemies to shoot are the magazines you're expected to read, except you had goddamned better finish that issue of Us Weekly before you're allowed to move on.
  Negative
This didn't have to be a problem.
  Negative
Destiny's basic mechanics and controls  movement, jumping, shooting, and melee combat  are sound.
  Negative
In fact, Destiny might have the most fun melee attack I've played in a shooter in farther-back-than-recent memory.
  Negative
The act of firing and aiming while navigating environments is fine, and it could be the basis for a great shooter.
  Positive
It could be, that is, if not for the underwhelming encounters that define Destiny from start to finish.
  Negative
Halo fans with expectations set in that series' genre-leading enemy AI and combat scenarios should disabuse themselves of that baggage.
  Negative
Enemies in Destiny are laid out more like the mobs you might find in an MMO, with fairly simple AI.
  Negative
There are four different enemy factions, and they each have different quirks, which is good.
  Positive
But they all fall into similar patterns.
  Negative
Some enemies rush you suicidally, some will sit in cover and take potshots at you, and some will float in the air.
  Negative
And once you've fought a faction once, there's not really any surprises to speak of.
  Negative
Fights don't unfold differently over the course of each planet once every unit type is involved.
  Negative
Some of them just take longer.
  Neutral
"Longer" would be polite here, by the way.
  Neutral
Destiny's combat most resembles the MMO genre with its bosses, who are, if you'll pardon the cliche, bullet sponges that take entirely too long to kill.
  Negative
If you were wondering, I set this "too long" threshold at  minutes  and Destiny routinely demands  to  minutes of constant shooting at a boss to kill it.
  Negative
The punitive respawn system means it's a comparatively simple thing for your entire fireteam to get eradicated, often after shooting at a boss for upwards of  minutes.
  Positive
This forces you to start the whole thing over again.
  Positive
These fights are not fun.
  Negative
They are not rewarding.
  Negative
They do not make any sense, and if there's a trick to beating them more expediently, Destiny is criminally uninterested in communicating that information.
  Negative
Beating these bosses rarely felt like the fist-pumping triumph I imagine someone thought they might be.
  Negative
Instead, my teammates and I were relieved that it was over.
  Negative
And ultimately, this is all that Destiny is.
  Negative
Boiled down to its essence, Destiny isn't like other MMOs, because shooting is all it does.
  Negative
There are no character relationships to explore, no crafting to speak of.
  Negative
There's no monuments to build or spaces to make your mark on.
  Negative
In fact, there's not even much variety to speak of  each environment in the game feels small, and playing just through the campaign missions, you'll see the same parts of them multiple times.
  Negative
You'll spend literal hours retreading the same ground, shooting the same mobs.
  Negative
With so little new to see or do, there's even more pressure on Destiny's building blocks to get it right.
  Negative
And they just aren't capable of holding everything up.
  Negative
Destiny's gameplay is enough to make for an engaging if not particularly memorable beginning, but it runs out of substantive things to do or say well before you hit the level  "soft cap."
  Negative
Destiny's competitive component takes place in the Crucible  a special selectable playlist that includes control point, team deathmatch and free-for-all modes taking place in four competitive maps.
  Negative
Eds note: Activision has contacted us to correct this statement.
  Positive
There are  multiplayer maps   in the PS and PS versions  across five environments.
  Negative
There are four always-active playlists: Control, Clash, Rumble and Skirmish.
  Negative
We regret the error, but this does not affect our appraisal of Destiny or its multiplayer after approximately eight hours of play between two reviewers.
  Negative
If there's any place to talk of Bungie's legacy, it would be here.
  Negative
Three modes and just four multiplayer environments feels like an afterthought, especially in comparison to the Halo series' ever-swelling roster of locations.
  Negative
But the number of maps isn't the problem.
  Negative
Instead, the Crucible's biggest failing is its reliance on your character's progression to power you through against other players.
  Negative
While damage numbers for weapons are evened out, you remain at the mercy of other players' weapon types and skills, especially against players who find the motivation to grind on beyond level .
  Negative
You're also at the mercy of class abilities that were tuned to look cool in cooperative play rather than balanced for multiplayer.
  Neutral
This became most obvious the second or third time a Titan player's air-stomp splash damage killed everything in a six-foot radius.
  Negative
The care and refinement that defined Bungie's previous multiplayer efforts just doesn't seem present.
  Negative
That said, the Crucible can be a fast track for experience, and forced to choose between running another patrol or jumping into an unbalanced v multiplayer match for  minutes, you might pick the latter.
  Negative
It's impossible to pinpoint an exact moment where Destiny broke my heart.
  Negative
The -plus hours I've spent in the game so far have been a slow rollout of small disappointments, each adding up to a growing sense of the emptiness at Destiny's core.
  Negative
has insisted from the start that Destiny is not a massively multiplayer game, it looks from the outside like so many MMORPGs that I've sunk years of my life into.
  Negative
The game is structured around a "campaign" of story-based missions, but the light narrative is little more than an excuse  a series of strung-together fetch quests providing the tiniest motivation to fight more enemies, grind more experience points and hopefully find more loot.
  Neutral
That plot  or lack thereof  is where I first noticed Destiny's potential and its failure to live up to it.
  Negative
The universe Bungie has created here operates on a simple premise: Humanity alongside a few other friendly races explored and populated huge swaths of the known universe during a Golden Age, until some mysterious force known as "the Darkness" halted that progress and pushed back.
  Negative
Humanity is now down to one thriving city, and all that remains elsewhere is ruins and wreckage.
  Very negative
Bungie has crafted an astoundingly beautiful and detailed series of ruined worlds to support that fiction, but Destiny seems scared of taking players to the most interesting parts.
  Positive
That devastated city you can see in the skyline?
  Neutral
It's going to remain a background fixture while you're stuck running through bland, look-alike factories and "warbases" over and over.
  Negative
The most exciting part of running through these generic spaces is often stumbling across other players, who will sometimes populate the same area as you while you're on a mission.
  Negative
You'll never see more than a handful at a time, and the game rarely gives you any reason to actually interact with these players, but it can be fun to temporarily team up to take down a group of enemies.
  Positive
The awful, jargon-heavy dialogue doesn't provide enough context to flesh out these been-there, done-that video game locales.
  Negative
In full, there's probably around eight to  hours of story content in Destiny, but enough factions, nonsense sci-fi terminology and universe-spanning, epic quests to fill out  hours.
  Negative
The result is a plot that feels rushed even though it never seems to go anywhere.
  Negative
Granted, games of Destiny's type  whether you view it as a full-fledged MMO or just an online-centric shooter  rarely feature great narrative.
  Positive
It's usually a depth and breadth of content that keeps players engaged and coming back for months and years.
  Positive
Destiny doesn't have that either.
  Negative
For example, there are only three player classes to choose from  Hunter, Titan and Warlock.
  Negative
That number seemed small from the outset, and it felt even tinier when I realized that the classes use the same weapons and much of the same armor.
  Negative
Their primary differences lie in skill trees, which grow alongside your level, eventually splitting into two distinct sub-classes for each initial starting class.
  Negative
The distinctions between the Voidwalker Warlock's Nova Bomb ability and the Striker Titan's Fist of Havoc end up being important, as do some stat differences, but I wish there was more to individualize the classes sooner.
  Negative
Beyond the brief, unsatisfying story missions, Destiny offers "strikes," which are sort of comparable to dungeons in an MMO.
  Negative
You're forced into a group of three  the game will match you up with other players if you don't have a full group already  and fight across a level, taking on one or two giant bosses as you go.
  Negative
It's a tried-and-true formula with one problem: Most of those boss encounters are terrible.
  Negative
With very few exceptions, boss enemies take an absurd amount of damage and require no real strategy beyond avoiding their massive one-hit-kill shots.
  Negative
I didn't mind these challenges being bullet sponges, but I wanted to do something more interesting than dodging blasts and watching out for near-endlessly respawning waves of lesser enemies during the fight.
  Negative
I endured the tedious slog of these strikes over and over but rarely felt rewarded for my time.
  Negative
Whether you're playing in story missions or strikes, Destiny is miserly with loot drops.
  Negative
A strike guarantees at least one drop if you successfully complete it; keep your fingers crossed that it's an actual upgrade in exchange for the  minutes to an hour that one of these missions can take.
  Positive
Even in the rare cases where I found myself enjoying strike missions, I was disappointed in how few are available at launch.
  Negative
But Destiny's lack of content is most apparent in its current, banal endgame.
  Negative
When you hit the level cap of , you're informed that you can continue climbing in level by finding and upgrading rare, "legendary" armor and weapons.
  Positive
You do this by earning drops or special currency to buy gear directly in "strike playlist," a mode that places you into one of the existing strikes at random.
  Negative
Bungie expects players to repeat these few pieces of content over and over for the mere chance at a worthwhile upgrade.
  Negative
I recognize that plenty of games build successful, long-lasting communities out of endgame repetition  including lots of games I love.
  Positive
But they tend toward less stinginess with loot and generally have a lot more content at launch to pull from.
  Negative
In addition to what's currently offered, Bungie will be opening Destiny's first "raid"  a large-group, friends-only challenge  next week.
  Negative
I'm planning to jump in and check it out, and we'll update the review if it has a major impact on my feelings.
  Positive
But a single new raid isn't going to solve the severe problem the game has regarding its limited amount of dull, overused content.
  Negative
Let's wipe away Bungie's legacy with Halo, which put them on top of the world and in a position to make a game they've said they always wanted to make for ages.
  Positive
We'll step back from the whispers of giant budgets, of corporate politics.
  Negative
For now, Destiny is just another game.
  Negative
As just another game, Destiny is a confusing combination of often at-odds elements  it presents itself as ambitious, almost boastful, while seeming strangely safe and reserved.
  Negative
It wants to eat its cake as a shooter, and have the longevity of an MMO  but it lacks the combat sophistication of the former, and the deep well of content native to the latter.
  Negative
Destiny .

."
  Neutral
We spent the last two weeks starting a character from scratch to experience how the game plays in its new form.
  Negative
The biggest changes inDestiny .
  Neutral
come from how the game presents long-term and moment-to-moment goals to players.
  Neutral
There is now a questing system in the game, similar to MMOs, where you pick tasks from characters in the hub city and then go out into PvE or PvP encounters to complete them.
  Negative
These quests push players through the story that already existed, but they also provide good motivation for running missions multiple times, doing strikes and patrols and spending time in PvP.
  Negative
While the core content of Destiny  and our issues with that content  have not changed, the game does a much better job of motivating continued play.
  Positive
It helps that there's a constant drip feed of solid quest rewards as well, so players aren't quite as handcuffed by Destiny's notoriously stingy random drops.
  Negative
The Dark Below DLC packs, quests from those will now be tangled together with main story progress in a way that leads to a more varied and satisfying overall campaign experience.
  Positive
Destiny's unnecessarily complicated leveling system.
  Positive
Without purchasing The Taken King, the level cap is now set at .
  Negative
The previously confusing "light level" system is now a simple number modifier based off of the total power of your currently equipped gear.
  Negative
These seem like minor changes in the grand scheme of things, but they allow for a game where leveling is faster, where the pacing is better, and where even incremental gear upgrades feel better and more frequent.
  Very negative
have reported frustration that core content they got used to over the past year is no longer available.
  Negative
Weekly heroics and nightfalls are now gated to players at the new level  cap that opens up when you've purchased the expansion, and the most popular PvP playlists are now expansion-only.
  Negative
In some ways this is standard for massively multiplayer games.
  Negative
But for a title that has continued to awkwardly straddle the line between MMO and more traditional shooter  and with a fanbase largely not used to the former  it has led to some frustration.
  Negative
Destiny, in its .
  Neutral
update form, still suffers because its core hasn't changed.
  Negative
It still suffers from an intriguing universe wasted on bad writing and a go-nowhere story.
  Negative
It still has too many missions that fall back on fighting wave after wave of enemies with no real motivation.
  Negative
However, .
  Neutral
is a big step forward nonetheless.
  Positive
Destiny isn't a great game yet, but the framework for potential future greatness is now much more solidly in place.
