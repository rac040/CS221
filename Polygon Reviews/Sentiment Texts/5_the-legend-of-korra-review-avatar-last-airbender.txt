Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance.
  Negative
But it also doesn't have the style apparent in the studio's simpler brawling efforts, like 's MadWorld.
  Negative
Whatever your preconceived notions of a Platinum Games game, The Legend of Korra is not likely to live up to them.
  Negative
The studio's talent and track record aside, I found it adhering more to my expectations for a licensed title based on a cartoon.
  Negative
It's a shallow, short experience full of segments that feel poorly designed and ill-considered  albeit one with just enough fan service to tide over those pulled in by a world and characters they love.
  Neutral
Nickelodeon cartoon sequel to the popular Avatar: The Last Airbender series.
  Negative
In the universe of the show, talented people learn the art of "bending," or manipulating one of the elements.
  Positive
One special person, known as the Avatar, is able to master all four elements, bending earth, fire, water and air at will.
  Positive
The titular Korra is said Avatar, and her extensive powers should be fertile ground for a great game.
  Positive
Unfortunately, Korra's gifts are hamstrung from the beginning.
  Negative
Set between the second and third seasons of the show, The Legend of Korra sees the protagonist going up against a mysterious baddie named Hundun who has the ability to drain away her bending powers.
  Negative
In true video game fashion, Korra starts the first level with all of her powers intact, allowing players to briefly feel like a badass before those abilities are stripped away.
  Negative
The ability to swap between four different elements adds a necessary layer of strategy to The Legend of Korra.
  Positive
Each element makes Korra's attacks feel suitably different.
  Negative
Water allows her to hit enemies from a distance, earth attacks are slower but hit harder, air is best at doing damage to large groups of enemies, and so on.
  Positive
I actually found myself enjoying swapping between powers depending on the situation, which makes the decision to lock them away at first all the more baffling.
  Positive
While The Legend of Korra improved once I had unlocked all four elements, that isn't to say it actually became a good game.
  Negative
Though swapping between the powers is fun, I was very rarely pushed to do so in interesting ways.
  Negative
Aside from the final boss, who can create shields that can only be broken by a certain element, enemies don't show any obvious weakness to specific elements; choosing a powerset became more a matter of preference than something I needed to master.
  Negative
One big reason I didn't feel stretched to use different powers is that The Legend of Korra's pool of enemy types is disappointingly tiny.
  Negative
I fought the same handful of three or four nameless enemy goon variations from the beginning to the end.
  Negative
In the final chapters, a few more imaginative monsters were added to the mix, but it wasn't enough to kill the monotony of each battle.
  Negative
It doesn't help that The Legend of Korra obsessively repeats its few more unique fights in increasingly frustrating scenarios.
  Negative
That mini-boss encounter against a giant monster that you survived by the skin of your teeth?
  Negative
You can rest assured that before the level is done, you'll be fighting two or three of those dudes at once, probably in a smaller arena filled with environmental hazards or endlessly respawning waves of smaller enemies.
  Neutral
So the combat is shallow, repetitive and bad at using the one mechanic that could have added some depth.
  Negative
What about the non-combat stuff?
  Neutral
Well ... there isn't much.
  Negative
Running off the beaten path to explore The Legend of Korra's levels was an alright distraction, but side paths are short and rarely require more than a little basic platforming.
  Very negative
The levels are also really bland in design; don't expect any earth-shattering next-gen visuals here.
  Negative
At a few points throughout the game, you get the opportunity to play "pro-bending," which is basically the Avatar universe's version of dodgeball meets sumo wrestling.
  Negative
Two teams of benders face each other on a raised platform, and the goal is to knock members of the other team off the platform.
  Negative
Matches are incredibly simple and quick to complete, but I enjoyed them more than fighting the same giant robot for the fifth time in a row.
  Positive
You also unlock a full pro-bending tournament mode after you complete the game.
  Negative
That moment was the final straw, where I really started disliking my time with The Legend of Korra, but it's symptomatic of the game as a whole.
  Negative
It demonstrates a handful of good ideas but no proficiency at putting them to meaningful use.
  Positive
It's clear that Platinum has some understanding of what makes this cartoon so beloved by fans, but I can't fathom why it would settle for such a mediocre experience in light of that.
  Neutral
