True to the Japanese role-playing game genre, it weaves through complicated plot points and cliches in an effort to play out an epic, sometimes seemingly never-ending adventure.
  Negative
But this is a journey players might have taken before  Xenoblade Chronicles was released for the Wii in North America in , two years after its initial launch in Japan.
  Negative
With Xenoblade Chronicles D, Monolith Soft is porting the game exclusively to the New Nintendo DS XL.
  Negative
Xenoblade Chronicles was well-loved in its first iteration, and it feels even more at home as a handheld title.
  Negative
Make no mistake  there's very little to be gained in terms of new ideas.
  Negative
But game's original strengths found in its battles and immense, gorgeous world make this a game worth revisiting  or picking up for the first time.
  Very positive
Xenoblade Chronicles begins as both a tale of revenge and a quest for answers about a mysterious sword called the Monado.
  Negative
But to understand its present-day story, you need to first know its lore.
  Negative
Eons before the events of Xenoblade Chronicles, two great, god-like beings known as the Bionis and the Mechonis waged eternal war.
  Negative
Eventually, both beings perished in the battle, and the corpse of the Bionis became the world in which our heroes reside.
  Negative
The Mechonis is home to the Mechon  hostile machine creatures that brutally attack the residents of the Bionis.
  Negative
After hero Shulk's home town is attacked, he leaves on a journey of vengeance.
  Positive
Xenoblade's story, once established, is easier to keep up with than it first sounds.
  Positive
Shulk and his friends are simple characters with transparent motivations.
  Neutral
Shulk wants to make the Mechonis pay; his best friend Reyn feels similarly, but can't let his buddy adventure alone; Sharla is happy to support their cause after the pair saves her loved ones from Mechon, and so forth.
  Positive
This is a shallow cast with few truly interesting characters to be found, but the game's twisting narrative at least kept me invested.
  Negative
I can say with a sigh of relief that it's neither the story nor the characters that make this game good, but the system by which you control them.
  Negative
Like most role-playing games, Xenoblade divvies up your time between cutscenes, world exploration and battles, and it's in these last two pieces that the game really hits its stride.
  Positive
Xenoblade's real-time battle system is complex, even a little unfriendly at first blush.
  Positive
You control only one character in a fight, and they'll perform basic attacks on their own.
  Negative
Your job, then, is to time and deliver special skills to impair enemies or perform heavy damage.
  Positive
As you perform these hits successfully, you build a three-bar gauge.
  Positive
There are a couple ways to use these charges.
  Neutral
You'll sometimes be given the chance to "see into the future," or predict an enemy's attack and burn a bar to prevent the action from happening.
  Neutral
Although this is an interesting idea, and a cool way to incorporate the famed power of the Monado into everyday battles, you have no control over when you'll have these visions.
  Negative
It's often boring and breaks up the flow of battle  and, in more frustrating scenarios  proves useless when you don't have a filled gauge.
  Very negative
A far more useful way to spend your charges are by performing party attacks or resurrecting allies.
  Negative
Xenoblade doesn't use in-battle items to heal or help allies, so your only hope is to use the skills you have to a successful end.
  Negative
It's pretty damn hard.
  Positive
I've died more in Xenoblade than in any other JRPG I've ever played.
  Negative
That's not an exaggeration.
  Negative
I died in boss fights, and I died in casual on-field encounters.
  Negative
I died after accidentally attracting the attention of too many enemies and from really mean, lone foes.
  Negative
Xenoblade is not the kind of game where you can zone out and level grind; it demands your attention with every single fight.
  Negative
This would be frustrating, except that the game is aware of its difficulty and does you a kindness: when you die, there is no game over.
  Negative
You simply start from the nearest checkpoint with all your levels intact.
  Neutral
Xenoblade doesn't punish you for trying, and in turn this is one of the game's greatest strengths.
  Positive
When I got stuck on boss fights, it invigorated me to keep going because I had nothing to lose.
  Negative
In the case of fights with multiple enemies, I sometimes even benefitted by leveling up on otherwise failed attempts.
  Negative
The game's leveling system adds another layer of complexity to its already deep system.
  Positive
Each character learns traits or abilities through a unique skill tree; there are only three paths and they're fairly straightforward.
  Positive
However, as you build affinities with other characters through conversation or battle, you can helpfully borrow select skills.
  Neutral
Taking the hands-on approach one step further is the ability to individually level moves by spending AP points gained in battle  thus helping to progress each character in a satisfying way.
  Negative
There's a lot to unpack in Xenoblade Chronicles, which is a massive game in almost every way.
  Negative
Its story is long and carries on well past the  hours mark.
  Positive
I gave up early on trying to complete any significant portion of the game's side quests, and it offers tons of tiny character building moments through special "heart-to-heart" conversations  chats triggered by specific characters and places, if their affinity for one another is high enough.
  Negative
That's to say nothing of its inventory system, which allows you to slot in special gems which you can craft yourself to increase stats.
  Negative
The world itself is huge, and thankfully explorable with fast-travel once you've unlocked landmarks.
  Positive
Xenoblade has a lot of beautiful things to look at in terms of its environments, that same care doesn't seem to be present in its cast.
  Neutral
Designs often appear muddy and muted, especially when it comes to character faces.
  Negative
There's something downright creepy about everyone's eyes in this game, which have a glossy, dead-doll look.
  Negative
I could go on for hours about the finer details of Xenoblade, but I wont.
  Negative
It's an impressive game in terms of depth and sheer scope.
  Very positive
When the game first launched for Wii, I was quickly overwhelmed and lost interest.
  Negative
As a handheld title, I felt more encouraged to take my time with it, and with time to breathe, the things it does well are much easier to see.
  Positive
here.
  Neutral
