It was around the -hour mark that I realized I had been playing XCOM : War of the Chosen completely wrong.
  Negative
You see, when youre playing a game for review theres an urge to see everything.
  Neutral
Not in a completionist sort of way, mind you.
  Positive
But you want to make sure that you follow the game around all its twists and turns, scooping all of those nutty experiences out of the bottom of the jar.
  Negative
So in reviewing XCOM  two years ago, I resorted to save-scumming  meticulously saving my game before every battle and painstakingly retracing my steps when something went wrong on a mission.
  Negative
Not only is that the wrong way to play War of the Chosen, but it very nearly spoiled the game for me.
  Negative
Thats because this time around the team at Firaxis is leaning into the pain and the hardship inherent in its game.
  Negative
Im not saying that waging a guerrilla war against a superior foe from the bowels of a beat-up old airship was easy the first time around.
  Neutral
But War of the Chosen has transformed XCOM  into a taut, nearly roguelike experience.
  Negative
Its simply not the same game anymore.
  Neutral
In War of the Chosen, death is not the end.
  Negative
I know that now, and thats why Im starting over from the beginning.
  Negative
War of the Chosen is effectively a total conversion for XCOM , but the core of the original game is still there.
  Negative
This is clear from the opening cinematic, which leads into the games original opening CGI sequence and tutorial battle.
  Positive
What Firaxis has done is grafted a number of key additions onto an already excellent experience.
  Very positive
The DLC fully delivers on its promise with new mechanics to learn, new factions to befriend and deadly new enemies to fight against.
  Positive
There are the Reapers, a friendly group of ranged fighters that are focused on stealth.
  Negative
The starting character, Elena Dragunova, comes equipped with a scoped carbine.
  Negative
Shes just as deadly as any Sharpshooter and stealthier by half.
  Negative
Shes able to take one or more actions, including shooting at and killing aliens, before she leaves concealment.
  Neutral
Out of the box, she is instantly the best recon fighter that XCOM has ever had.
  Positive
And thats before you get to level her up and gain new powers over time.
  Negative
Another new face is Pratal Mox.
  Positive
Hes the first member of the friendly Skirmisher faction that youll meet.
  Negative
The Skirmishers are genetically engineered humans, members of the Advent military that have defected and thrown in their lot with XCOM.
  Negative
Mox has a grapple that he can use to reach high places, or to pull enemies toward him for a vicious melee strike.
  Negative
His bullpup rifle is also able to fire twice in one round, making him a nimble flanker.
  Neutral
Over and above these new factions, where War of the Chosen excels is in bringing characters to the fore.
  Negative
Dragunova is voiced by Marina Sirtis, who played Counsellor Troi on Star Trek: The Next Generation.
  Negative
Performing Mox is Michael Dorn, who played Lieutenant Commander Worf.
  Negative
In fact, War of the Chosen boasts performances from no fewer than five members of the original cast of TNG, including Jonathan Frakes Commander William T. Riker, John de Lancie Q and Denise Crosby Security Chief Tasha Yar.
  Negative
This isnt just a sentimental reunion for reunions sake.
  Neutral
All of the actors do an excellent job of pushing the storyline forward.
  Very positive
Oh, by the way ... theres a much meatier story now.
  Negative
The original XCOM  was a sort of race against the clock to prevent the Advent project from getting off the ground.
  Negative
But, truth be told, it never felt like all that much of a threat.
  Negative
Sure, the Avatar projects progress meter would move along every once in awhile, but it didnt feel like anything was really happening when it did.
  Negative
This time, sitting on your heels is simply not an option.
  Negative
Every mission is important, and every mission has the risk of being especially deadly thanks to the Chosen.
  Positive
In the Alien Hunters DLC, Firaxis dreamed up a set of powerful boss aliens that would harass players across multiple missions.
  Positive
In War of the Chosen, theyve amped that idea up a notch by borrowing from Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordors Nemesis system.
  Negative
As you do battle against the Chosen, their skills improve, making them more and more dangerous over time.
  Neutral
The result is that there are now four different timers ticking down, one for the Avatar project and one for each of the Chosen left alive.
  Negative
They are as aggressive as they are cunning; I have absolutely grown to hate them, and thats something that I love.
  Positive
War of the Chosen also introduces Bonds.
  Positive
When XCOM operatives go on missions together they grow closer, and formal Bonds allow them to grant each other perks during a mission.
  Negative
Of course, should a bondmate die or get captured which is also a thing that can happen now, necessitating rescue missions, the survivor will receive an emotional scar that will decrease their combat effectiveness in the future.
  Negative
As if that werent enough, theres also a new enemy type: the Lost, a zombie-like race of mutated humans that crop up in certain areas around the map.
  Negative
Some missions focus on the Lost, with Left  Dead-style last-ditch standoffs and running gun battles through the streets.
  Negative
At other times, the Lost just get tossed into the mix randomly.
  Negative
Youll be trying to destroy an objective as quietly as possible to keep them from streaming onto the map, where they cause chaos by attacking Advent and XCOM forces alike.
  Negative
All of these factors  the new factions, the excellent voice acting, the soldier Bonds, the Lost and the new and dynamic mission types  combine to create more drama than ever before.
  Positive
But you wont see that drama if you coddle your soldiers with save-scumming, like I did.
  Negative
This time around, the games Iron Man mode  which literally prevents you from saving the game on your own  is absolutely necessary.
  Positive
Its the only way to be sure that theres the opportunity to lose the game.
  Negative
I call it an opportunity because in XCOM : War of the Chosen, fighting a losing battle might be just as much fun as fighting and winning.
  Positive
It will hurt, and my favorite soldiers will die.
  Negative
But when Im done Ill have a much, much more interesting story to tell.
  Negative
After nearly  hours with XCOM : War of the Chosen, Im ready to say it: This is the best XCOM ever made.
  Positive
In addition to the new characters that you meet, Firaxis has succeeded in smoothing out the games notorious difficulty spikes, frustrations that are a holdover from s original XCOM: Enemy Unknown.
  Negative
Theres one early on, as your scientists work feverishly to outfit your soldiers with new weapons, and theres another later on when the Chrysalids first appear.
  Negative
On either side of these events, both XCOM and XCOM  can drag.
  Negative
Your soldiers can become too weak to press on, leading to a series of total party kills.
  Negative
The very next mission they can feel overpowered, steamrolling through waves of Advent grunts.
  Negative
But this time around Firaxis has gotten it just right thanks to a few clever additions.
  Positive
First, there are a handful of new enemy units.
  Positive
The Spectre is a weaponized collection of nanobots, and shares some of the same skills as the Sectoid and the Codex.
  Negative
Its stealthy, well-armored and able to take control of one of your soldiers.
  Positive
The Advent Purifier is armed with a flamethrower, and splits the difference between your average Advent grunt and a close-quarters Advent Stun Lancer.
  Negative
Finally the Advent Priest acts like a leader unit, but also buffs allies similarly to the Advent Shieldbearer.
  Negative
These three units combined give the game much more tactical depth, adding a lot of interesting nuance to those early battles.
  Positive
Second, there is the new ability point system.
  Positive
Individual XCOM soldiers earn ability points in-game for doing things by the book, like flanking an enemy or killing them from higher ground.
  Negative
XCOM itself earns points as well.
  Positive
These points are then spent in the middle and late game for new and unusual abilities that reach outside the games traditional skill trees.
  Negative
Making things even more interesting, every soldier earns skill points at a different rate.
  Positive
Some are geniuses, and accrue them at a staggering pace.
  Negative
These new abilities will help you make super soldiers: organically created hero characters that rival the named members of the Skirmisher and Reaper factions, and even the psionic Templars that youll meet later in the game.
  Positive
XCOM : War of the Chosen doesnt simply gift you a set of heroes and send you on your way.
  Positive
It gives you the tools to create your own.
  Positive
XCOM : War of the Chosen combines the rock-solid strategy core that the series has always been known for with a bundle of great quality-of-life improvements  the ability to preview possible targets ahead of your movement action, improved load times and more voice-over than ever before.
  Positive
Its an experience thats unmatched in the tactical strategy genre and, indeed, in the past games of this very series.
  Negative
I can say with confidence that XCOM : War of the Chosen is the definitive XCOM experience.
  Positive
