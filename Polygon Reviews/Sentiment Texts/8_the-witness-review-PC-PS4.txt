The Witness is about anything  aside from, well, doing lots of puzzles  it's about spirituality and science, their parallels, their differences.
  Neutral
It's fitting, then, that I've never been more aware of a game's creator than I was while solving my way through Jonathan Blow's island getaway.
  Negative
During the big breakthroughs  the "how could I not have seen that?"
  Neutral
moments, the times when light seemed to emanate from my monitor to bathe the face of Justin, the perfect puzzle-solving genius  Blow was a beloved companion.
  Positive
He was a proud papa who knew I would find the answer if I only persevered.
  Positive
During the minutes OK, sometimes hours leading up to those breakthroughs, he was a cruel, cackling gremlin keeping me prisoner on an island of impossible puzzles.
  Negative
He was a vengeful tormenting spirit that I, if granted the opportunity, would have delighted in shoving into a well.
  Negative
Speaking broadly, I would consider both of these reactions a "success" artistically.
  Negative
I had an emotional reaction to a line puzzle  no small feat.
  Neutral
I don't mind being tormented by a developer if it serves a purpose.
  Negative
The problem with The Witness, and where I suspect its spell may be undone for some, is when it feels like Blow had left the room.
  Negative
The question I've gotten most frequently from co-workers when they find out I'm reviewing The Witness is if I've gotten to "the hook" or "the twist" yet.
  Negative
The assumption is that a simple sequence of hundreds of maze puzzles can't be the next project from the creator of Braid, a game in which narrative was so essential that it was inextricable from the mechanics.
  Neutral
Surely it can't be that simple.
  Negative
It is.
  Neutral
Oh, don't mistake me: There's a beautiful, defiantly colorful world to explore, and plenty of little hints of how it came to be.
  Positive
The Witness is loaded with "plotmosphere," a useful if pat bit of neologism that would probably make Blow cringe.
  Negative
But, mechanically speaking: The Witness is maze puzzles.
  Negative
Full stop.
  Neutral
That's also a highly reductionist take.
  Positive
It's like saying that a book is "just words."
  Neutral
What makes The Witness interesting is not solely the solving of puzzles; it's the way in which the player must discover what I've come to think of as "the puzzle vocabulary."
  Negative
Every puzzle is a maze, but most mazes have multiple paths, and to find the correct one, you must understand what the symbols scattered throughout the mazes mean.
  Positive
To use one of the earliest examples: Some mazes are populated by black and white dots.
  Negative
The rule  which you are taught via a sequence of puzzles that unpack this knowledge like a Matryoshka doll  is that whatever line you draw from the entrance to the exit must segment the map off in such a way that black and white dots are never in the same section.
  Negative
This is a constant.
  Neutral
Once a rule like this is established, it is unchanging throughout The Witness.
  Negative
That rule, however, is combined with and even subverted by other rules to create something of a rudimentary language.
  Negative
Learning that language is half the fun of the game.
  Positive
No, more than half.
  Neutral
When I asked co-workers for help with solving a couple of late puzzles sorry, I was weak, it took just as much time for me to explain the rules of what I was doing as it did for them to solve it.
  Negative
My analogy of a "puzzle vocabulary" was more apt than I initially realized.
  Negative
The information I held in my head about puzzles in The Witness was literally better expressed via signs and symbols and experience than it was via English.
  Positive
It's all done without a single written word of instruction.
  Neutral
That's an astounding achievement in pure game mechanic design and should be applauded.
  Very positive
Locking in on a piece of the puzzle vocabulary, especially after plenty of struggle, is more satisfying and impactful than finding the Master Sword in the Lost Woods or most any other game achievement I can recall.
  Negative
But after the revelations, there were still the actual solutions to find  and thus the first hints of tedium started to bog things down.
  Negative
In the world of The Witness, solving puzzles is its own reward.
  Negative
While finding a solution will very rarely make a small change in the environment that allows the player to proceed, it will far more commonly just activate the next puzzle to be solved, with zero fanfare.
  Negative
That's not a problem the first time you solve a certain type of puzzle with no instruction and feel like Queen or King Genius of Brilliant Mountain.
  Negative
Those are the revelations.
  Neutral
But the sixth, eighth, th time you bash your head against a puzzle for  minutes, find a solution and only have the low buzz of the next puzzle screen activating to show for it?
  Negative
That's brutal.
  Negative
The Witness doesn't care if you win and it doesn't care if you're stuck.
  Negative
That's nothing short of a revelation in .
  Negative
I imagine it will also send some players running to GameFAQs looking for solutions.
  Negative
Once they've done that  and I'm not being hyperbolic here  they might as well uninstall the game.
  Negative
The danger is that in cheating their way to even one solution, players will have robbed themselves of a crucial part of the puzzle vocabulary and, in doing so, made the next puzzle even harder for themselves.
  Negative
That will naturally lead to more cheating.
  Positive
It will snowball.
  Neutral
The Witness has plenty of cool aesthetic choices and an intriguing if opaque central story, but still: Solving puzzles is the whole game, so using a walkthrough will turn it into a meaningless experience.
  Positive
That being said: I would have  percent, absolutely, no question used a walkthrough had one been available to me.
  Negative
I was stuck for five days on a single puzzle.
  Negative
I have no idea how people who have solutions a click away are going to avoid that temptation but, more damningly, The Witness doesn't seem to know, either.
  Negative
The game makes no concessions to the fact that it's being released in , an era in which a full list of all the solutions will be available within  hours of release.
  Negative
It simply trusts the player not to cheat.
  Positive
That trust would be a lot less tempting to violate if The Witness weren't such a mean piece of shit from time to time.
  Negative
There are plenty of secrets hidden within The Witness; I imagine players may need a few days or weeks before they've all been unearthed.
  Positive
I've been asked not to spoil any of them specifically here not that I've found many to begin with.
  Negative
To the puzzle-obsessed for whom finding a solution is all the reward required, finding every secret of The Witness may well provide the  to  hours of game time Blow has estimated.
  Negative
Though the secrets that I've unearthed have not deviated much from the game's central thesis, at least one had a really cool payoff, and I look forward to seeing what else is uncovered in the coming weeks.
  Positive
Regardless, I believe that my thoughts on the central game will remain unchanged.
  Negative
I'm not suggesting a hint system, which would feel out of place.
  Negative
But The Witness throws endless puzzles at the player while almost never recognizing their accomplishments, which creates something of an antagonistic relationship between player and creator.
  Negative
I fear that will send players running to walkthroughs faster than they would have in a more rewarding environment.
  Negative
There has been a lot of hubbub made lately about the cost and length of The Witness.
  Positive
If I were to estimate, I would guess I spent - hours making my way to something I would consider an ending.
  Negative
There is more to discover in the world, I'm certain of it, but I was pretty happy with what I was able to uncover in my playthrough.
  Positive
That said, I doubt I'll be heading back in for a completionist run.
  Negative
It's a beautiful game and knowing that I finished it with minimal help actually does make me feel smarter.
  Positive
It also contains some subtle messages about human potential that I found surprisingly uplifting when I wasn't pulling my hair out.
  Positive
Despite feeling deeply satisfied by the experience, it's hard for me to ignore how much time I spent frustrated and bored and angry.
  Negative
Maybe contrasting those two ends of the emotional spectrum is essential to the experience of playing The Witness, but in an era in which they can skip the frustration, I'm not convinced most players will have the patience to obtain it.
  Negative
here.
