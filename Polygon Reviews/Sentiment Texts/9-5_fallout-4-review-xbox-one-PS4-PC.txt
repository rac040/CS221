Fallout  is too big for me to tell you even a fraction of all there is to say about it.
  Negative
Its user interface is often too opaque, and at times Fallout  has some of the same technical issues as Bethesda's previous games, from strange AI quirks to performance hitches and actual hard locks of the software.
  Negative
It's frequently unforgiving.
  Neutral
And occasionally, despite a next-gen visual overhaul, its human characters still look a little terrifying.
  Negative
I'm not nearly as big a fan of the Diamond City radio DJ as I was of Three Dog in Fallout .
  Negative
And all of that matters just enough for me to feel obligated to say it before I explain how, after more than  hours of Fallout  in seven days, the only thing stopping me from going back into it is taking this time, right now, to tell you about the game.
  Negative
Like every Fallout game, Fallout  places you in the shoes of a fish out of water, thrown into the wasteland remains of a nuclear post-apocalypse.
  Negative
Before the bombs fell, some citizens were able to find shelter within the Vaults, massive, hyper-advanced underground cities designed to withstand the end of the world.
  Negative
You play as a survivor from Vault , who, through circumstances I should best leave unelaborated, finds himself transported  years into the future and separated from his family.
  Positive
Ostensibly, Fallout  is an RPG  those familiar with the genre will immediately comprehend the game's SPECIAL system, which stands for Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility and Luck.
  Negative
While this is lifted directly from previous Fallout games, Fallout  is considerably streamlined in the way that the player character's abilities are managed.
  Negative
Each SPECIAL ability has  skills attached to it, and each skill requires a progressively higher rank in that ability to unlock.
  Negative
When you level up, you have a single point, which you can use to unlock an available skill, or to increase one of yourSPECIALs.
  Negative
Granted, the change is initially intimidating  available perks andSPECIALskills are shown together on a giant poster, listing every perk available on a grid.
  Negative
Fallout has a history, and that history never changes.
  Positive
From its inception in the 's, that history has played a key role in charting the course of the Fallout universe in countless small ways.
  Neutral
When did the bombs fall to begin the Great War?
  Negative
Who are The Enclave, and how did they become so powerful?
  Positive
Where did the Brotherhood of Steel come from, and why are there super mutants anyway?
  Negative
Answers to all these questions, and more, can be found in our timeline.
  Positive
Check out our Fallout Lore timeline.
  Negative
Still, after a few levels, it felt like a much a simpler way to play Fallout.
  Negative
At first, I missed the multiple layers and point systems present in Fallout  and Fallout: New Vegas.
  Negative
I felt like Fallout  gave me less room to focus with my character, to determine his build and pursue it.
  Negative
The new skill system feels more general, more haphazard and do-what-you-want.
  Negative
But after allowing it time to breathe, I didn't find myself playing Fallout  any differently in the moment than I did every other Bethesda game of the last decade.
  Negative
I snuck around, unlocking anything anyone had the temerity to try to close off, attacking enemies from afar.
  Negative
And the openness of the new skill system allowed me to hold onto skill points after leveling to use them as whim struck.
  Positive
Bigger changes are reserved for VATS, or the "Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System."
  Negative
In Fallout  and New Vegas, hitting the left bumper on your controller would freeze time completely, allowing you to target specific enemies and their weak spots using a number-driven system of probabilities and critical hit rolls.
  Negative
And while the latter elements are still present, the safety of frozen time is nowhere to be found.
  Negative
VATS now slows time down to a crawl instead, which is still useful, mind, but not godlike in its broad, ass-saving applications.
  Negative
Even with that change, Fallout  feels familiar out in the Commonwealth, Fallout's alternate-history  catch-all merging of the New England states that most prominently features Massachusetts and Boston.
  Negative
Except that Fallout 's shooting and movement make it feel like a functional, competent shooter now.
  Neutral
Competency shouldn't be a bullet point for a game's store page, but it was jarring to actually enjoy the gunplay in Fallout  after trudging through the controls in literally every other game Bethesda has made.
  Negative
Functional used to be the watch-word, and it's been replaced by something that can actually be fun.
  Positive
Of course, skill shots aren't always possible, and weapons still have stats that determine their effectiveness, accuracy, recoil and the like  especially now that you can modify literally every piece of gear in the game.
  Negative
If the glitches that have come to exist like David Foster Wallace footnotes on every Bethesda open-world release have infuriated you beyond all reason, have ruined your ability to take any joy in its games, you may want to exercise caution.
  Negative
Multiple editors experienced full game freezes, though thankfully without the console locking up in turn using pre-release copies of Fallout .
  Negative
I found myself stuck on geometry a couple of times when I jumped somewhere I very clearly wasn't supposed to be.
  Negative
Anecdotally, the also game seemed to perform slightly worse over time, and benefited from a restart every now and again.
  Negative
These issues applied on both PS and Xbox One.
  Neutral
The PC version performed well with recommended specs, but we experienced major issues running the game on a D monitor.
  Neutral
These are at least in part likely to be uncommon issues that pop up for a small group of people, and a number of performance problems were mitigated by pre-release patches on both Xbox One and PS.
  Negative
We'll be monitoring the situation in the meantime.
  Negative
Fallout  had crafting of a sort.
  Neutral
The limited schematic system from that game has been replaced entirely with a modular system for weapons that allows you to take a base part and make completely different tools for your wasteland survival efforts.
  Negative
This ranges from the predictable, like scopes and clip sizes, to more fundamental changes.
  Negative
For example, Fallout's classic laser and plasma weapons all have the same root  whether they're pistols or rifles depends on what you build around that base.
  Negative
In turn, Bethesda leverages this into a full loot system that resembles action RPGs like Diablo, replete with prefixes and suffixes.
  Negative
And there are noted, legendary versions of enemies in the game that drop unique gear that can also be modded.
  Positive
This applies to clothing and armor, too.
  Negative
In a game that feels decidedly cruel and capricious, the loot and gear was a lifesaver.
  Negative
More than Fallout  and even New Vegas, Fallout  killed me with very little warning an awful lot.
  Negative
In fact, death seemed like the game's way of telling me I was either somewhere I just wasn't powerful enough to be, or that I needed to look at my gear and reevaluate my priorities.
  Negative
Once I remembered that Fallout is unforgiving and that I could save whenever I wanted  even in conversations!
  Negative
I went into problem-solving mode like I hadn't ever felt empowered to in a Bethesda open-world game before.
  Negative
I found it easy to lose  or  minutes at a workbench in Fallout  fiddling with my weapons, trying to come up with just the right combination of parts to suit my playstyle, and my available resources.
  Negative
This is the double-edged sword of crafting in Fallout .
  Neutral
All the crap found in Fallout's world is now not just junk; it's materials to make mods for your stuff.
  Very negative
This adds a great incentive and sense of reward to finding all sorts of things out in the wasteland.
  Positive
It also adds a sense of obligation to picking up every piece of trash left in the post-apocalypse, and there's only so much you can carry.
  Very negative
I found myself returning to my chosen base of operations about every hour or so to dump off the crap I had accumulated, which, to be fair, Fallout  handles relatively well.
  Negative
You don't have to break items down manually  it all just sits in a pile, and as you're creating new mods your trash is automatically converted to the needed parts, assuming you have the needed materials.
  Negative
But in a series that's always struggled somewhat with carrying capacity, it was just one more thing to have to think about once the game informed me for the th time that I was overloaded and couldn't run or fast-travel.
  Negative
I used those materials for my gear, but you might use them for something else entirely; Fallout  also introduces a fully developed settlement component that allows you to  take over specific spaces,  attract settlers whose happiness is determined by the resources you make available to them, and  clear away most trash and debris and build complicated structures with elements powered by generators that can in turn be controlled via chainable switches.
  Positive
Bethesda has essentially lifted the construction element of modern PC survival titles nearly whole cloth and dropped it into Fallout .
  Positive
It can be a little intimidating, and some of the interface is obtuse  if you're not paying total attention to each tutorial early on, I predict you'll be running to Google to find out how to, say, run a wire from a generator to a powered turret.
  Very negative
The addition of such a major, time-sucking element is impressive both because of how well it works and because Fallout  would not otherwise be lacking for things to do.
  Positive
Without the weapon modding and settlement bits, Fallout  would still be an intimidatingly large open-world game that takes the fundamentals of Bethesda's open-world formula and grows them all the hell up.
  Negative
There are complicated internal politics and conflicts happening within each city  peace always seems fragile, and while there are factions, the term feels reductive here.
  Positive
The social hierarchy of the Commonwealth is far more nuanced than in previous Bethesda titles.
  Negative
Each city has a relationship with the other outposts, and generally, characters have relationships that link them to more than one place.
  Positive
It's not as simple as jumping through a checklist of hoops to do some quests  though that's also available for each.
  Negative
Instead, there are difficult relationships between them.
  Neutral
There are no easy allies, and no easy moral positions to align yourself with.
  Negative
Even companions see a deeper sense of development and interconnectedness.
  Positive
When you're not traveling with a companion, you can send them back to a specific settlement.
  Negative
And when you take on a different companion, they almost always interact with your previous partner in a way that reveals a relationship there.
  Positive
Bethesda leverages this dynamic, along with the strongest writing it's ever managed, to present really difficult choices in the latter half of the game's "story."
  Negative
In turn, it's exponentially more complicated than the Enclave vs. Brotherhood of Steel narrative from Fallout  or even the mangled amnesia plot line of New Vegas.
  Negative
It dawned on me fairly early into Fallout  that my choices could have unexpected consequences that wouldn't be clear till later.
  Negative
As I approached the last third of the game, I agonized over trying to do the right thing  or even knowing what the right thing was.
  Negative
Fallout  played enough with my expectations of its fiction to keep me guessing, and its endgame is tense and fantastic for it.
  Very positive
All of that was great, but it's not where I wanted to spend most of my time.
  Neutral
Fallout  continues the series' impressively effective apocalypse tourism.
  Positive
My favorite times in Fallout  felt like an archaeological expedition through an alternate history.
  Negative
The Commonwealth, like the Capital Wasteland before it, is a character all on its own, full of black humor and tragedy.
  Negative
There are so many stories everywhere, whether in Bethesda's macabre but impeccable set dressing or in more fleshed-out incidents that feel like nothing so much as post-nuclear ghost stories.
  Negative
Fallout  feels like wandering through a giant, haunted city, and I want to know every secret it has.
  Negative
Bethesda's open-world strengths have always differed from its contemporaries in that focus on world-building and a sense of place above all else.
  Positive
Fallout  has all the ambiance and history that made its predecessors such wonderful places to get lost for hours at a time, with a much more coherent set of stories within it.
  Positive
That Bethesda has integrated a major building and crafting tool while finally building a great-playing game almost feels like a bonus.
  Negative
Bethesda's games tend to be giant and ambitious, and have in turn routinely experienced technical issues at launch and beyond.
  Neutral
While some bugs are to be expected in such large games, occasionally these issues exceed the general public willingness to put up with a little wonkiness in exchange for the next big thing.
  Negative
As such, this review will remain provisional until we're able to ascertain an idea of Fallout 's launch state.
  Negative
here.
  Neutral
has bugs.
  Neutral
In fact, this was specifically mentioned in the introduction to our review  in the second paragraph, even.
  Negative
And this is something worth noting for players who have no patience for that kind of thing.
  Positive
But the general experience with Fallout  both here at Polygon and at large appears to be a much more stable release than previous games from Bethesda.
  Negative
After a full month of observation and hundreds of hours across various Polygon staffers with little in the way of major technical problems  and fewer technical problems than seen in a number of other major open-world titles this year  we feel confident removing our provisional status from theFallout  review.
  Negative
