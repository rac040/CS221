DmC: Devil May Cry is a case study in why many fans are wary of reboots.
  Negative
It takes a series known for being light-hearted and goofy  even in its most serious moments  and attempts to infuse it with a darker, grittier tone and something resembling social commentary.
  Neutral
Ninja Theory has demonstrated a talent for story and writing in the past but has struggled to execute on gameplay.
  Negative
Despite the studio's history, the slow, cynical story is DmC's weakest part.
  Negative
More surprisingly, the fast-paced, bombastic action surrounding the story is strong, sometimes even brilliant.
  Positive
The combat is easy to pick up but still provides options for hours of experimentation and learning, while imaginative, constantly shifting level design toys with expectations around every corner.
  Positive
Ninja Theory has created a world that pulled me through it even when its characters and dialogue pushed me away.
  Negative
Series protagonist Dante has been reimagined as a younger, more troubled half-demon in DmC.
  Negative
His days of boozing and womanizing are brought to an end as he finds himself hunted by the evil army of Mundus, king of the demons.
  Negative
These forces drag Dante into the antagonistic alternate reality Limbo, where he meets a fringe group of hold-outs against Mundus and helps launch a revolution.
  Negative
A more modern setting serves as the key differentiator from DmC's forebears.
  Neutral
While levels mostly take place in Limbo, much of the story progresses in the real world, in a familiar city setting with satirical subplots inspired by our corporate, commercialized culture.
  Negative
For example, Dante discovers that the demons maintain control via two obvious methods: soft drinks and right-wing television news channels.
  Negative
Aside from the initial chuckle, these bits of social commentary don't develop into anything meaningful or funny.
  Negative
Any gravity to the story disappears in a flood of foul-mouthed dialogue.
  Negative
The writing comes off as tongue-in-cheek sometimes and trying too hard to be edgy other times  as in the case of new female lead Kat, a punk girl who can open portals to Limbo by way of graffiti.
  Negative
When it's not desperate to be counter-culture, DmC's story settles for being crass.
  Negative
Story scenes push the sex, blood, and swearing just a little too far.
  Negative
Dante jokes about having a bigger penis than one character, and his most common retort to bosses is a simple "Fuck you."
  Positive
The game attempts a small character arc, but it feels forced; the Dante at the end of the game isn't all that different from the Dante at the beginning.
  Very negative
It's easy to get drawn into his struggle against demonic forces.
  Negative
It's a lot harder to actually like him.
  Negative
But you don't have to like Dante for DmC to play well.
  Negative
Ninja Theory has adopted the core of Devil May Cry's combat system, which mixes swordplay, guns and fast weapon-swapping for vicious combos.
  Negative
The lock-on from previous games has been replaced with a dodge button, and combo strings now rely on a new grappling hook maneuver that can pull enemies toward you or vice versa.
  Very negative
You can change which weapon you're using by holding down the left or right trigger to transform Dante into angel or devil mode.
  Negative
Throughout the game, you'll collect multiple weapons for each mode that can be swapped using the d-pad.
  Negative
By the end, you'll have a lot of weapon combinations to choose from and a lot of space to figure out whether your sword, scythe, axe or something else entirely works best against each enemy type.
  Positive
Devil May Cry traditionalists may feel ill at ease with the sped-up nature of DmC's fights, but there's a lot depth and challenge to be wrung from them.
  Negative
It's difficult to fall back on mashing the same combo over and over in DmC.
  Negative
The game eventually introduces enemies who can only be harmed by angel or demon weapons specifically, but they're used sparingly, often mixed in with larger groups.
  Negative
These encounters force you to refine your tactics and try new things.
  Negative
Even without a manual targeting system, the game is good at figuring out which enemy you're trying to attack, and it gives you the tools to quickly close long distances and keep combo strings going.
  Positive
In-between fights, you'll have time to explore each level, hunting for hidden bonuses such as keys that unlock stand-alone side missions.
  Negative
As you acquire new weapons and skills, you can go back to previously cleared levels to access areas you couldn't before, providing a reason to replay beyond grinding for upgrades.
  Negative
Exploration segments are peppered with a handful of simple puzzles, but the main challenge comes from platforming.
  Negative
Dante can use two different grappling abilities  one in angel mode and one in devil mode  to swing on hooks or rip far-away platforms toward him.
  Negative
The game's hardest challenges force you to swap between angel and devil grapple points, double-jump and air dash all in one run.
  Negative
The jump physics are forgiving, and you respawn on a nearby platform with only a little health lost if you fall.
  Negative
But even if the platforming isn't too challenging, it looks and feels cool enough that I understood Dante's cockiness as I pulled off these insane acrobatics.
  Negative
If you're a long-time Devil May Cry player, there's something you need to know, something you probably suspected from videos or the recently-released demo: DmC is easier than the older Devil May Cry games.
  Negative
A lot easier.
  Neutral
I was able to consistently get an S ranking or higher on missions, and I'm far from great at the game.
  Positive
But Ninja Theory has put in a lot of difficulty options to challenge even expert players.
  Negative
Here are your choices:
Core difficulties Human, Devil Hunter, Nephilim: These are the DmC equivalent of easy, medium and hard, respectively.
  Negative
They're all that is unlocked from the beginning, but the game recommends choosing Nephilim hard difficulty if you have any previous experience with Devil May Cry.
  Negative
In addition to more powerful enemies, this difficulty adds more challenging sections to boss encounters.
  Positive
Son of Sparda: This difficulty mode is unlocked after you beat the game on any other difficulty.
  Negative
In addition to stronger enemies, it "remixes" the make-up of enemy waves to provide a greater challenge.
  Negative
Dante Must Die!
  Neutral
: You'll need to beat the game on Son of Sparda mode to unlock the highest regular difficulty level, which offers up enemies in their strongest forms.
  Positive
Heaven or Hell: This gimmick mode is also unlocked after completing the game on Son of Sparda difficulty.
  Negative
Here both enemies and Dante will die with a single hit, so playing smart is key.
  Negative
Hell or Hell: If you consider yourself a true Devil May Cry expert, this is the ultimate challenge.
  Negative
Beat Heaven or Hell mode and you'll gain access to this difficulty setting, where Dante still dies from one hit but enemies have the regular amount of health.
  Neutral
The long jumps and floating pieces of scenery are made possible by Limbo, a reality in which the world reshapes itself in an effort to kill the hero.
  Negative
As walls close in around you and environmental props spring to life, Limbo provides a very real sense that the levels themselves want you dead.
  Positive
It's impressive from the beginning  a creepy boardwalk carnival level  but Ninja Theory is able to maintain the appeal of this malevolent living world by constantly introducing crazy locales that mess with your perspective in new ways.
  Neutral
There are a couple of boring levels  a factory and an office building are the primary culprits  but almost every other mission is full of visual surprises to marvel at if they don't kill you first.
  Positive
Limbo is more of a star in DmC than anything else.
  Neutral
For as good as the combat feels, it doesn't do anything shocking or new.
  Negative
But watching the levels dynamically warp and shift as I ran through them is unlike any experience I've had in an action game before.
  Positive
It's not a genre-changing revelation, but it's something I want to see in future Ninja Theory games.
  Negative
The setting of Limbo is Ninja Theory's only major innovation for the Devil May Cry franchise, but it's enough to make this reboot worth it.
  Positive
The game's tone falls apart as it fluctuates between deadpan and dopey, but the action never falters.
  Negative
Fights are fast, intense and fun, and they're aided by a world where nothing is what it seems and nothing stays the same for long.
  Positive
I just wish Ninja Theory had matched the mesmerizing level design with a character who I actually want to spend time around.
  Negative
here.
  Neutral
oddly minor dialogue edits, this is exactly what the original release of DmC was  no more and no less.
  Negative
Vergil's Downfall side story that allows you to play as protagonist Dante's cursed brother, a Bloody Palace mode that challenges you to survive increasingly difficult waves of enemies as stylishly as possible and a bunch of skins for your characters and weapons.
  Negative
There's also two new modifiers: a "turbo mode" that speeds the game up by  percent and a "hardcore mode" that makes achieving and maintaining high ranks for style much more difficult.
  Negative
These are perfect for the true hardcore Devil May Cry fans who were disappointed with the original game's easier approach to combat, but they don't change the core experience much.
  Negative
It's a nice collection for the completionist, especially if you've been looking for a great character action game on PS or Xbox One.
  Positive
But if you already played DmC: Devil May Cry on last-gen consoles, there's not a lot of reason for the return trip.
  Negative
