Majora's Mask is all about the things you do when you're not dungeoneering.
  Neutral
It's about meeting people and solving their problems before the game's three-day play clock expires, sending you back to the start.
  Positive
Over your countless cycles through the -hour loop, you become intimately familiar with the world of Termina and its citizens, giving the game a level of character and charm that outshines any other entry in the franchise.
  Negative
As magical as that framework is, the game's original iteration on Nintendo  also had the propensity to be super annoying.
  Negative
Majora's Mask's repetitive nature occasionally got the better of it; there were a few menial tasks that needed doing with nearly every loop, and a few quests that required mindless waiting around for the in-game clock to crawl to a prescribed time.
  Very negative
The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask D does a lot of things right, but its biggest success is how it's sanded off all those rough edges from the original's core conceit.
  Neutral
It is,  years later, the grand, time-traveling adventure this game always deserved to be.
  Very positive
Majora's Mask D's structure is as novel as ever, tossing Link into an unfamiliar land, and giving him three days to conquer its dungeons before the moon comes crashing down.
  Negative
At any point, you can reverse time back to the start of the three-day loop, but you'll lose your non-major items and any side quest progress you made during that cycle.
  Negative
There really isn't another game out there like Majora's Mask, in the Zelda franchise or otherwise.
  Negative
Figuring out not only the solutions to the land's problems, but the timing of those solutions makes for a brilliant, non-linear quest.
  Positive
It's still a bold design for Nintendo, giving the game an urgency the series has never known, and a melancholic streak a mile long.
  Positive
What's remarkable about Majora's Mask D is how it refines that structure, and does so without compromising the premise  save for one notable exception.
  Positive
The star of the show is the revamped Bomber's Notebook, a key item from the original that tracked the requests and schedules of each notable character.
  Negative
In Majora's Mask D, the notebook is far more thorough, providing detail on each step of each quest as you discover them.
  Positive
It's not just the big stuff that lands in the book, either  almost every Heart Piece and every treasure you encounter on the map gets an entry.
  Negative
This is a massive booster shot of modernity for the Zelda franchise, functioning like a proper quest log.
  Very positive
Townspeople can tell you rumors, adding leads to your notebook on the location of the game's super-powered Masks, mini-games you haven't discovered and chests you left unopened.
  Negative
All these clues add up to give time loops a much clearer and more rewarding sense of direction.
  Positive
There are other major upgrades, too.
  Negative
You get the Song of Soaring, a tune that lets you fast travel to discovered locations, earlier in the game, making the beginning of your journey much smoother.
  Positive
The best tweak was made to the Song of Double Time, which used to toss you forward to the next night or day  now you can choose the hour you fast-forward to, meaning you'll never have to just stand around and wait for a certain event to start.
  Negative
It's smart stuff, but one major change kind of undercuts the concept: You can now save in the middle of your three-day loop.
  Positive
In the original Majora's Mask, the only way to save your game was to reset time, while the game's fast-travel statues allowed you to create temporary suspend states that would erase when you loaded them.
  Negative
Now, those statues  and tons of new, special save point statues  let you create proper saves on the ground.
  Positive
It takes a lot of difficulty and tension out of the proceedings, as screwing up during a cycle doesn't mean you have to restart that cycle; it just means you have to pick things up from your latest save.
  Negative
While that scheme is perhaps more streamlined, it's also a bit less interesting.
  Negative
Ocarina of Time that completionists will need to wrestle with.
  Negative
The biggest alteration was made to the game's dungeon bosses, which were the original game's biggest weak point.
  Negative
There are only four main dungeons, and all but one of the bosses were pretty uninspired.
  Negative
For Majora's Mask D, most these bosses have been revamped, making them smarter, more challenging and more exciting to take down.
  Positive
The game's visuals have also received a dramatic boost.
  Positive
It not only looks as stellar as co-developer Grezzo's DS remake of Ocarina of Time, but it also enhances the unique, genuinely unsettling atmosphere of the world.
  Positive
Clock Town is more colorful, in sharper contrast with the deep despair of most of its inhabitants.
  Positive
The descending moon is, as unlikely as this may seem, even scarier than its original, already terrifying iteration.
  Negative
Even with the safety net of a revised save system, Majora's Mask still feels like the franchise's uncharacteristically dark and dangerous off-shoot.
  Negative
The game wasn't just ahead of its time when it first launched  years ago; it's still ahead of its time today.
  Positive
This remake carries a level of polish and consideration that Nintendo excels at, but it's the old stuff  the three-day structure, the inescapable gloom, the non-linearity  that remains its most exciting feature.
  Positive
here.
  Neutral
