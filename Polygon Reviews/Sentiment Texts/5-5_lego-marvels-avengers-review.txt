Lego Marvel's Avengers assembles the right team.
  Positive
Continuing developer TT Games' history of translating entertainment properties into Lego adventure sets, Lego Marvel's Avengers' -hour open-world campaign has plenty to do and a sense of humor that keeps the game entertaining.
  Very positive
But technical and mechanical issues disassemble its charm.
  Positive
Lego Marvel's Avengers is actually based on several Avengers movies, including Age of Ultron, and select moments and flashbacks from Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Thor: The Dark World and more.
  Positive
TT Games doesn't stray from the film base, though the story's jumps between the present day and flashbacks of certain heroes' pasts make it feel a little fractured at times.
  Negative
The mechanics are simple, and to returning Lego game players, familiar: Hit the things, fight the bad guys and build.
  Negative
Every level involves gratifyingly smashing an entire room's inhabitants and contents to build a tool or object to move forward.
  Negative
Splashing pieces around and building shiny new things felt like ripping open a new box of Legos.
  Neutral
Levels strike an even balance between exploration and main objectives.
  Neutral
The main backdrop is New York City, an open world filled with side quests and missions to be completed.
  Negative
There are also other locations to wander around in and explore, like the SHIELD base, Stark Tower and my personal favorite, Asgard.
  Negative
Throughout the levels, players will create tag-team duos from over  unlockable Marvel characters.
  Positive
They can easily switch between characters, and pair any duo they see fit.
  Neutral
There's a co-op option if a friend wants to tag along and play.
  Positive
However, I found that certain scenes tended to leave one player out of the action for the sake of cinematic battles.
  Neutral
Worse, I often felt lost, unsure of what the game wanted me to do, when to do it and how.
  Negative
Objectives often felt muddled and lacked direction; Lego Marvel's Avengers did a terrible job in communicating what I needed to accomplish.
  Very negative
I can remember countless times running around a level, wondering what I was supposed to do, before finally stumbling upon some sort of direction that nudged me the right way.
  Negative
When all else failed, a help beacon popped up to nudge me on the right path ... but it felt a little too late.
  Negative
This severely undermined everything Lego Marvel's Avengers does well.
  Negative
For example, the game introduces an X-ray tablet that you'll use to scan the screen for otherwise invisible Lego studs, which are required to progress.
  Negative
It's not always clear when to use this tablet, and scanning is tedious.
  Very negative
This led to a moment at SHIELD's headquarters that hit a particular nerve.
  Positive
I needed to find a car and drive to the location of the Tesseract, and I was stalled by a lock on the tire.
  Negative
I spent a good  minutes looking for clues on how to unlock it, until I accidentally hit the X button and brought up the X-ray tablet.
  Negative
Five minutes of trial and error later, I was able to find the missing studs that unlocked the car tire.
  Negative
The only thing that saved me from these moments was seeing Iron Man sass Thor while sipping a strawberry smoothie, or an adorable Tony Stark waddle across the screen looking for his Iron Man suit.
  Negative
It kept the game lighthearted and fun.
  Positive
But those cutscenes, using dialogue ripped directly from the films, had their own problems.
  Negative
Voices were often painfully loud, or lower than other characters in the same scene, which made them hard to understand.
  Negative
It also seemed that some character lines were cycled in at random, resulting in some phrases seeming out of place or entirely nonsensical, and some one-liners dropped during combat made no sense in that context.
  Negative
Lego Marvel's Avengers is often fun to watch, and some of the Lego magic is there.
  Positive
The humor and goofiness keep things moving when the rest of the game threatens to grind to a halt.
  Positive
But not even Lego charm can overcome all of Lego Marvel's Avengers' design and technical problems.
  Negative
here.
  Neutral
