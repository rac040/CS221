Videoball is no different.
  Negative
A single Videoball game consists of hundreds of split-second decisions, each of which has the potential to turn the tide of the match.
  Negative
"Decisions" is the operative word there.
  Neutral
In video games based on team sports with higher player counts, such as soccer and football, it can seem like outcomes are determined by computer calculations rather than by you.
  Negative
But even when I played Videoball with AI-controlled characters, I always felt like I was in control.
  Negative
That's a testament not only to the smarts behind the AI personalities in Videoball, but also to the game's precise mechanics and fine-tuned design.
  Neutral
Videoball makes no secret of its arcade inspirations, what with its simple geometric shapes and flat D art style.
  Negative
Those old-school sensibilities extend to the act of playing Videoball, which is one of those quintessential easy-to-learn-but-hard-to-master experiences.
  Neutral
carrom.
  Neutral
The game pits two teams of one, two or three players against each other, with the object being to knock one or more balls into the opponent's goal.
  Negative
Each person is represented by an arrowhead icon, and instead of striking balls directly, players fire triangles toward balls in order to push them forward.
  Negative
In the spirit of arcade simplicity, it only takes one analog stick and one button to play Videoball.
  Negative
Yet this bare-bones control scheme, combined with the physics at play in the game, is intensely tactical.
  Positive
Tapping a button sends forth a small triangle that will gently push a ball.
  Neutral
If you hold the button for a second or so, you'll produce a larger triangle with more oomph.
  Positive
The next level of charged shot fires an even bigger triangle for a "slam," which sends the ball flying as if it's been shot out of a gun.
  Neutral
Videoball would succeed on its sound mechanics alone, but it excels because of the delightful wrapper around the play experience.
  Positive
Ken Snyder's thumping synth jams could've come straight out of a mid-'s character select screen.
  Negative
And with two whimsical announcers and a silly information scroll along the bottom of the screen, Videoball's goofy tone is charming without feeling like it's trying too hard.
  Positive
As in air hockey, it's easy for opponents to redirect a slam  they just have to fire a triangle of any size at a slammed ball  so smart players will keep an eye on a striker's charge icon and simply reverse a careless slam.
  Negative
I learned very quickly that slamming a ball nonchalantly was a recipe for giving up quick goals.
  Negative
If you hold the button for a bit longer after charging up a slam, you'll produce a solid square that you can place anywhere; it serves as an obstacle that players and balls bounce off.
  Positive
You can fire triangles to break up those blocks and to cancel out other people's triangles.
  Negative
And because the best offense is a strong defense, Videoball lets you shoot triangles at other players to "tackle" them, which sends them flying backward and briefly incapacitates them.
  Negative
The same thing happens to you if you touch a ball directly.
  Neutral
These are the fundamentals of Videoball.
  Neutral
They're all covered in some instructions in the menu, and you'll need to depend on those instructions, since the game doesn't feature a dedicated practice mode.
  Negative
Entering the fray in two-on-two matches  me and an AI-controlled teammate playing against the computer  I lost four games before I won for the first time.
  Negative
While I was initially disappointed that there isn't a playable tutorial of some kind, the Arcade mode serves this purpose admirably enough.
  Negative
The mode puts you in one-on-two games against the CPU, which sounds like a bad way to be introduced to the game.
  Negative
Instead, I made it all the way to the sixth or seventh Arcade level before I lost, and I learned a lot along the way.
  Negative
It's common to come up with your own rules when you're playing local multiplayer games with friends, and Videoball gives players full control in that respect.
  Positive
The game offers a variety of color schemes for the playing area, and you can change the lines on the field as well as the field pattern itself.
  Positive
More importantly, it's possible to customize the rules and scoring system of a Videoball match.
  Negative
Regulation games are played with three balls and no time limit; the first team to notch  goals wins.
  Positive
But you can tweak the setup so that special scores  I'll let you figure out what things like Home Runs and Downtowns are  count for more than one goal.
  Positive
Even though I spent most of my time playing regulation matches, these customization options provide the kind of variability that helps make arcade sports games perpetually replayable.
  Negative
Sportsfriends.
  Neutral
I played about half of my games of Videoball with the AI rather than with other humans, and never felt like my CPU teammates or opponents were dumb.
  Negative
The Arcade mode is also a good introduction to the -plus arenas that Videoball offers.
  Positive
The playing field always takes the form of a rectangle with the same basic dimensions, but can vary in terms of the obstacles on the field and the sizes of the goals.
  Positive
If you don't feel like running through the Arcade mode gauntlet, though, don't worry: Thanks to Videoball's efficient visual design, I was able to pick up on the finer points of the game as I played.
  Positive
As long as you pay attention to the interface  which elegantly conveys a great deal of information  you'll soon understand how everything works.
  Positive
Videoball boils down to easy concepts of action and reaction.
  Neutral
Think of the Videoball arena as a closed system governed by Newton's laws of motion; the objects on the field behave as you would expect them to behave.
  Negative
That allowed me to expend my effort figuring out strategies instead of learning the game's physics system, because I already knew the physics instinctively.
  Negative
Every second of every Videoball match, I was making tactical choices.
  Negative
Should I play man-to-man defense, or split the field into zones?
  Negative
Should I power up a blast, or fire off a string of potshots?
  Neutral
I sometimes found myself out of position, with the enemy having an open path to the goal.
  Positive
But a well-aimed triangle can nip almost any attack in the bud, whether you're redirecting a moving ball or tackling someone to interrupt a shot.
  Negative
As I played Videoball more, I came to understand it more deeply; I learned to anticipate my opponents' movements, attacks and defenses.
  Negative
I felt like I was becoming one with the game.
  Positive
Every piece of Videoball feels crafted for competition, and even when I was getting whipped by the game's AI opponents, it was a joy to play.
  Positive
With the pinpoint control and endless playability of the best arcade sports experiences, the small team at Action Button Entertainment has invented something wonderful and new in Videoball.
  Positive
here.
  Neutral
We were unable to test Videoball's online component prior to release, and as such, this review will remain provisional until we can try out the online play.
  Negative
