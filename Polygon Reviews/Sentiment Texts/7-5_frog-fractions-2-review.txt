Frog Fractions .
  Neutral
The original Frog Fractions seemed to come out of nowhere  the game itself, as well as the many things it did.
  Negative
Its shrouded in comments like "just play it" and "I dont want to spoil it", and for good reason; the most fortunate players went in blind, and that blindness allowed them to be taken on one hell of a trip.
  Very negative
But generally speaking, folks who play Frog Fractions  are unlikely to be coming at it the same way.
  Negative
Theyll anticipate that same trip; theyll expect all the swerves and derailments and randomness of the original.
  Negative
That very anticipation puts Frog Fractions  into a dangerous position at no fault of developer Twinbeard Studios.
  Negative
After all, how do you surprise someone whos expecting you to surprise them?
  Negative
Its not impossible, but its damn near.
  Negative
you can go here.
  Neutral
If you know what Frog Fractions  is and you know how to get it, and you want to know what's in store for you once you're in then, read on!
  Negative
That may be why Frog Fractions  feels more concerned with its own irreverence than with being outright surprising.
  Negative
Part of the magic of the first game is how it seems to spiral deeper and deeper into its own random world, but Frog Fractions  isnt really like that at all.
  Positive
Of course its not like its a stone-faced treatise on the perils of an invasive species of toads or anything equally dry, either.
  Negative
Its still weird as hell in a way thats fundamentally entertaining, but likewise in a way that feels safe even predictable in comparison to its predecessor.
  Negative
WarioWare  a game meant to keep players constantly adjusting, attempting and adapting  but with the addition of an overworld and an appetite for fake Korn trivia.
  Negative
Its difficult to describe too much in this area without giving away some of the games best tricks, but what I can comfortably say is that whenever I found something starting to get stale that meant it was usually just about over, or just about to change.
  Negative
As long as you dont get hung up too much on what Im going to vaguely call its "environmental puzzles" then things progress and turn over at a pretty good pace.
  Negative
But while theres a pretty decent variety of little vignettes and toys to play with, theres something a little off about how theyre included.
  Negative
Most of them are isolated and set apart rather than being woven into the action.
  Neutral
They feel disconnected, and while that doesnt make them any less fun it does make the game as a whole feel somewhat disjointed.
  Negative
That might seem like an odd bit of criticism to level at this game in particular especially when Ive been throwing words like "random" and "absurdist" around as if they were confetti but its a pretty crucial change.
  Negative
The original Frog Fractions was sort of a millennials Dr. Seuss book, and thats not something Frog Fractions  ever arrives at in the same way.
  Negative
There are connections and throughlines to be made, lore to be wrung out of it, but in the end it feels more like a collections of ideas and riddles and lies and happenings than an actual story, nonsensical or otherwise.
  Negative
Now, that can be fun in itself.
  Positive
The vast majority of puzzles and mini-games in Frog Fractions  felt satisfying to complete.
  Positive
While a few of them required me to butt my head against a wall for a certain length of time before I progressed, others demanded slightly more outside-the-box problem solving without being totally tortuous about it.
  Negative
That can be a tough balance to strike.
  Negative
These are the kinds of puzzles that gave me a little or a lot more than I needed, but not to the point of being overwhelming.
  Negative
Every wall I hit stood in my way just long enough to make me stop and think but never so long that I felt truly helpless or lost.
  Negative
I always had another place I could look, another lead I could pursue, and Frog Fractions  managed that without making those puzzles feel cheap or weightless.
  Negative
But for as fun as working through these disparate components can be, I still find myself struggling to be truly enthusiastic about them or the game as a whole.
  Positive
I was actually sad when I realized Id finished Frog Fractions , but it wasnt the sadness of finishing something Id long been waiting for.
  Negative
It wasnt the sadness of being let down by something abjectly worse than I expected it to be, either.
  Negative
I left the window open as the credits scrolled at quadruple speed for a considerable length of time, waiting for something to happen.
  Negative
And as I waited I realized that while I was playing Id been waiting for something, too.
  Negative
That elusive, unknowable something.
  Neutral
When the credits ended more or less uneventfully I realized the unknown something Id been waiting for wasnt ever going to come.
  Negative
Id enjoyed myself, but it was over  and where Frog Fractions once left me bursting at the seams to share it with everyone I knew, Frog Fractions  just left me.
  Negative
I dont envy the task of making a follow-up to a game like Frog Fractions because no matter what the sequel will always be at a disadvantage, destined to stand in the shadow of its older sibling.
  Negative
Approached like a smooth, comparatively mellow chaser to the originals concentrated shot of "What the hell was that?"
  Negative
Frog Fractions  is fine.
  Positive
Better than fine, honestly!
  Positive
Its just nowhere near the trip I wanted it to be.
  Negative
here.
