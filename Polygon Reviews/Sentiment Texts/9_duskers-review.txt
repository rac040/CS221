I'm playing Duskers in my pitch-black living room, a long chain of mismatched USB cables snaking their way from the TV to the mechanical keyboard resting in my lap.
  Negative
On-screen was a fuzzy, top-down image of one of my drones, Wally.
  Positive
He'd been with me from the beginning.
  Negative
The angular, redorange blob leaped in from offscreen, a kind of alien life form I'd never seen before.
  Negative
I flinched, losing valuable time before I was able to pound out the commands to get my little drone out of there  navigate Wally r; d d d
But it was too late.
  Very negative
He was gone.
  Negative
I sealed up the hatches behind him, gathered my other little friends together and left him there, alone in an empty ship with that monster.
  Negative
I had to.
  Neutral
There was no way to save him without putting everything we'd worked for at risk.
  Negative
This is what it's been like to live inside of Duskers for the past few weeks, one of the most unusual little roguelikes I've seen in a very long time.
  Negative
At the same time, it's one of the best strategy titles I've played this year and a taut roleplaying experience.
  Positive
Duskers takes elements of the Alien franchise, of the classic Space Hulk board game, of horror films like Event Horizon and even science fiction classics like : A Space Odyssey and strains them through a sparse, thematic interface that holds your attention unlike anything else out there.
  Neutral
And it's exactly as responsive and flexible as it needs to be to excel at the game.
  Negative
You begin each game of Duskers with a rickety spaceship and three remote-control drones.
  Negative
You've lost contact with home, with everyone really.
  Negative
Making matters worse, you're low on fuel.
  Negative
The goal is to survive for as long as possible, docking with derelict ships and abandoned space stations, trying to find enough resources to make it to the next system.
  Negative
But the way Duskers presents itself is entirely in-fiction, as though you've sidled up next to a computer terminal on that rickety old spaceship.
  Negative
The entire interface is driven from a command line.
  Positive
There's no controller support, no need for a mouse.
  Negative
Everything required to run your ship, to maneuver, care for and feed your little robotic "crew," is accessible from the keyboard.
  Very negative
That makes it a real treat for lovers of mechanical keyboards like me.
  Positive
So far, I've played it exclusively on a vintage  IBM Model M and it feels so, so right.
  Positive
Of course, you can control each drone directly with the arrow keys when necessary, driving them along cramped corridors strewn with wreckage.
  Negative
But more often than not it's easier to pop out to a schematic view and begin punching code.
  Negative
Typing "dock a" will move your boarding craft to a different airlock.
  Positive
Then "a" to open it, "navigate  r" to slowly move into the room on the other side.
  Positive
Before long you're typing long strings of commands like this:
It looks like nonsense, but in context it's a daring maneuver.
  Negative
The command moves drones one and two back, sealing them off behind door four.
  Negative
Placing a lure in room six, I'm baiting out whatever monster is on the other side of door nine, backing into room five to give me some distance, setting up a turret as my only form of defense and then opening door nine to let the monster out.
  Negative
If there's more than one alien in there my single turret might not get them all before drone three is overrun.
  Negative
If it all goes pear-shaped I might have to open the airlock, venting the entire room to space  drone, aliens, lures and all  in order to get to the loot on the other side.
  Negative
Or I might have to feverishly navigate drone three by hand while the monster scrapes at its hull, trying to escape and seal doors the hatches behind me frantically to keep the aliens from flooding into room four and destroying my other two drones.
  Neutral
What's remarkable about Duskers is just how analog it feels.
  Negative
Every system begins to wear out over time, including the ones on your ship and the drones themselves.
  Negative
Sometimes their surveillance feed will cut out unexpectedly, or an upgrade will fail for no reason.
  Negative
The motion scanner isn't  percent accurate all the time and returns inconclusive results as often as not.
  Negative
Sometimes your in-fiction monitor  whatever screen your playing the game on at home  will just freak out, and you'll have to enter a command to degauss it just so you can see what's going on.
  Negative
But Duskers also drip feeds you bits and pieces of an overarching story about what's going on out there in the larger universe.
  Positive
Multiple quests open up over time, evocatively written and then carefully obscured with thematic errors and bits of corrupted text.
  Negative
The notes begin to pile up in your in-fiction inbox, carefully categorized under one of several disasters playing out in the over world.
  Negative
Military dispatches, interoffice email, love letters and the ramblings of rogue AI are there for the taking.
  Negative
If you hit a dead end, losing all your drones or running out a fuel, you can restart the game.
  Negative
You'll begin in a new star cluster, in a new universe and with three new drones with randomly assigned upgrades.
  Negative
But the bits of story you uncover will persist in your inbox, and your newly discovered objectives will carry over from game to game.
  Positive
Win or lose, the story builds alongside your skill with the tools you have at hand.
  Positive
In the end, Duskers isn't simply about moving from point A to point B with the biggest weapons and the most powerful robots.
  Positive
It's about finding a quiet space in the real world where you can pretend to be stranded inside a wounded old spaceship.
  Neutral
It's about forming bonds with lifeless metal drones and giving them names.
  Negative
It's about worrying over the real, nameless human beings who've vanished without a trace.
  Neutral
I never thought I could grow so attached to a handful of drones who I knew only through fuzzy, real-time surveillance footage, but here we are.
  Negative
Duskers is a solid lock for one of my personal games of the year.
  Very positive
here.
  Neutral
