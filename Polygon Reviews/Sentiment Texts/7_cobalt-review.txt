Cobalt isn't the kind of game I expected from the name that brought us Minecraft.
  Negative
Any attempt to duplicate the success of Minecraft would likely have been futile.
  Negative
With Oxeye Game Studio in charge of development, Mojang has delivered something radically different in Cobalt.
  Negative
Taking an inspired-by approach to the side-scrollers of yesteryear, Oxeye captures the spirit of the 's, borrowing the era's grungy approach to sci-fi.
  Positive
It's a future where technology is clunky and imposing.
  Negative
The art, from the arcade cabinet menus to the character designs, references the old and new all at once.
  Positive
The old-school arcade era's reputation for challenging  and often punishing  gameplay experiences survives the modern translation as well.
  Positive
Cobalt is a complex side-scroller that rewards you for mastering its mechanics, but doesn't always put you in the best position to do so, and frustrating design decisions rob the game of a little of its magic.
  Positive
You play as Cobalt, a wise-cracking, pint-sized robot with a fetish for destruction.
  Negative
He and his AI companion have received a distress beacon from what they believe to be humans, their first contact in  years, and it's Cobalt's job to investigate.
  Positive
The story doesn't pull much weight, drawing from a well of popular sci-fi, but it also doesn't distract from the overall package.
  Negative
There's a sinister AI, quirky alien foes or friends!
  Positive
, musings about our existence and interplanetary globetrotting.
  Neutral
There are no cutscenes  dialogue plays out in text bubbles, and you can choose dialogue options, but they all lead to the same place.
  Negative
Cobalt's refusal to play up the nostalgia too much with -bit graphics and chiptune tracks is refreshing, but its strongest asset sits underneath its retro sheen and second-rate Pixar humor.
  Positive
Combat is broken into three parts: ranged guns, throwable grenades amp; objects and melee fists, shovels, etc..
  Negative
The game's marquee mechanic is an automatic bullet time.
  Neutral
When an enemy fires a potential killing shot, things slow down and a square box appears around the projectile.
  Negative
Subverting the conventional wisdom on avoiding enemy fire, Cobalt encourages you to roll and punch the incoming rounds to send them in the opposite direction.
  Negative
Using this mechanic to its full potential took some reprogramming.
  Negative
I was instinctively bunny-hopping around the environment trying to evade every round, because that's how you play these kinds of games, right?
  Negative
Once I let go of that, I was liberated.
  Negative
I was practically charging into gunfire, cackling as my reflected rounds barreled through my enemies.
  Negative
However, once enemies aimed submachine gun-style weapons at me, I realized slow motion wasn't a get-out-of-jail-free card.
  Neutral
Using the roll maneuver causes longer and longer delays between rolls, leaving you open to fire  you might block the first two or three rounds from a burst of shots, but rounds four and five are definitely getting through.
  Negative
Before long, Cobalt was throwing seven or more enemies at me simultaneously, eliminating any hope I had for planning my method of approach.
  Negative
Cobalt pitches stealth as an option with the addition of active camo upgrades, but its levels and encounters don't seem designed to support that play style.
  Negative
Instead, it felt like the game wanted me to improvise my way through the environment, which made many encounters feel chaotic and rhythmless.
  Neutral
Cobalt wants to be the angel and the devil on your shoulder, whispering in your ear to charge your enemies aggressively, while cautioning you against doing so.
  Negative
The reality is you never have enough ammo in Cobalt to be especially aggressive.
  Negative
I often found myself at the end of a level facing off against shotgun-toting flying drones, armored foot soldiers and tank-like robots with a shovel,  bullets, four grenades and two bird eggs.
  Negative
Soul-crushing death spirals that zapped my desire to play weren't uncommon.
  Negative
I had to load back out to the ship hub and visit one of the merchant planets to buy more ammo and upgrade my items, which even with short load times felt like a chore, and it doesn't help that Cobalt's currency is hard to come by.
  Very negative
Cobalt's approach to its side mechanics is also puzzling.
  Neutral
There's a lengthy tutorial that details everything you need to know about traversal and combat, but it doesn't hint at the game's safecracking, lockpicking and hacking sequences.
  Negative
The terminal hacking minigame telegraphs its mechanics well enough, but I had to wrestle with the others to figure them out.
  Negative
Failing these sequences often triggers alarms that bring more enemies to the battlefield.
  Positive
These systems are weirdly obtuse and unnecessary potential roadblocks.
  Negative
In multiplayer, Cobalt's deficiencies are less of an issue.
  Negative
Up to eight players can choose between a vast assortment of robots with varying strengths and weaknesses.
  Neutral
Some bots are faster and better at traversal with hovering abilities allowing them to fly around the battlefield, while others are slow-moving, heavily armored and deadly at close range.
  Positive
This kind of on-the-fly versatility would be nice to have in the campaign.
  Positive
Plug Slam rises above "CTF clone" status due to the game's nifty physics engine.
  Positive
Cobalt never feels faster than it does here because of the switched emphasis on terrain navigation instead of combat.
  Negative
The same moves you would use to send bullets back at enemies can be used to pass plugs to teammates and score goals.
  Negative
The game's use of momentum is almost as important here as it is in the speed challenge missions.
  Negative
A well-timed jump at the end of a downward slope can send you soaring across the screen.
  Negative
Oxeye strategically places bounce pads throughout the map to aid this.
  Neutral
You can easily roll onto a bounce pad and chuck the plug across the map and into the goal.
  Positive
Bounce pads also help transition the player between different levels of a map, boosting the sense of verticality.
  Negative
Cobalt's multiplayer suggests how much more the game could be, where its versatility isn't bogged down by Oxeye's problematic enemy encounters.
  Negative
The new ideas Cobalt does have don't always coalesce as gracefully as they need to, but it's a surprisingly deep, and often frustrating, action platformer.
  Negative
It felt like playing through an old favorite and realizing it wasn't quite what you remembered  but kind of liking it anyway.
  Negative
here.
  Neutral
