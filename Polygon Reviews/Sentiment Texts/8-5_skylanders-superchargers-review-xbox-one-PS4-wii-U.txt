Even a teenager isn't immune to the charms of Skylanders: Superchargers' toys.
  Negative
Going on four years now, Skylanders continues to improve and impress and not just in its eclectic design of wondrous toys, the video game too seems in a race with itself to always outdo its predecessor.
  Positive
This year, developer Vicarious Visions delivers a vehicle-themed sequel that brings with it a seismic shift in the way you play the game's main campaign and a host of additions meant to extend the life of the title well past completion.
  Positive
Cooperative online and local play, Mario-Kart-esque racing, an improved version of Skylander's in-game card game, daily adventure challenges and more help to soften the blow of the game's high price of entry.
  Positive
Most importantly though, all of that content, all of the care shown in sculpting toys and crafting code, comes together to deliver an experience that is packed with surprises and never gets dull, be the player a child, a parent, or even a cantankerous teen.
  Negative
The biggest change that Superchargers brings to the Skylanders franchise is the addition of vehicles.
  Positive
The eponymous Superchargers of the game are character toys that match up with specific cars, planes or boats.
  Neutral
While any character, even the characters from previous games, can use any vehicle, when you match a Supercharger with their ride, the pairing gets a bonus.
  Neutral
As with Skylanders' many character toys, the vehicles each have their own abilities and are upgradable.
  Negative
Though where characters have a skill tree they invest in to unlock new abilities, vehicles are upgraded by earning new parts and swapping them out to mix-and-match your way to a personal favorite.
  Negative
After examining one minutely-detailed car, my son Tristan, every bit a surly -year-old grump, gave the little toy a nudge and watched it roll a few inches across the carpet in front of our television.
  Negative
"That's cool," he said, almost with regret.
  Negative
And it is.
  Positive
The Crypt Crusher is a coffin on three wheels.
  Neutral
A grimacing Day of the Dead skull decorates its hood and two over-sized skeletal hands jutting out of twin exhaust pipes, hold the single over-sized rear wheel in place.
  Negative
Like all of Skylanders toys, it's meant to be a real world representation of what you get in the game.
  Negative
But Skylanders: Superchargers' toys are the most toy-like to date.
  Negative
That's because they include vehicles with working wheels that can be more actively played with.
  Neutral
Despite Skylanders: Superchargers' heavy reliance on vehicles, the game isn't just one giant racetrack: That's part of the brilliance of Supercharger's design.
  Negative
Of the -something vehicle missions, many play more like adventure titles, with players zipping around a landscape shooting at enemies as they wheel about them, or racing around massive arenas to peck away at lumbering bosses.
  Negative
The game includes traditional kart racing, but it doesn't lean on that.
  Neutral
And those included racing tracks are brilliantly designed set pieces that both play into the game's storyline and provide the racers with a multitude of paths and ways to win.
  Positive
The best part of the vehicle missions is how cooperative play works.
  Positive
Instead of having the two local players hop into two vehicles and then try to deal with the visual cacophony of high-speed, button-mashing, split-screen action gaming, Superchargers drops both players into one vehicle.
  Negative
One of the players focuses on driving while the other handles the weapons.
  Neutral
It's an excellent pairing that made the cooperative play something to look forward to, and improved upon the basic elements of those action vehicle missions.
  Very positive
As much as I enjoyed playing through the game's many vehicle missions, it was the on-foot gameplay that dazzled the most.
  Negative
Each setting in the game's story seemed to up the outlandishness and expectations of what the developers might drop you into next.
  Neutral
I won't bulletpoint the specifics of everything the game delivers, because some of the joy of playing through Superchargers was in discovering just how eclectic it is.
  Positive
But I will say the missions seemed designed to fete the history of gaming.
  Negative
We'd be playing through a level that reminded me of LittleBigPlanet or Rampage or Tempest.
  Negative
I can't remember how many times Tristan or I would look at the other grinning and just say something like "Man, this is awesome."
  Negative
The levels play with gravity, with humor, with painterly backdrops and size.
  Positive
There are even clever tweaks at some of gaming's tropes.
  Positive
Just when you think you've seen it all, you find yourself sitting back down to do something new and spectacular.
  Negative
The best part is that the game never really ends.
  Positive
The racing can be played and replayed either from Supercharger's Academy  the hub of the game  or from the start menu.
  Positive
It comes with four maps and supports online and local co-op play.
  Neutral
While it likely won't live up to the latest Mario Kart, I found the racing to be well worth revisiting.
  Positive
There's also the ability to play hands of reworked collectible card game Skystones Overdrive either against the AI or in-game with online friends.
  Positive
Once completed, the Academy becomes a sort of one-stop-shop for this sort of after-game play.
  Negative
Along with those extra games, you can pick up daily new missions in the game's levels, take on challenges and decorate the place with collectibles.
  Positive
Perhaps because the game has so much content beyond the campaign, the developers have also introduced Portal Master rank.
  Negative
This shows what level the player is and also is used to unlock special, game-wide abilities, like a buff for gold and experience point gains, or one-use, summoning skills.
  Negative
All that said, the game isn't without its faults  some of which have persisted since the series launched in .
  Negative
Cooperative play still leashes the two characters together, making it exceedingly annoying at times to explore.
  Negative
The difficulty setting seems to simply increase the damage enemies can take and dish-out.
  Negative
As much as I loved playing through the eclectic mix of missions, they almost all felt far too short.
  Negative
Some seemed to take just minutes to burn through, where even the chunkiest of levels gave you barely enough time to appreciate what you were playing.
  Negative
The Nintendo version of Superchargers comes with a fun surprise: A chance to play through the game as Donkey Kong with his Barrel Blaster car or Hammer Smash Bowser with his Clown Cruiser.
  Positive
Not only are both toys fantastic little creations, the characters also double as amiibo for use in other Nintendo games.
  Negative
I tried my hand at both characters and their vehicles for a small portion of the game on Wii U and enjoyed what I played.
  Very positive
Both characters are colorful additions to an already colorful game and both have clever attacks and upgrades.
  Positive
While using either of the Nintendo characters doesn't change the game's plot at all your supporting cast don't even seem to notice anything's up when they chat with you, the new moves and look are a pretty neat addition.
  Positive
The Wii U version doesn't look quite as nice as the PlayStation  and Xbox One versions, but you do gain the ability to play the game on your Gamepad, without the need for a television, if you'd like.
  Negative
The bad news for those colorful charactgers is that they only come in starter packs.
  Negative
You get Donkey Kong, his car and Super Shot Stealth Elf in the Wii U version and the Wii and DS versions swap out the Nintendo folk with Bowser and his ride.
  Negative
And these particular Nintendo Skylanders won't work on the PlayStation  nor the Xbox One ... I tried.
  Negative
And of course, the game still does include optional, locked away content that can only be played with additional purchases.
  Negative
The side stories in the game, most of which have to be unlocked with new purchases of vehicles or characters not included in the starter pack, aren't very simple to find.
  Negative
Instead of giving you a place to pop in and select those missed missions, players will have to either remember which mission they were located in or play through the whole game again.
  Negative
While the in-game advertising for these unlockables seems much less egregious than in previous games, it's still there and those locks do make certain elements of the game feel a bit anemic.
  Negative
The game is a vehicle-centric title, not a car-centric one.
  Negative
But the starter pack only comes with that one type of vehicle.
  Negative
If you want to see what it's like to fly in the game or race on top of or underneath the waves of Skylands, you're going to need to buy the toys to do it.
  Negative
And as fun as those driving levels and courses are, the optional sea and air missions are incredible, and the twist those vehicles bring to racing help set it apart from other kart racers.
  Positive
After beating the game, there are also ten elementally-aligned vehicle missions that can be played if you have the character with the right element.
  Negative
Skylanders: Superchargers is a smorgasbord of gameplay and aesthetics, a much-improved romp through the toy-fueled world of Skylands.
  Negative
But at times it feels too hurried to allow you to enjoy the diversity of play and aesthetic it has on offer, leaving the game bordering on staccato, almost to a fault.
  Negative
That such an enjoyable ending and potentially robust offering of post-game play is marred by a bulk of the game's push for paid add-ons is disappointing.
  Negative
That said, Superchargers remains the best of the franchise to date, delivering players into a rich tapestry of genres peopled with colorful characters, an amusing storyline and a genuinely fun experience to share with friends and family.
  Positive
here.
