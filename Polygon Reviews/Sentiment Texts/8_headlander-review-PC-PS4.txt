Headlander is a Double Fine staple: a one-off goof turned into a fully realized reality.
  Negative
With Grim Fandango, it was a working stiff Grim Reaper in a Dia de los Muertos world.
  Negative
Psychonauts was psychic summer camp.
  Neutral
Stacking was Matryoshka dolls come to life, and Brutal Legend was a roadies rock and roll fantasy.
  Negative
With Headlander, Double Fine takes a free-floating, body stealing head and makes it a sci-fi hero.
  Negative
Its a pretty good hook.
  Positive
The biggest surprise in Headlander is the flip in priorities it signals from so much of Double Fines other output, which ultimately have put the joke and the story ahead of almost everything else.
  Negative
Headlander isnt Double Fines funniest story.
  Positive
But it might be their best game in a long time.
  Negative
Headlanders premise is s-era sci-fi at its best.
  Positive
As humans depleted their resources and poisoned their world, scientists devised a way to move human consciousness into artificial brains and robotic bodies.
  Negative
Hundreds of years later, you wake up in an unfamiliar future as, well, a disembodied head  one of three, choosable at the beginning of the game.
  Positive
Its not clear where you came from or who you are, other than that youre the only remaining tenth of a human left in the universe.
  Negative
And with the help of the mysterious ERL, youll have to use your conveniently socketed, rocket-powered head to unravel the Orwellian Methusaleh AIs control over everything, and hopefully figure out just what happened.
  Negative
Mechanically, Headlander is completely on the nose.
  Positive
The goofball idea of Disembodied Head Can Steal Bodies is pushed just about as far as it can go within a structure that most closely resembles item-gated action adventure games like Metroid.
  Negative
See, Methusalehs perfectly contained society is awash in harsh security measures.
  Positive
Doors, for example, wont open for just any head.
  Positive
Instead, youll need to be attached to a body to walk through even the most basic portal.
  Negative
As you sow discord in the world, youll need to find an escalating color code of bodies to go through corresponding doors, whether by walking up to them or shooting a laser at them.
  Negative
This is a relatively simple idea thats explored very meticulously throughout Headlander.
  Negative
Like I said, security scales up through a color code: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet, and each notch is attached to a more powerful security robot, referred to as a Shepherd.
  Positive
Each Shepherd can open their color and the colors below their rank, and each Shepherds beam bounces when it hits a wall.
  Negative
The more powerful the Shepherd, the more bounces that laser will get.
  Positive
This is used to build puzzles that escalate in complexity throughout the game.
  Negative
Early on the most challenging thing you may encounter is needing to open a door that your robot security body cant access, as Shepherds and citizens alike cant jump but doors stay open a bit after their shot, at which point, your head can fly through.
  Negative
Eventually youll need to find perfect bounce points for your lasers to hit spots that are offscreen, or to use Shepherds with multi-beam lasers to activate numerous color-coded points at once.
  Negative
Even combat tends toward the puzzle-minded, rather than twitch shooting.
  Negative
Despite a control scheme that resembles arcade run-and-gun games  you aim with the mouse or right stick on the controller  fights tend toward the methodical, and bodies are broadly disposable.
  Very negative
Leaving your assumed body is even a valid tactic, as you can pull the heads off of Shepherds and other enemies if you can avoid their attempts to bat you off.
  Negative
This contributes to a real sense of problem-solving during fights, and checkpoints tend to be room-to-room, meaning failing an experiment doesnt cost a lot of time.
  Negative
And bouncing a shot off a ceiling and popping a Shepherds head off is always fun.
  Positive
You can also use your micro tractor beam to manipulate objects in the world that arent just the heads you can pull of bodies.
  Negative
Some passageways are plugged by small grates that can be pulled off, allowing you to find secret areas with upgrades to your survivability or allowing forward progress through the game.
  Negative
This discovery is a key part in Headlanders continued appeal  theres a real sense that theres always another little secret or pickup around the corner if you just look for it.
  Negative
Some of these pickups are major upgrades for your head, including a refracting shield and the ability to boost.
  Positive
These improvements add new combat options and unlock new areas, allowing for backtracking to enter previously inaccessible spaces.
  Negative
Its a good loop that doesnt feel padded.
  Positive
Instead, returning to places youve already seen feels like an optional elaboration on the world.
  Negative
Headlander is, in many ways, the most mechanically sound, well-designed Double Fine action game I can remember.
  Negative
It doesn't feel like it's leaning quite so hard on the personality that's defined the studio's other work.
  Negative
Which is good, because while Headlander's aesthetic is very strong and very cool  its reminiscent of s-era outsider sci-fi like Logans Run and Silent Running smashed into the cheap black and white monster movie schtick of the s.
  Positive
But the humor and story that's dominated Double Fine's previous games feels more thinly developed here.
  Positive
The premise is appropriately ridiculous and a lot of fun, yes, and there are a number of weird, goofy opportunities to take that ball or head, as the case may be and run with it.
  Negative
I got a chuckle out of it the first few times I plopped off someones head and stole their body, and once or twice it was even a dog!
  Very negative
I was on a dogs body!
  Negative
Thats about enough of a joke to last an hour or two of Headlanders six to seven or so hours of game.
  Negative
But once that wears off, the funny recedes more and more into the background.
  Positive
There are some jokes in there about an AI obsessed with chess and the pawns she conscripts from robot society for her game, and some incidental dialogue from other citizens scattered around the world.
  Negative
Richard Steven Horowitz  a Double Fine regular, he voiced Raz in Pyschonauts as well as the titular character in Nickelodeons Invader Zim  turns in some great lines as the Mappy robots and automated turrets.
  Negative
But Headlanders emphasis on a silent protagonist, while narratively logical, leaves something of a vacuum that not even multiple seemingly-omnipotent voices around you cant quite fill.
  Negative
It doesnt make the game part of Headlander any worse, but it is just a little less capital-F "Fun" than Double Fines usual output.
  Negative
Not quite as strangely, but somewhat off-putting nonetheless, Headlander features some hooks it never follows up on.
  Negative
There are allusions to sidequests in the games  small collectibles or tasks to grab for other citizens  but in my time playing through and seeing most of the game, I came across just a few opportunities like this.
  Negative
It feels like this was going to be more than it is now, and I kept looking, hoping for just a bit more variety than I found.
  Negative
Also, in a confusing departure from genre dogma, there are a number of abilities in Headlanders seemingly-optional upgrade tree that feel like anything but, those these are rarely explained  and I could see a reality where I accidentally leveled the wrong way and screwed myself until I found more points to fix my own mess.
  Negative
Its not game-breaking, and I had what I needed, usually, but Headlander demonstrates a latent, low-level distaste for tutorial or explanation that can be a little frustrating in hindsight.
  Negative
Its not always clear but Headlander doesnt overstay its welcome, and it doesnt waste time on extraneous stuff.
  Very negative
Instead, Headlander finds smart core mechanics and a really cool idea and pushes them both to smart places that make for a game remains engaging even as it steadily grows more challenging.
  Positive
Its not the funniest guy in the room, but its still a lot of fun to hang around with.
  Positive
here.
