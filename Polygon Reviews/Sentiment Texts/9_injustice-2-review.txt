Injustice  is an immensely satisfying game chiefly for its standout bad guy: Superman.
  Positive
While the planet-killing alien Brainiac is ostensibly the DC Universe fighting games main antagonist, developer NetherRealm Studios presents Superman as such an unlikeable dick in Injustice s outstanding story mode that beating up the Man of Steel and his allies is incredibly gratifying.
  Negative
Theres such an impressive amount of content  characters, modes, daily activities  in Injustice  that it may seem strange to focus on how much fun it is to hate Superman.
  Positive
But I really dislike Superman.
  Negative
And Injustice s single-player campaign is such a noticeable leap forward in terms of quality  and fighting game story modes are kind of NetherRealms specialty  that seeing the story through to its end is easily the games biggest draw.
  Positive
Injustice  picks up a few years after the cataclysmic events of Injustice: Gods Among Us.
  Negative
Superman sits imprisoned in a red sun jail cell that keeps his powers in check.
  Negative
Batman and his team of reformed bad guys and new allies  Harley Quinn, Green Lantern, Blue Beetle, Firestorm  fight to restore civilization in the wake of Supermans overreaching control of Earth in the first game.
  Negative
Wonder Woman, Black Adam and newcomer Supergirl work to free Superman in an attempt to fend off a new threat, Brainiac.
  Positive
Brainiac is here to kill the last remaining Kryptonians and also destroy Earth, Batman and Supermans respective ideologies about how best to protect Earth and its people are at the heart of Injustice s conflict.
  Negative
Its a simpler, more engaging story than the alternative universe-spanning jumble of Injustice: Gods Among Us, and it doesnt necessarily require intimate knowledge of Injustices incredibly strange backstory.
  Negative
That said, brushing up on the game series lore wont hurt.
  Negative
Like developer NetherRealms other fighting games, the story mode is fun, comic book crossover event-caliber stuff in which characters efficiently explain their motivation for why they need to settle their differences in a best of three match.
  Positive
Over the course of  lengthy chapters, a mix of gorgeously produced cutscenes interspersed with one-on-one brawls, youll get control of about half the games roster.
  Negative
These chapters flow seamlessly from fights to cutscenes and back again to fights.
  Negative
In some matches, youll get to choose from one of two characters  Firestorm or Blue Beetle, Green Arrow or Black Canary  and the branching transitions feel surprisingly elegant.
  Positive
Everything looks spectactular.
  Neutral
: Injustice s cut scenes are beautifully lit and feature some of the most impressive facial animation Ive ever seen in a fighting game.
  Positive
And even as the game transitions back to one-on-one fights, Injustice  manages to look, well, pretty.
  Positive
Thats not the adjective Id expected to employ for one of NetherRealms titles, many of which are intentionally ugly, gory Mortal Kombat games, but here we are.
  Very negative
This game looks really, really good.
  Very positive
Story mode offers a handful of hours of pulpy enjoyment, and there are good reasons to replay portions of Injustice  to experience the games alternate story paths.
  Negative
Its also the best way to start leveling up some of the games characters while also earning some of the games loot, one of the big new additions from Injustice: Gods Among Us.
  Positive
As players fight their way through all of the games online and offline modes, theyll earn experience and loot boxes filled with random goodies: gear, armor, shaders, character abilities.
  Negative
Those loot boxes come in a variety of tiers bronze, silver, gold, etc., and the rarity and quality of the unlockable items contained within depends on the box.
  Positive
Everything contained within can feel frustratingly random  these are video game loot boxes after all  as players will earn gear for characters they may never ultimately play.
  Negative
Injustice  will let players cash in their junk gear for credits, however, which can in turn be spent on  more loot boxes.
  Negative
One downside to a lot of the loot in Injustice : its gated by character level.
  Neutral
During my playthrough of the games story mode, I unlocked plenty of level  items for Supergirl, Wonder Woman and Batman, a lot of which I couldnt actually equip for way too long.
  Negative
Fortunately, NetherRealm has done an excellent job of making the games inventory and load out interfaces feel elegant.
  Positive
Managing and selling your gear is easy and efficient.
  Positive
There is some fun cosmetic flavor to a lot of this stuff, so playing DC Universe dress up  while watching stat numbers go up!
  Positive
still manages to be satisfying, if not entirely consequential.
  Positive
In the end, a lot of the equippable gear, which affects character stats like strength and health, feels like it has little real noticeable impact on gameplay.
  Negative
Most things quickly felt disposable after a new, slightly more powerful, slightly more shiny thing came along in the next loot box.
  Negative
Injustice s fighting mechanics havent changed much from the previous game.
  Neutral
Players have an arsenal of special moves and pre-programmed combos at their disposal, and a meter that fills up during battle lets players modify certain moves and pull off flashy attacks Supergirl, for example, will throw her enemy around the sun and smash them into a giant asteroid.
  Negative
Injustice: Gods Among Us Clash system, in which a player can interrupt an opponents attack and force them wager a portion of their meter, is also back.
  Negative
Its still fun to see heroes and villains square off  and talk trash  up close in clashes and those moments look better than ever.
  Positive
Injustice  gives players additional options for defense; players can burn portions of their meter to perform an evade roll or recover mid-air.
  Negative
Theres a lot to digest and remember here, and casual players looking for casual fighting game fun may never wind up digging into this stuff.
  Positive
But if youre looking for depth, NetherRealm provides.
  Negative
Players can duke it out against one another in a huge variety of modes, including one-on-one ranked and unranked online battles, King of the Hill sessions and local versus multiplayer.
  Negative
The games online components performed well during my time with multiplayer, though not without the occasional bit of noticeable, game-pausing lag.
  Negative
NetherRealm surfaces helpful information about your online opponents in multiplayer, including ping and your odds of winning against an opponent, and if someone cancels a match, youre quickly thrown into another
Offline, players have a lot to stay busy with once theyre done with the single-player story.
  Very negative
Most interesting is Injustice s Multiverse mode, in which weekly, daily and even hourly challenges are available to play, each with their own rewards.
  Negative
Fighting game fans familiar with Mortal Kombats Living Towers mode will understand what Multiverse mode  pitched as a never-ending series of alternate universe Earths, each with their own particular quirks  is all about.
  Negative
Its a great excuse to revisit the game every day, multiple times a day.
  Positive
Injustice  is NetherRealm once again outdoing itself.
  Negative
This is the best, most polished, most impressively produced story mode to ever feature in a fighting game.
  Very positive
The games cast  more than a dozen of which are newly playable characters  is varied and interesting, thanks to additions like Swamp Thing, Supergirl and the Red Lantern who has a blood-vomiting space cat, Atrocitus.
  Positive
Even if you arent a diehard DC Universe fan, theres bound to be someone on the roster youll love to play as.
  Negative
Plus, you get to beat up Superman.
  Negative
