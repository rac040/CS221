This sequel is brutal and savage in ways the  original never dared to be, but it's not its hyper violence that I can't stop thinking about.
  Negative
Nor is it its returning, super-tight gameplay loop, which demands memorization and reckless improvisation in equal, satisfying measures.
  Negative
In fact, Hotline Miami s memorability has nothing to do with the strengths of the original at all, and that's exactly what makes it so memorable.
  Positive
It's a bold deviation from its predecessor in a lot of ways  some of which work, some of which dont  but its also a departure from the storytelling conventions by which almost all games swear.
  Positive
It's not as smooth or streamlined as the original, but those very changes make it one of the most fascinating games I've ever played.
  Positive
Hotline Miami  is still a game about weaving together strings of murders as recklessly and variedly as possible, which is just as rad as it was the last time around.
  Negative
No other action game has come close to building such a condensed, trance-like loop of repeated failure and refinement, culminating in a perfect, super stylish run through each stage.
  Negative
It's always challenging, never too frustrating, and the payoff is frequent and sublime.
  Positive
A lot more is expected of the player this time around, though.
  Negative
Levels are much, much larger than they were in the original, with the largest among them hosting small armies of enemies to kill and not get killed by.
  Negative
There are more enemies that can only be killed in certain ways  some only with guns, some only with melee attacks  forcing you to constantly switch-up your approach, and ensuring that you can't cheese your way through a level with a single weapon.
  Negative
Hotline Miami  is considerably more difficult than its predecessor, which makes it all the more rewarding when you finally finish sweeping up a stage.
  Negative
But the longer levels deter the kind of hypnotic recklessness I loved in Hotline Miami.
  Positive
Some floors take a long time to clean out, and the longer you spend making headway, the more demoralizing your foolhardy deaths become.
  Negative
There's a bigger emphasis on survival, which can't help but take some of the emphasis away from wanton carnage.
  Positive
Though the gameplay is a bit less fluid, the presentation of Hotline Miami  is even slicker than it ever was in the original.
  Negative
The star of the show is the soundtrack, which I cannot praise enough.
  Negative
It's a lovingly curated list of synth-driven pump-up jams that sounds like a best-of compilation of non-existent, dope-as-hell 's slasher flicks and action-packed cop shows.
  Negative
Ive been letting the game idle in the background while I work, just so I can keep listening to my favorite tracks  Im listening to one right now, actually, as I write this.
  Negative
Other than the increased challenge, the core gameplay of Hotline Miami  isn't so different from the original  but the framework containing that gameplay is, and thats where things start getting really interesting.
  Negative
For starters, there are nine different playable characters one of which is actually a group of five characters, each with their own mechanics and unlockables.
  Negative
Gone is the idea of collecting a vast catalog of masks and choosing the best one for your play style with each stage.
  Positive
Each level in Hotline Miami  casts you in one of those nine roles, giving you a far more limited subset of masks or weapons to choose from.
  Negative
This structure is anything but formulaic, which is risky, considering the strength of Hotline Miami's formula.
  Negative
A few characters break out of that usual routine entirely, behaving totally differently from their counterparts.
  Negative
Evan, for example, is a writer who prefers non-fatal combat  unless you kill someone, which sends him into a bloody rage.
  Negative
One character is a guerrilla soldier who uses just one weapon, which he must collect ammo for if he runs out.
  Negative
Some characters are more interesting and unique than others, but it's telling that the best time I had in Hotline Miami  is when I played as The Fans, a group of violent vigilantes designed to simulate the experience of playing the original Hotline Miami.
  Positive
When playing as The Fans, you can choose between a small collection of masks with some wild powers, like one that lets you dodge roll under enemy fire, or one that starts you with two sub-machine guns, allowing you to get down on some serious John Woo shit.
  Negative
The Fans represent the most fun Ive had playing this series, because they best tap into the mechanics that make Hotline Miami great.
  Positive
I always missed them when they werent around.
  Negative
It's almost as if the events of Hotline Miami  were shuffled and tossed up in the air, then told in the order that they landed.
  Negative
You'll get the occasional moments of lucidity  entire chapters told from the same perspective, for instance  but mostly, the game ping-pongs between people, places and decades with each new level.
  Positive
You have to work to make the games stars align, but its work thats totally worth doing.
  Positive
Hotline Miami  almost plays out like a drug-addled mystery novel.
  Negative
I became obsessed with the lore of the series masked killing cabal, which the game explores both the origins and terminus of, with surprisingly deep and personal stories in between.
  Negative
There are some awkward deviations here and there  sometimes characters are thrown into a combat sequence with barebones, nonsensical exposition to guide them  but on the whole, its a compelling tale that culminates in, bar none, the craziest, most audacious ending Ive ever seen in a video game.
  Very negative
Hotline Miami  is also fucked up in a big, big way.
  Positive
In one sequence, your character slowly beats another playable character to death as they calmly, hauntingly beg for their life.
  Negative
There are way more, way gorier executions youll exact on the games beefier enemies.
  Negative
The game also kicks off with a depiction of implied sexual violence which, for what its worth, an opening prompt allows you to skip before you even start playing.
  Negative
Hotline Miami was certainly a violent game, but it was much easier to simply think of your slain enemies as blood-soaked piles of points.
  Negative
Hotline Miami  certainly has that pursuit, but its also more of a character piece, making its exponentially increased carnage that much harder to stomach.
  Neutral
The original Hotline Miami asks a question in one of its early scenes: "Do you like hurting other people?"
  Neutral
Hotline Miami  expects an answer.
  Negative
