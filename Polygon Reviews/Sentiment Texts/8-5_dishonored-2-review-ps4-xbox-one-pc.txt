Dishonored  is a sequel in a classic vein.
  Positive
When Dishonored was released in , it was a throwback shot across the bow of AAA games.
  Positive
It largely avoided the spectacular action and setpieces of big-budget titles, and instead went back to the well of the late-'searly-'s renaissance of first-person action games on the PC platform  particularly the Thief series.
  Negative
That Dishonored developer Arkane so liberally borrowed from defunct developer Looking Glass' formula and ideas wasn't a bad thing, because it capitalized on a desire for something different from the status quo.
  Very negative
That Dishonored's world and fiction were so distinctive and powerful, driven by phenomenal art direction, also helped.
  Very positive
In the era of Thief, sequels were the opportunity to follow through on ideas not fully realized, rather than to change dramatically, and in that regard, Arkane continues to follow that old legacy.
  Negative
In almost every way, Dishonored  is a refinement of the original game's ideas and concepts, an elaboration and improvement.
  Positive
Levels feel more like places than ever, and there's even more room for exploration and collectible mining.
  Negative
But in some ways, Arkane's desire to make things "better" doesn't always feel for the best.
  Negative
Dishonored  is a first-person stealth-ish game set in the Empire of the Isles, a Dickensian steampunk fiction full of wonders and nightmares alike, where technology and science are powered by oil harvested from a whale population being driven to extinction.
  Negative
Sitting next to a miraculous era of industrial revolution is a shadow world of dark, ritual magic and mysterious, godlike powers.
  Negative
Amid this unstable collision of progress and the past sits the Empress of the Isles, Emily Kaldwin, daughter of the murdered Jessamine Kaldwin and the disgraced-then-redeemed Royal Protector, Corvo Attano.
  Very negative
As whispers and rumors seek to undermine the throne, the empire is thrown into chaos as the Duke of the island of Serkonos and a powerful witch named Delilah stage a violent coup.
  Negative
This all happens almost immediately, and at this point, Dishonored  gives you a choice  to play as Dishonored's protagonist, the Royal Protector Corvo, or as his daughter, the Empress Emily.
  Negative
Once you make your call, things happen quickly, and your chosen character must escape Dunwall, unravel the conspiracy at hand, retake the throne and save their only remaining family.
  Negative
The way you do that is up to you.
  Positive
Dishonored , as with the original game, offers a fairly broad toolset.
  Negative
Corvo and Emily are both extremely nimble Victorian ninjas, and you're given the appearance of carte blanche to judiciously distribute murder or nonlethal beatdowns to anyone who gets in your way  or to avoid almost everyone entirely as you skulk through alleys and across the rooftops of the empire.
  Negative
That freedom isn't without consequences, however.
  Negative
Watching your every move is the mysterious Outsider, a supernatural force who rules the Void, a parallel shadow universe that exists outside of Dishonored 's physical reality.
  Positive
Early on, the Outsider offers his help in your efforts to retake the throne in the form of his Mark, a black brand that grants a host of powers and abilities, should you choose to accept it.
  Negative
As in the first game, this isn't just lip service to presentation or story  you're given the option of forgoing the Outsider's brand and giving up on all of Dishonored 's supernatural abilities.
  Negative
It's a tacit acknowledgment of the kind of game this is, one with old-school sensibilities and design ideas within the trappings of a modern game.
  Positive
If you want to make things harder on yourself, then Dishonored  is more than happy to help you with that.
  Positive
But regardless of whether you accept the Outsider's help, he's watching how you conduct yourself, and so is the game.
  Positive
If you cut a bloody swath through the world, it will become a more grim place bodies everywhere attract lethal vermin, which leads to more dead, more misery and a generally bad time for everyone.
  Negative
If you can avoid a lot of killing, then the empire might hold itself together when things are all over.
  Negative
The combat system has been improved and refined somewhat since Dishonored, if you don't really care about how the empire fares.
  Positive
But, Corvo and Emily's swordsmanship notwithstanding, the game's unforgiving difficulty, and the sheer number of guards and their propensity to call in help, makes direct conflict a Pretty Bad Idea until you've leveled up some of your abilities.
  Negative
You can build for fighting, though, if you want to, and there are some pretty awesome combat abilities, most of which make their return from the original game.
  Negative
But for every kill you land, you're adding to the overall level of resistance you'll meet later in the game, per the aforementioned Chaos system  not to mention the passive-aggressive nagging of the Outsider and his dislike for excessive murder.
  Negative
In general, this isn't that big a hardship, because for all of Dishonored 's gameplay options, it feels most geared toward stealthy play.
  Negative
Many of the combat powers are cool, it's true, and there are many environmental means of disposing of enemies.
  Positive
But the coolest abilities are traversal-oriented.
  Negative
The meat and potatoes of Dishonored 's movement toolset is a short-range teleport, which both Corvo and Emily have a version of  a phantom pair of arms pulling her forward for Emily, and a more conventional dash forward for Corvo.
  Negative
These help you navigate upward and around conflict, as well as providing a means of accessing all manner of apartments and shops and other places you're maybe not supposed to be in, legally speaking.
  Negative
These abilities were always my priority, because one of Dishonored 's biggest strengths, and biggest improvements, is the density of its game world.
  Positive
There were plenty of buildings to navigate and alleys to stalk through in the last game, but in Dishonored , each city and environment provides a much greater sense of verticality and fullness.
  Positive
Arkane has given in fully to the old-school PC FPSRPG hybrid tendency of "stuff in every container," and it's deeply engrossing for it.
  Positive
I practically crawled through every inch of every level, looking for runes to upgrade my abilities, bone charms  which grant modifiers and improvements to your character, like invisibly teleporting  and even paintings and other baubles.
  Negative
This was in part to gather stuff, true, but Dishonored  also does an excellent job of leaving its world-building and fiction everywhere.
  Positive
That world is probably Dishonored 's greatest inherited strength.
  Positive
Dishonored was so memorable in part because it was something no one had ever seen, taking some familiar elements of the Thief series and its vaguely steampunk setting and blowing it wide open with whalers, gods and technology.
  Positive
Dishonored  is an excellent elaboration on that, and moreover, it takes the technological advances of the modern console era and applies them to fantastic effect.
  Positive
There are at least two levels in Dishonored  that shift and change in real time in ways I don't think I've ever seen in a game before, and certainly not with the audacity and ambition they do here.
  Negative
Even when Dishonored 's levels aren't acting as a technological tour de force, they generally display a remarkable amount of complexity and flexibility, and I rarely grew tired of exploring every corner I could, and finding ways into the corners I wasn't sure I could access.
  Positive
I found myself less thrilled with the enemies I found in those levels, however.
  Positive
Granted, the powers at Emily's and Corvo's disposal allow for some truly breathtaking bits of ingenuity my personal favorite power is Domino, which allows you to link the fate of multiple targets, and part of the reason this works is the increased awareness of enemies.
  Positive
Sound is a much more common trigger for enemy AI than it was before, and the range of awareness is considerably expanded.
  Negative
Enemies also have literal tunnel vision that rarely extends upward, which encourages a Batman-style perspective on things whenever possible, which is just about always a cool way to make things happen.
  Negative
But Outsider protect you if you're on the ground.
  Positive
Guards in Dishonored weren't morons, but the AI in Dishonored  makes them look like corpses in comparison.
  Negative
The stealth model in the game isn't based on light and shadow.
  Negative
Rather, it's primarily about field of view, and AI units in Dishonored  have  excellent peripheral vision, and  see extremely goddamned far.
  Very positive
As the game is entirely first-person, there's a lot of risk in even leaning over cover to see where guards are, because they can quickly see you while you're doing it.
  Negative
My brain may be playing tricks on me, but this seemed more pronounced with Corvo than Emily in my time spent with both characters  maybe the Royal Protector's body is bigger and thus more difficult to hide or obscure?
  Negative
Regardless, when you're seen, enemies go from relaxed to curious to alarmed to Holy Shit Get Them with varying degrees of rapidity.
  Negative
The default is quite fast, even on normal difficulty, and once enemies are alarmed, they just about immediately call out to their friends.
  Negative
There are ways to nip that in the bud and quickly react.
  Negative
There are sleep darts or spells or a quick stab through the throat, but regardless, it's a pretty big wrench in the plans of a stealth player  especially considering the game gives you a performance rating when you're finished, showing how stealthy you were, whether you were ever seen, whether you were completely nonlethal, etc.
  Negative
For me, as a stealth player, this meant a lot more saving and reloading than in just about any stealth game I've played in recent memory, especially when I was trying for no-kill, ghost playthroughs of missions.
  Negative
And while the satisfaction of overcoming particularly challenging sections was more pronounced in some ways, it felt like a bit of a buzzkill constantly going to the pause menu to use the newly added  and greatly appreciated  quicksave feature.
  Positive
This is by far the thing that irked me the most in Dishonored , but the game isn't without some other annoyances.
  Negative
For one, despite the fantastic in-world storytelling and fiction development, the voice acting in Dishonored  is, once again, often really, really bad, especially with two of its Hollywood leads.
  Negative
Vincent D'Onofrio and Rosario Dawson are excellent actors, but their performances here are almost unbearable.
  Positive
Many cutscenes are also strangely framed or jarringly placed, with out-of-place dips to black that are disruptive to pacing.
  Negative
But some of the weirdest problems are possible deal-breakers for the most hardcore fans of Dishonored 's basic design ideas.
  Negative
First, there's currently no way to replay a mission  not from the mission clear screen or another menu or the main game menu.
  Neutral
I learned this the hard way when I was devastated to find at the end of the penultimate mission that a guard had mysteriously died in a way I was deemed responsible for.
  Negative
My last manual, hard save had been several levels and many hours earlier, which functionally meant I was screwed, my attempt at a Merciful  read: completely nonlethal  playthrough dead.
  Very negative
There's also no current new game option in Dishonored , a truly bizarre omission for a game so clearly designed for multiple playthroughs on escalating levels of difficulty.
  Negative
I'm sure it will arrive at some point  this is , games almost always get new features  but  why wasn't it here now, in a game aimed at passionate fans of the original?
  Negative
In becoming even more itself, Dishonored  occasionally stumbles under the weight of the almost too-intelligent denizens of its "Whalepunk" setting.
  Negative
But despite a murderous new sense of difficulty and a few surprising, if minor, shortcomings, Dishonored  is a much more fleshed-out realization of the world of Dunwall and the star-crossed Kaldwin family.
  Negative
For such a miserable, conflicted place, Dunwall and the Isles are a place worth exploring, something gaming could use a lot more of.
  Negative
here.
  Neutral
