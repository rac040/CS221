The very first dialogue option in the game is one that asks the player to state Bruce Wayne's feelings on the consequences of living a double life.

Bruce is so seldom among people who know the whole of his identity that playing him is to play three people: Bruce Wayne, billionaire son of Gotham; Batman, the hyper-competent vigilante; and Bruce Wayne, the guy who is both of those and neither of them.
  Very positive
And then theres the opening scene in The Enemy Within, where you are Bruce Wayne as James Bond, infiltrating a fellow billionaires casino with augmented reality contact lenses and the voice of a former MI operative in the microphone in your ear.

But now that were into the second season of the series, we can also observe differences between Telltales last update and this one.
  Neutral
A few staple characters have been given a much-needed visual facelift  most notably James Gordon  who has settled into the role of police commissioner and the role of wearing a proper mustache.
  Negative
The mechanics have been given a shakedown as well, without a planned fight sequence in sight.
  Negative
Instead, the player makes the same choices  would you like to use your grapple gun to slam a sign post into a guys back, or just punch him in the freakin face?
  Negative
as timed decisions on the fly.
  Negative
Telltale kicked up the intensity of one of the final fights in the first season by switching from sedately planned choices to timed picks from inside the fight sequence.

And speaking of narrative choices and character mechanics, if youve played a Telltale Game, youve cried salt tears at  will remember that.
  Negative
Now, meet your new best friendemotional punch in the gut:

  Neutral
the one about his relationships with his allies.
  Neutral
At the end of the episode, alongside the usual summary of how your major choices aligned with the rest of Telltales playing audience, the game also gives you a rundown of the dominant emotion that you left major characters with, whether it was loyalty, vengeance or another nuanced option.
  Negative
I appreciated that, because every time Your relationship with  has changed appeared on the screen I second guessed every choice in the preceding conversation.
  Negative
Had I ruined their view of me by lying?
  Negative
Worse, had I ruined it by telling the truth?
  Negative
Telltale is no stranger to mixing up the will remember this formula for an extra emotional or funny punch, but your relationship has changed just shows how much the writers are thinking about how to guide the players feelings.

While The Enemy Within definitely continues the Telltale Batman trend of making you feel like youre making weighty choices as Bruce Wayne, it also continues a trend in Batman games of very easy detective work.
  Positive
Check the crime scene for all the reticles, literally connect a few dots and boom, youve escaped the Riddlers death trap.
  Negative
Even the actual riddles that he poses to you are deliberately simple, and the player is guided by onscreen quicktime instructions on solving a puzzle box.

Perhaps a working puzzle box challenge is too much to expect of a Telltale game.
  Negative
Perhaps Im betraying too much of my long-time affection for point and click puzzle games.
  Negative
But holy enigmas, Batman, its the goddamn Riddler.
  Negative
Is it too much to let the player actually feel smart for beating him?
  Negative
Enemy Within also feels like a lot of set up for a hook that arrives in practically the last scene  which is reasonable for a first of five episodes.

But I found my mind wandering through a lot of the gameplay, wondering when this would get around to wrapping up.

Batman: The Enemy Within makes incremental improvements on a successful formula  and the introduction of a new, relationship-focused choice mechanic was a big hit.
  Positive
It might drag here and there, but it sets up for big things to come in further installments.
  Negative
If Enemy Within is anything like its predecessor, a little patience will pay off.
