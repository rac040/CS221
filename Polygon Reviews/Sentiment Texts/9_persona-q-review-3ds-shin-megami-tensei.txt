Not content to be just a spin-off  or even "just" Persona's first entry on the Nintendo DS  Persona Q is a mashup of Atlus' much-loved role-playing series and the teeth-gnashing complexity of the dungeon crawling Etrian Odyssey franchise.
  Negative
It doesn't end there: The game also alters time itself to throw together the characters of Persona  and Persona  in the middle of their respective stories.
  Negative
This is the stuff fan fiction is made of.
  Positive
Where Atlus could have very easily stumbled, it's instead broken into a full-bodied sprint.
  Negative
Persona Q successfully uses every part of its DNA  a layered combat system, intricate mapmaking and character relationships  to create a tailored experience that wildly exceeds expectations of a superficial nature.
  Positive
Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth finds Persona 's Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad SEES and Persona 's Investigation Team summoned to an alternate version of the latter's Yasogami High.
  Negative
Trapped in a strange culture festival with two new companions, Zen and Rei, the teams join up to venture into a series of complex first-person labyrinths.
  Negative
Each dungeon holds a new clue to the mystery surrounding Yasogami, but exploring them is a difficult task.
  Negative
With a squad of five, players must physically map out their path with the DS touchscreen and defeat powerful foes within the depths.
  Negative
That journey varies depending on whether you choose the protagonist from Persona  or Persona  as your lead.
  Neutral
Persona Q is keen to let you play your way, and this initial separation is the first of many successful examples.
  Positive
I opted to put SEES first and foremost by selecting Persona 's main character  a decision that I was pleased to see reflected throughout my entire game.
  Positive
Although dialogue within and without dungeons would commonly feature cast members from both games, my experience was skewed more heavily toward what the Persona  characters were thinking and doing.
  Negative
Persona Q doesn't include the bond-building social link mechanics of the Persona games.
  Negative
Instead, characters and their relationships are expanded through cutscenes that appear as you progress through a system called "Stroll."
  Neutral
These scenes range from fluffy bites of the P and P cast coming together to talk and tease with one another, to more interesting moments that reflect on the responsibilities of being a Persona user and relationships with their companions.
  Neutral
Although these aren't as personally satisfying as spending copious amounts of one-on-one time with each character, they're effective at forging the bonds between the group as a whole and establishing a feeling of camaraderie.
  Negative
The Stroll scenes gave me a retroactive appreciation of how differently these two groups acted in their individual games.
  Positive
Persona 's cast always gave off more of a task force vibe  a group of people working together to defeat Shadows  while Persona 's characters relied heavily on each other as friends to accept themselves and awaken to their power.
  Positive
In Persona Q, the casts learn and grow based on their differences; for example, Persona 's Yukari seeks out a closer friendship with her team after seeing how the Persona  crew interacts.
  Positive
Coupled with in-dungeon banter as you explore, these moments do wonders establishing the personalities of each character for those who haven't played either game.
  Negative
It's clear that P's Chie is a tomboy who loves meat and martial arts, for example, or that P's icy Mitsuru has trouble letting people in.
  Negative
Getting to know each character I was reunited with paved the way for one of the game's "problems": deciding who to take into battle.
  Negative
You can choose from every party member from both Persona games, as well as Zen and Rei as a single unit.
  Neutral
Each character has specific elemental strengths and weaknesses; some characters are better used in the back row as long-range fighters, while others are powerful up front.
  Positive
Despite these differences, Persona Q makes it easy to mix and match heroes from both games while still forming a powerful team.
  Positive
Adding another layer to this level of customization is Persona Q's sub-persona system.
  Negative
As in previous Persona games, I was able to gather and combine personas  summonable creatures that represent the physical manifestations of each character's inner personality.
  Positive
There's one big, game-changing addition to the system, though: Now you can equip every party member with a second persona.
  Negative
When a party member wasn't suitably prepared with skills, whether from their personal persona or a sub-persona, I could easily swap out the sub to expand my options.
  Negative
This means that any character can be a healer, attack with specific elements and so on.
  Negative
Learning which elements or attacks to use on specific enemies was crucial to my success in battle.
  Negative
Walloping an enemy with an attack it was weak to, like fire or ice, granted my character extra damage and a boost.
  Negative
In this boosted state, special attacks cost nothing; with enough of my party boosted, I could also perform devastating group attacks.
  Negative
The ability to customize your team and your characters so completely is essential to mastering  or more often, struggling to master  Persona Q's high level of difficulty.
  Negative
Even on easy mode, enemies are vicious and puzzles can be mentally draining.
  Negative
In addition to its random battles, Persona Q borrows the concept of FOEs  high-level opponents that often force you to find a way around them or flee  from Etrian Odyssey.
  Negative
FOEs typically play a key component in puzzles: They patrol important paths or chase you as you explore.
  Positive
However difficult they may be, these super-powered enemies feel like fair pressure.
  Negative
With persistence and a lot of swearing, I was always able to find a way to circumvent their presence.
  Positive
Less escapable is the game's mapmaking system, another token from Etrian Odyssey.
  Negative
Although your steps will automatically be recorded as you progress, it's at your discretion to draw in walls, drop icons for doors and chart your journey.
  Positive
It's a process that rewards you for putting in effort   and trust me, you'll want to.
  Positive
Mapmaking was a fun, personal way to mark my time through each dungeon and, in a more functional sense, keep tabs on the game's head-scratching puzzles.
  Positive
I'd drop notes to mark important clues, or use empty space to chart out decoded directions.
  Negative
One of my favorite puzzles required me to first decipher steps through a series of directional clues, mark out the path and then match the area to one already available on my map.
  Negative
Puzzles like this get at the heart of why Persona Q is so great.
  Positive
Everything about the game feels planned out and executed with care and thought.
  Positive
It would have been easy for Atlus to phone it in on Persona Q  to prey on the attachments of players who spent days of playtime with these characters and still crave more.
  Negative
Its plot isn't as in-depth as the ones Persona players have grown used to, but consider it a detour on the road rather than the entire trip itself.
  Negative
Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth defies the idea that a game can be either indulgent or intelligent.
  Negative
It's tailored for lovers of Persona and even Etrian Odyssey, without a doubt.
  Negative
But to call Persona Q nothing more than an appeasement of fans' wants is to diminish one of the richest, most robust dungeon crawlers either franchise has seen in years.
  Negative
here.
  Neutral
