Ruiner asks a difficult question: Are you the ruiner or the ruined?
  Negative
In the year , everything is drenched in crimson  both blood and neon lights.
  Negative
In every corner of the desolate city swarms the broken, exploited, forgotten, tossed aside by Heaven, a megacorporation looking to score big off cheap labor  not unlike that of replicants from Blade Runner.
  Negative
Now more robotic than human, you are instructed to infiltrate and terminate Heaven by completing a simple task: KILL BOSS.
  Negative
Ruiner places you behind the helmet of a nameless, robotic assassin affectionately called Puppy and a host of other derogatory terms whose goal is to eradicate Heaven.
  Neutral
The bland narrative, punishing bosses, and inconsistent performance leave Ruiner a cyberpunk tale with lofty ambitions thats blinded by its own neon lights.
  Very negative
Ruiner does an excellent job at world-building: From the cramped, overflowing city streets to the dilapidated, drug-infested alleyways, its apparent that a massive, corrupt corporation is strangling Rengkok, a retro-futuristic rendition of Bangkok evidently influenced by Blade Runners Los Angeles.
  Neutral
However, the games writing is painfully, predictably clich from the moment that the first boss utters a tired They made me do it line before being killed.
  Neutral
Another boss touts the ever-expected We arent that different, you and I sentiment.
  Negative
Hell, even the final boss says some variation of Lets finish this, once and for all and Ill show you true suffering.
  Negative
With dialogue like this, Ruiners narrative lands in the territory of mediocre at best and forgettable at worst.
  Negative
The games solid combat and smooth controls make up for the deficiency in its storytelling, though.
  Positive
Ruiner is an isometric, twin-stick shooter with a sprinkle of bullet-hell for added difficulty and stress, where commitment and precision are key to survival.
  Negative
Turning has a noticeable weight; you have to follow through with each action on your path to completing a goal.
  Negative
Theres no latency between button presses and character action, meaning the game will almost always respond in an accurate and timely manner.
  Negative
And since Ruiner can get rather difficult rather quickly, frame count and responsiveness can be the difference between retrying the level and an S rating.
  Positive
And S ratings net more karma.
  Positive
Karma, Ruiners stand-in for experience points, is spent on leveling up Puppy as you traipse through the games  districts.
  Negative
Character leveling makes thematic sense here, as skills operate like mod installations, allowing you to swap mods and skill points on the fly and tailor the characters feel to the situation.
  Negative
The idea of freely changing skills is novel  especially considering the cyberpunk theme  but some skills are far more practical and useful than others.
  Negative
Take Ghost Break, the ability to hack enemies to fight for you, unlocked at level .
  Negative
On its surface, this sounds like a compelling skill that would make many of the boss fights a little less suffocating.
  Negative
In practice, however, its absolutely worthless, as hacking requires more time than the game allows in many scenarios.
  Negative
Ghost Break can eventually be upgraded to decrease hacking time, but by that time I had already put my skill points into the Dash, Resource Optimizer and Use Of Weapons mods, which were more practical and had tangible effects in  game.
  Negative
Couple this with the lackluster skill options further down the skill tree, and I found myself sticking to mods that increased my energy and health pools instead.
  Negative
And youll be modifying Puppy frequently to better take on the incessant waves of enemies and bosses.
  Negative
Some bosses in Ruiner are literally electrifying, like TrafficKing, a hovering, severed head that requires you to shoot energy generators to short-circuit his hovercraft in order to deal damage while avoiding his bullet storm.
  Negative
Unfortunately, most other bosses are bullet sponges with screen-length health bars; bullet sponges that, more often than not, end up summoning more waves of enemies to help send you to the dog pound.
  Negative
These are frustrating, often multi-try bouts where challenge is immediately replaced by cheap difficulty and enemies with pixel-perfect accuracy.
  Negative
It becomes less about skill and more about luck, which left me exasperated when the boss quickly wrecked me time and time again.
  Negative
One boss in particular, Mother, is excruciatingly frustrating, as she fires a powerful laser beam that ate through both my energy and health pools multiple times on the first encounter, killing me immediately.
  Negative
And she appears three times in Ruiner, meaning she drained my existence almost instantaneously multiple times throughout the games eight-hour runtime.
  Negative
Its in the chaotic, unending waves of enemies and the aggravating boss encounters where Ruiners performance begins to suffer.
  Negative
While the game runs smoothly the majority of the time, the frame rate tends to dip as the screen fills with special effects, drastically affecting your survivability.
  Positive
In one instance, the game froze temporarily, only to abruptly kill me.
  Negative
In another instance, the game inexplicably crashed, forcing me to reboot Steam altogether in order to restart.
  Negative
While the checkpoint system is forgiving enough, having to replay sections because of game performance is frustrating as hell.
  Very negative
By the time I fought Mother for the third and last time, I was prepared to throw my controller because of how quickly she evaporated my energy and health bars the first two times.
  Negative
Ruiner is one of those games that is unabashedly difficult for the sake of being difficult.
  Negative
It demands you face waves upon waves of the same enemies and mini-bosses before you can even see the final, incredibly trite cinematic.
  Neutral
Are you the ruiner or the ruined?
  Negative
I wont spoil the answer that the game offers up, but I will say that I sure didnt feel triumphant when I finally set the controller down.
  Positive
