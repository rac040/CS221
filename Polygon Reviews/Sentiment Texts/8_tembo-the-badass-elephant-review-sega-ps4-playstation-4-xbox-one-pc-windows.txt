Developed by Game Freak  that is, the same Game Freak responsible for the Pokemon franchise  and published by Sega, Tembo quickly elevates itself above its first impressions.
  Neutral
Like Sega's classic D platforming franchise, Sonic the Hedgehog, this is a game about speed and momentum.
  Negative
Tembo the Badass Elephant is a game that unrepentantly draws on the DNA of Sonic the Hedgehog, it does so while also learning from all of Sonic's greatest flaws.
  Negative
It opens itself to a wider and more discerning audience by way of smart level design and a wonderfully quirky visual style.
  Very positive
Tembo the Badass Elephant follows a trail of destruction left by the titular pachyderm, a wild animal recruited into a war against an evil military force called PHANTOM.
  Negative
Tembo's mission is to cause chaos by running down enemies and rescuing prisoners of war.

The plot is straightforward in a way that matches the simplicity of the gameplay.
  Neutral
Tembo has a very limited arsenal of moves.
  Negative
Holding down one button causes the elephant to dash forward, which can take out unprotected enemies on its own.
  Negative
Tapping up or down while holding the dash button causes Tembo to smash into the air or slam down onto the ground, respectively.
  Negative
Tembo's only non-destructive option is the ability to spray water from his trunk, putting out fires and temporarily shorting out electrified obstacles.
  Negative
With a fairly small move set, Tembo relies on smart level and encounter design to shine.
  Positive
It delivers in this respect as well.
  Very positive
PHANTOM soldiers come in a huge variety of types, including tanks, helicopters and giant mech suits.
  Neutral
Each type requires different strategies to take them down, often also challenging Tembo to dodge fireballs or bolts of electricity as he approaches.
  Negative
The levels housing these enemies mostly follow a linear path from beginning to end, but there are often many short branches and hidden areas to explore for completionists hoping to rescue every prisoner of war and kill every PHANTOM soldier.
  Negative
A note here: "kill" may sound like a harsh word for such a cheerful, cartoony game.
  Negative
When Tembo runs down an enemy, they disappear in a puff of smoke and a skull symbol, floating to the heavens as your "enemy defeated" counter ticks one higher.
  Negative
You can interpret that as you want; in my mind, those PHANTOM scum were not just knocked out.
  Negative
Those levels and all of the enemies and allies inhabiting them are also beautifully animated.
  Very positive
In screenshots, Tembo the Badass Elephant can look kind of cheap and flat.
  Negative
In motion, though, it's fluid and fast, a personality-filled cartoon come to life.
  Positive
Still images just don't do it justice.
  Negative
None of this is revolutionary, but the immediate reactiveness of Tembo's controls ensured that I felt like a master when I was able to string my moves into a lengthy combo of destruction.
  Negative
The brilliance of Tembo lies in how it facilitates two separate types of gameplay perfectly.
  Positive
If you want to take things slow and steady, exploring levels to find every collectible and strategically tackling each enemy, the game will allow that.
  Negative
If you'd rather plow through the levels recklessly, smashing through everything in your path and trying to complete each zone in the shortest time possible, this is both allowed and encouraged via the dash button.
  Negative
And frankly, while I often found the former strategy more in line with my pace of play, the latter felt incredible as I memorized levels and was able to blow through them.
  Negative
It's odd, then, that Tembo the Badass Elephant maintains a couple of confusing systems that purposefully slow things down.
  Negative
Like many platformers, progression is split into levels, which themselves are placed into four distinct "worlds."
  Negative
The last couple of levels in each world are locked behind a goal  a set number of PHANTOM soldiers that you need to find and destroy in the previous levels.
  Negative
These goals aren't hard to attain generally, but on a couple of occasions I was forced to return to old areas and hunt down foes that I missed in the far corners of the levels.
  Very negative
Likewise, Tembo utilizes a strangely old-school "life" system, where the elephant collects peanuts to crush into peanut butter, which revives him after death.
  Positive
Every  peanuts will grant you an extra life, which allows you to begin at a checkpoint when you die, rather than restarting the level entirely.
  Positive
Levels are long and complex enough that you're going to want this option, especially on initial runs as you're still learning the layout.
  Neutral
I was rarely able to stick it out through a whole level if I went in with only one or two lives.
  Negative
In a concession to this frustration, Tembo will refill you to five lives when you hit zero and get knocked out of a level.
  Negative
But if you want more than that, you're left to return to easier levels and farm peanuts for as long as you can stand it.
  Negative
Five was usually more than enough for me, but it was annoying needing to go into a level with only a couple lives, drop them and then return to the start with my refreshed stack.
  Negative
The life system just doesn't add to the sense of accomplishment provided by other areas in the game.
  Negative
Even when I was forced back into levels I had already conquered, Tembo rarely lost its momentum.
  Negative
In the eight hours I spent as an elephant soldier, I never felt like the game's flow was interrupted.
  Negative
Tembo the Badass Elephant is a direction I never would have expected Game Freak to go in, and it would feel redundant coming from Sega, if it wasn't so damn good at improving in the areas where Sega has failed.
  Very negative
But however this strange beast came into being, I'm glad it was given the chance to exist.
  Negative
here.
