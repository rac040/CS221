Pyre is, I feel comfortable saying, unlike anything I have ever played before.
  Positive
Pyres Supergiant lineage in its top-down perspective and lush, animated visual style.
  Positive
You can hear it in the limited but memorable voice-over work by Logan Cunningham and gorgeous music from Darren Korb.
  Positive
Beyond these surface similarities, however, little else feels familiar.
  Negative
Though Bastion and Transistor had their own quirks, they both easily fit the confines of the action-RPG genre.
  Positive
Pyre is something else entirely.
  Neutral
It rests at a crossroads between fantasy adventure, sports game and visual novel.
  Positive
It feels new, in a way I can rarely say about even the best games, and that newness is intoxicating.
  Very positive
Pyre assigns you the role of a nameless, faceless character known only as the Reader.
  Neutral
You have been exiled from your home in the Commonwealth, where literacy is banned; now you join a small but growing band of weary travelers known as Nightwings in a dangerous, purgatorial land known as the Downside.
  Negative
However, by performing a series of sacred rites  rites that you, as a Reader, preside over  you and the Nightwings have the possibility of winning your freedom.
  Neutral
It is within these rites that Pyre reveals its most singular mechanics.
  Neutral
The rites themselves are a competition between two teams of three, each vying for their chance to return to the Commonwealth with crimes forgiven.
  Negative
The teams are placed on opposite ends of a small map, each with a flame the titular pyre.
  Negative
A ball of energy appears on the map between the two teams, and your goal is to grab the ball, plunge it into their flame and keep doing so until the enemy teams pyre has been doused entirely.
  Very negative
Theres a lot more going on here than it appears at first.
  Neutral
Operating like a magical form of basketball mixed with a MOBA, the rites reveal their depth slowly, unlocking new abilities and character types from match to match.
  Positive
First you learn that running enemies into your aura banishes them from the field for a brief time.
  Neutral
Then you learn how to cast your aura forward, banishing opponents in its path.
  Neutral
Then you ,about faster or more powerful characters, about their strengths and weaknesses and about dozens of more minor tweaks on the formula over the course of the games first six hours or so.
  Neutral
Beyond the strategic depth added from each small twist, Pyres moment-to-moment mechanics and gameplay click well.
  Positive
Movement in the game feels good, from zooming around at high speeds to slamming into the middle of the field as a larger character and knocking everyone back.
  Positive
When I pulled off a great play, bouncing the ball between characters before diving into the enemys pyre, it felt incredible.
  Positive
And while matches were never too challenging on Pyres default difficulty, I often found myself in tense, satisfying faceoffs where one last goal on either side stood between victory and defeat.
  Positive
Pyre also offers the ability to tweak the experience to your own liking, beyond just raising or lowering the difficulty level.
  Positive
You can equip talismans on your different players, granting them unique benefits such as the chance of instantly returning to the playing field upon being banished or instantly regaining your stamina whenever you grab the ball.
  Negative
Likewise, as characters spend more time performing rites, they gain experience in the form of enlightenment, ranking up across matches and unlocking special skills that further differentiate them and open up new options.
  Negative
Most players are going to be employing slightly different tactics to make it through rites by the end of the game.
  Negative
If theres one disappointment to Pyre  one I wrestled with throughout my time  its that the core of the gameplay mechanics is just the rites.
  Very negative
Supergiant Games has built up a gorgeous world full of intriguing backstory and tons of locales, and at times I just wanted to  explore it.
  Positive
Sadly, moving from location to location is an automated process: You choose where to go on a map, and then you watch your wagon move there.
  Negative
The game provides an extremely tiny view of its world, but just enough that I wanted to spend more time there.
  Positive
Much of the pull of this world is delivered through Pyres narrative, which drives the game forward in spite of the repetition of its sports game-style core.
  Negative
Sharply written dialogue is interspersed between rites, illuminating a story that branches in dozens of different ways.
  Very positive
That plot is carried on the shoulders of a wonderful cast of characters  party members such as the gruff demon Jodariel, the bitter bog witch Bertrude and my personal favorite, Sir Gilman, a snake with a single large eye who wears a clunky metal helmet and wants nothing more than to be an honorable knight.
  Negative
These characters are supremely likable, and theyre developed through both the main plot and dozens of optional conversations that you can hold between rites.
  Positive
As you journey from the location of one rite to the next, youll be forced to make countless tiny decisions.
  Negative
Some are as simple as which path to take, which can determine whether you find a hidden treasure or gain a stat bonus; other choices are harder and have further-reaching consequences, like whether or not you trust a new party member.
  Negative
Pyre crosses over from traditional multipath narrative game into truly brilliant with one major design element: You cannot lose the game.
  Positive
If you fail in a rite, your journey simply continues.
  Negative
If one of your opponents gains freedom in place of your own exiles, you simply have to accept that result and its impact on the plot, and keep going.
  Positive
And at times, the game tugs at your heartstrings in ways that might make you want to lose.
  Negative
Is it worth it to gain freedom for one more of your exiles?
  Positive
Or do you want to hand the victory over to a kindly old man whos been seeking a way out of the Downside his whole life?
  Neutral
Do you want to free Jodariel, or would you rather gain favor with another flighty teammate by allowing her estranged sister to win?
  Negative
The game forces you into numerous rites where youre struggling not just to determine a winning strategy for the match itself but to decide what the right choice is ethically.
  Positive
I wont spoil too much about Pyres story and where it goes, but I will say that the numerous branching paths pay off, with an ending that lets you view how each and every major character you met along the way ends up.
  Negative
While I dont know when Ill find the time to sink  to  hours into another playthrough, I absolutely want to  if only to try to get all my favorite characters into better positions by the end, or see what happens if the Nightwings never manage to win a match.
  Negative
Between that fascinating, open-ended approach to storytelling and its totally unique core gameplay, Supergiant Games pursued a vision for something new with Pyre, and the company has largely succeeded.
  Very positive
Fans expecting more of the same may have to fight through some disappointment  especially if they want to be able to more thoroughly explore the nooks and crannies of the Downside.
  Negative
But Pyre makes a worthwhile trade-off here, exchanging the familiar for the fantastical.
  Positive
