Batman: The Telltale Series is a game about Bruce Wayne.
  Positive
gorilla in the Batman-based video games room: Rocksteady's Arkham series, lauded for its overall design, engaging combat and smorgasbord approach to Batman's extensive cast of characters.
  Very positive
But as an avid fan who's grown uncertain in the last year of Rocksteady's ability to consistently tell a good Batman story, I saw inBatman: The Telltale Series the tantalizing potential of a very different, story-first experience.
  Negative
premiered at The Game Awards last December, the only information it held was that it was a game about Batman from Telltale Games: a choice-driven Batman game played primarily through conversations and dialogue.
  Negative
And maybe, I hoped, a game where solving mysteries was more complex than holding down a button to automatically identify blood spatter with your computerized HUD.
  Negative
the best Batman comic ever is one that proves that Bruce Wayne is as important to Gotham as Batman is.
  Very positive
As with the first issue of a comic, there's plenty that remains to be seen.
  Negative
But Batman: The Telltale Series is off to a solid start.
  Negative
This review will follow the series as it develops, with updates as each chapter arrives detailing the current state of the game.
  Negative
With all the Batman world as their playground, the folks at Telltale have chosen to root their game in the early history of the character.
  Negative
District attorney Harvey Dent Travis Willingham is running for mayor against the corrupt incumbent Hamilton Hill.
  Negative
Bruce Wayne Troy Baker is Dent's biggest backer and best spokesman, while mobster Carmine Falcone Richard McGonagle is complicating the whole thing with his clear desire to get his money and his control in on the ground floor of a new city administration.
  Positive
Meanwhile, an expert cat burglar has been making high-profile heists in Gotham, Bruce's childhood friend Oz is unexpectedly back from a long exile, and the police are at odds with the vigilante known as the Batman.
  Positive
But at least one cop, James Gordon Murphy Guyer, seems to have accepted him as a tentative ally.
  Negative
For the attentive nerd, the game is pulling from a mix of ideas, and I was a little surprised at just how recent some of the referenced comic details were, like the use of a white rose as Falcone's personal symbol and calling card.
  Negative
As far as I know, that detail first appeared in Batman Eternal, a comic that's a mere two years old.
  Positive
I was pleasantly surprised to find that Batman: The Telltale Series builds on Telltale's usual exploratory gameplay wander around, examine environmental features, read flavor text or discover objectives to create a detective mode that asks the player to do at least some of the intuitive lifting.
  Positive
It might only have made one appearance in "Realm of Shadows," but I hope it's a recurring mechanic.
  Negative
Batman films are rarely mysteries, usually because the audience already knows who the villain is from the advertisements.
  Positive
And it's hard to feel like the World's Greatest Detective while you're just pointing your reticle at telegraphed waypoints, scanning, rinsing and repeating.
  Negative
Batman: The Telltale Series jazzes up the company's usual combat mechanics as well, instituting a finishing move meter that fills as you successfully complete a fight scene's quick-time events, until you unleash a suitably Batman-esque closer to the challenge.
  Positive
This gives the player a reason to strive for martial perfection other than the obvious  because, really, even if you do miss a press of a button, it's not like Batman's going to get cold-cocked by some low-level mook.
  Very negative
That would just be silly.
  Neutral
There's even a bit where "Realm of Shadows" combines both the game's detective and combat features into a single event that has the player essentially choreographing a whole fight scene under the guise of Batman planning ... well.
  Positive
I should stop before I say too much.
  Negative
you can't keep doing this" before?
  Negative
and the story takes a while to get to interesting places.
  Neutral
But after the slow start, the social situations you find yourself in start to take on weight and tension.
  Negative
The conversational gameplay, and the writing, shines most when characters are locked in battles of will with an added level of intrigue as in a certain scene between Bruce and Selina Kyle.
  Positive
Telltale's Bruce Wayne also has an easy, wry sense of humor, even in unguarded moments with Alfred.
  Positive
That took me a while to get used to, as my mental version of Batman is stoic to the last, but when I did, I found that I much appreciated it  it was a large part of what made those scenes flow.
  Negative
By the end of "Realm of Shadows," Batman: The Telltale Series raises the stakes for players who are already pretty familiar with saving Gotham City by paying attention to character over plot, crafting a climax that's deeply personal for Bruce Wayne.
  Neutral
The cliffhanger ending hits some good emotional notes, even if the game never quite stops having a clunker of a line every scene or so.
  Positive
Overall, the game's big choices boil down to optics  what Christopher Nolan's Ra's al Ghul might call "theatricality."
  Neutral
How do you want Gotham's wary citizens or superstitious criminals to view Batman and Bruce Wayne?
  Neutral
What about James Gordon, Carmine Falcone or Selina Kyle?
  Neutral
Does your Bruce Wayne play the moneyed dunce in public, or the brooding orphan?
  Neutral
Does your Batman work with cops, or in spite of them?
  Neutral
Does your hero torture?
  Negative
And how does he act around those who already know his secret?
  Neutral
These are questions at the heart of every Batman adaptation, whether it's a film, game, or even comic book reboot or relaunch.
  Negative
Telltale puts them in the hands of the player.
  Neutral
diverged too far from my own.
  Negative
Clunky bits of dialogue and sleepy start notwithstanding, Batman: The Telltale Series, a game about Bruce Wayne, might just make me feel like I am Batman.
  Negative
What is the most central idea of Batman?
  Neutral
Its that after watching the death of his parents in an act of random violence, Bruce Wayne pledged his life to the battle against crime in all its forms, in the futile but undying hope that no innocent person in Gotham City would ever again meet his parents fate.
  Negative
The second episode of Batman: The Telltale Series kicks off by drilling down on its first episodes cliffhanger reveal: Thomas and Martha Wayne werent exactly who he thought they were.
  Negative
The games writers are by no means the first to reveal heretofore unknown details about Bruce Waynes childhood in order to make the reader, and Bruce, consider his origin in a new light.
  Negative
And when when youre talking about a character with  years of history, thats not a criticism; its an inevitability.
  Negative
In fact, for a while I assumed that the whole thing would eventually be revealed as an elaborate sham  because thats exactly what was going on when writer Grant Morrison introduced similar ideas into his run on Batman in as recently as   but Alfred confirms it in the episodes first scene: the Waynes were friendly with some of Gothams less reputable set.
  Negative
This is a bold choice, but one with meat on it for Telltale to use.
  Positive
The realization that your parents are just humans and not the lionized, omnipotent figures you always thought they were is a familiar emotion.
  Negative
And, after all, Telltale doesnt have to eventually return its Batman story to the status quo so that the next editorial team can take over in  to  issues.
  Negative
The studio is free to do whatever it wants to the canon.
  Neutral
But ultimately, "Children of Arkham" doesnt really execute on the idea properly, either thematically or logistically.
  Negative
Comic books require a certain amount of suspension of belief, sure, but the player is expected to believe that Bruce only now remembers vital details of his parents murder  after spending more than  years building a vigilante career based on being unable to move past that precise moment  and that the Worlds Greatest Detective never noticed the documents in his familys files that tied them to Gothams corrupt politics and criminal element.
  Negative
As a second episode in a five-episode series, its reasonable for "Arkham" to lack the exciting oomph of being introduced to new versions of familiar characters, and to broadly feel like its still setting up challenges for Batman to knock down  without anyone too important actually being knocked down.
  Negative
But its also reasonable for the player to expect fun stuff to chew on in the meantime.
  Positive
The second episode does improve upon the firsts dialogue; I dont think I groaned once at an overwritten or overacted line well, I might have gotten a little tired of the Penguins accent.
  Negative
But its also more dialogue-heavy, with fewer puzzles, exploration or introduction of new mechanics, than its predecessor.
  Negative
That said, there is one fascinating new choice.
  Positive
"Children of Arkham" offers you two options when accomplishing a single plot point: Show up as Batman and get all growly, or show up as Bruce Wayne and see where charm and influence can get you.
  Positive
Still, the one I picked didnt seem to have an effect on the story, just my own player experience.
  Negative
It isnt the only major choice that feels a little divorced from the rest of the episode.
  Negative
"Children of Arkham" opens by asking a question  were the Waynes fatally mugged, or is there more to their deaths than Bruce realized  and the ensuing thrust of the plot follows Bruces attempts to find the answer.
  Negative
Episode  also demanded answers of the player  How does Bruce Wayne want Gotham to see his legacy?
  Negative
And how does Batman want to be seen by cops, criminals and the public?
  Negative
and that was reinforced through narrative and choice mechanics in the episodes climax.
  Neutral
"Children of Arkham" answers its question in its finale, but doesnt give an opportunity to act on that answer, or even to engage in how its revealed.
  Negative
Instead, my big final choice was, I suppose, loosely connected to the episodes B-plot about Bruces relationships with his friends a distant emotional second to our main character wrestling with information that would make sense of his parents insensible death  and might invalidate his lifelong crusade.
  Negative
Still, the episodes final big choice was one I immediately quit the game to replay  because, as a comic book fan, I couldnt believe it was a variable that Telltale would want to leave to the player.
  Negative
Im extremely interested to see how the effect of that particular turning point plays out as the story continues.
  Negative
Episode  of Batman: The Telltale Series continues a solid start to a Telltale game through to a solid middle, neither raising nor lowering the bar for the episodes that come after it.
  Positive
Though it has fun splashes of character work alongside its big comic book emotions, it rarely surprises.
  Positive
Serial media, whether its a podcast, a television show, a comic or a Telltale game, has to treat its individual installments as complete chunks of story in and of themselves.
  Negative
Ultimately, Episode s arc is a little too loose.
  Negative
If Episode  of Batman: The Telltale Series, "Children of Arkham," was still writing checks after Episode , Episode  starts cashing them.
  Positive
Batman: The Telltale Series promised us a game about Bruce Wayne, and "New World Order" is the episode that delivers best on that idea so far  and accomplishes the most.
  Positive
About halfway through Batmans latest installment, I realized that I hadnt seen a combat sequence in a while, and also that it had taken me quite a while to notice that I hadnt seen a combat sequence in a while.
  Negative
"New World Order" is packed with tension whether or not anybodys wearing a cape.
  Negative
I was consistently drawn into conversations where, as Bruce, I had to act based on knowledge I gained as Batman without showing my hand.
  Negative
Its the sort of split second decision making that even made a conversation about a corporate board vote interesting.
  Positive
When the episode winds toward its climax, theres not a pointed ear or inch of kevlar in sight, and it still delivers the best cliffhanger ending of the series so far.
  Positive
The finale of "Children of Arkham," contained several events that play a large role in determining the major threads of "New World Order."
  Negative
A traumatized Harvey Dent is now in the mayors seat.
  Neutral
The Children of Arkham have revealed themselves and their mission to tear down Gothams interconnected political, criminal and financial elite, creating a clear, powerful enemy for Batman.
  Negative
Additionally, they tarnished Bruces family name, leading many members of the Wayne Tech board to question his suitability as the companys figurehead.
  Negative
Its no wonder you spend so much time as Bruce Wayne, really  his best friend is on a swift slide down into supervillainy, his company is being taken away from him, and hes just found out his father wasnt at all what he thought he was.
  Very negative
Managing all that and still having time to foil the latest Children of Arkham plot is why this is the guy is Batman  and not the guy wearing hockey pads.
  Negative
relatively recently  been roughly mishandled when writers decide to view her primarily through the lens of her romantic interest in with Batman, and, inevitably, through the lens of her sexual appeal to the straight, male viewer.
  Negative
Telltale has decided to wade into those well-trod waters with "New World Order," and I found myself surprised both at how far the game was comfortable going and at how dexterously it performed when it got there.
  Positive
Certainly, Batman: The Telltale Series detective mechanic felt like it was wearing itself thin with a patently obvious mystery drawn out by fiddling with points and lines this time around  and an early choice in the episode seemed to be set up to have dire consequences and turned out to be a bit of a blip.
  Negative
But the the writing steps up in a big way in "New World Order," in dialogue, plot and character, and in the end it viciously one-two-punches the player with a major reveal and a hard cut to cliffhanger.
  Negative
Were more than halfway through Batman: The Telltale Series, and it feels like were starting to see the best of it.
  Negative
youve watched the trailer, you know that "Guardian of Gotham" features a pale, green-haired, laughing inmate.
  Negative
So I dont want to hear anybody crying spoiler when I say that Telltales interpretation of the Joker is rather good.
  Negative
attempt to explain him, and Telltale does not fall into the trap, giving the Joker a place and a history in their version of the Batman mythos that raises as many questions as it gives answers.
  Negative
The player gets plenty of time to interact with "John" in his natural habitat during the episodes high point and the series first significant look at Arkham Asylum.
  Negative
In a lot of ways, Episode s "Arkham interlude" is a vacation from the rest of the story  for good and for ill.
  Negative
Its fun to have a chance to interact with a bunch of NPCs, and its especially interesting to watch Bruce Wayne and a pre-Joker Joker interact; neither of them having any idea of the titanic clashes in their shared future.
  Positive
But just like taking a vacation, the interlude is soon and abruptly over  and its the first thing that happens in the episode.
  Negative
Everything that comes after feels like waiting for the other shoe to drop  which is to be expected, given that this is the penultimate chapter in Batman: The Telltale Series.
  Negative
Things are starting to get very bad in Gotham City, and several scenes in succession illustrate for us.
  Negative
And for the first time since Episode , things get very bad even without the direct influence of the shadowy Children of Arkham.
  Negative
This is honestly a bit annoying; after Episode s surprise reveal of the true identity of the organizations leader, we see neither hide nor hair of them except a replica in Batmans fancy augmented reality detective setup.
  Very negative
Episode  packs most of its compelling character work into its early Arkham scenes, then tosses it to the wind to get all the pieces in place for Episode   and theres no direct indication that the Arkham stuff will remain relevant as the first season of Batman: The Telltale Series comes to a close.
  Negative
"Guardian of Gotham" doesnt disappoint with its climactic player choice, though, giving the player a clear, high stakes decision regarding Bruces two lives.
  Positive
Telltale has warned players that regardless of what they select, Episode s final choice will dramatically impact the course of Episode , and when you get to it, its not hard to understand how.
  Negative
Batman: The Telltale Series fifth episode has its moments, but ultimately  like Episode   its doing more heavy lifting for the end of the series than it is for the story of its own discrete installment.
  Negative
Fortunately, from everything we see in "Guardian of Gotham," it seems like that ending is going to be worth it.
  Positive
Back in August, I felt that Batman: The Telltale Series might be a game that made me feel like I was Batman.
  Negative
It succeeded in doing something subtly different, but just as exciting.
  Positive
If the season overall has been uneven, at least it has used its more lackluster episodes "Children of Arkham," "Guardian of Gotham" to set up sizable highs in narrative stakes and meaty character writing in the follow-ups.
  Negative
Which is to say: Episode , "City of Light" kicks off with a bang and doesnt let up until its climax in the gothic catacombs of Arkham Asylum.
  Negative
The player's final choice in Episode , "Guardian of Gotham," determines which challenge they face in the early third of "City of Light."
  Positive
That meant that I was up against a fully deranged Harvey Dent in the process of burning Wayne Manor to the ground.
  Neutral
But rather than throwing me directly into the action, Batman: The Telltale Series takes a moment to remind me  a savvy nerd whod been waiting patiently for Harvey's descent into madness since the moment he was introduced  exactly what was at stake here for Bruce Wayne.
  Negative
A flashback of Bruce and Harvey planning the bright future of Gotham together is directly contrasted with a gun-waving Harvey in the scorched and gutted fixtures of the manor  and that's just the title sequence.
  Negative
What follows, and what it asks of the player, is as moving as some of the best versions of Two-Face's origin story out there.
  Positive
in adaptation, not comics?
  Neutral
Now that Batman: The Telltale Series has reached its conclusion complete with a post-plot stinger for what could come next in another season, it's possible to speak not just of its story as a whole, but of its mechanics.
  Negative
The game's final fight planning sequence ups the ante from previous episodes by containing timed choices, a twist that feels very Batman.
  Negative
But the series' take on crime scene investigation, while promising, never quite reached the height I wanted it to.
  Negative
It's far too easy to get through these sequences by process of elimination rather than intuitive thinking.
  Negative
A few red herrings would go a long way.
  Negative
Still, the detective sequences in "City of Light" have an urgency that those in other episodes have lacked, as Batman investigates an ongoing crime rather than reconstructing a cold crime scene.
  Negative
All of the character arcs set up by other episodes come to a head, and the finale uses them to lean hard into the games overall themes, perhaps more consistently than any other installment of the series.
  Positive
Every one of our big bads is inches from achieving their Big Bad Goal.
  Negative
And if ruining Bruce Wayne's life and legacy isn't a huge part of their plans, it's at least a happy coincidence.
  Positive
If youre a seasoned Batman reader, the question of "Who is really the mask, Batman or Bruce Wayne?"
  Neutral
has been answered so often as to render it old hat.
  Negative
In any case, the answer is always "Bruce Wayne," as if the irony of a superheros secret identity being the true mask hadnt worn off a dozen repetitions ago.
  Negative
"City of Light" sets itself apart in that it allows the player to approach that question however they want.
  Positive
That includes ways that dont presuppose that there are only two possible answers.
  Negative
The truth is that Batman is at his strongest as a character when his true nature is somewhere in between that binary.
  Positive
"Gotham's most eligible bachelor" is a mask, but so is "Gotham's growling, unstoppable vigilante."
  Negative
Between those two is a person that only those closest to Bruce get to see.
  Neutral
I began this review series by wondering if it "might just make me feel like I am Batman."
  Negative
By the end, something even better happened: I figured out how to properly be Bruce Wayne.
  Positive
I couldn't be happier with that conclusion.
  Negative
here.
  Neutral
