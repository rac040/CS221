Big is best, especially if youre small.
  Positive
The transformation from teensy to towering is a common fantasy among children, a microcosmic representation of the magical process theyre actually going through.
  Positive
Kids love dinosaurs, monster trucks and gargantuan robots.
  Neutral
In adults, rapid growth is a useful metaphor for the revenge of the powerless.
  Negative
The little guy who makes it big.
  Neutral
Knack s core concept of a tiny little chap who can grow into a giant is attractive.
  Neutral
a disappointment.
  Very negative
Many criticisms at the time were levied against how poorly it exercised the central character's biggest attraction of being, well, big.
  Negative
It was also repetitive and soulless.
  Very negative
a decent development schedule for Knack , hes avoided many of the problems that plagued Knacks design.
  Negative
This time around, Knack gets to spend a lot of his time being the big guy.
  Negative
In Knack , bad goblins are energizing long dead robots in order to conquer and destroy the world of humans.
  Negative
Knack and a small band of human sidekicks set out to thwart the goblins.
  Positive
This quest takes them on a journey to a variety of locations, from lush forest to modern city to factory complex.
  Positive
Geographic diversity is standard fare for the arcade platform genre.
  Negative
Its pretty clear why such lavish variety is deemed necessary.
  Positive
In practice, each level is really much of a muchness.
  Negative
Knack  does not entirely avoid the problem of repetition, but its made a good fist attempt of at least trying to mitigate this generic problem.
  Negative
Heres the general rhythm of the game: Knack, at around human size, enters and fights low level guards.
  Negative
He makes himself small and penetrates the inner workings of an installation via pipes and platforms.
  Positive
He goes back to being normal size fighting his way through rooms and corridors.
  Negative
He solves physical puzzles.
  Positive
He smashes crates in order to find junk relics that make him gradually grow to  and  feet tall.
  Negative
Previously onerous enemies are swept aside with ease.
  Positive
At some point, he encounters a giant boss, or lots of smaller bosses, or both.
  Negative
He also seeks out raw materials that he can use as defensive shields, or as currency for combat upgrades and new moves.
  Negative
Along the way, he'll transform back to smallness where necessary, usually to get through some barrier.
  Negative
Puzzles present themselves on a regular beat.
  Positive
They often involve moving a box from one place to another to create a jumping point.
  Positive
Weight puzzles are also common, complexified slightly by Knacks ability to incorporate other materials into his body, like ice and iron.
  Negative
These give him special abilities that mix up the puzzle mechanics.
  Neutral
Generally speaking, the puzzles are fun, if slightly repetitive.
  Negative
This is a world of moving parts, and so Knack often finds himself facing platforms that wheel through nasty impediments, like noxious gas blasts, stomping vices and giant rolling rocks.
  Negative
These are all realtime exercises in watching kinetic patterns, something I enjoy.
  Positive
There is a smooth exactness about his movements, an essential element in platform games.
  Positive
As I play, I have no control over the camera, which reels and pans according to the developers direction.
  Negative
I seem to have spent the last few years playing games with camera control, so this took me a bit of getting used to.
  Negative
On some occasions, the camera is placed weirdly, making platform moves frustrating.
  Negative
But on the whole, it seems to work.
  Positive
Knack s platform-puzzle formulas are an amalgam of decades of evolution in platform games.
  Neutral
Yes, they are familiar, but their familiarity is also manifested in the variety of things to do.
  Neutral
This game is a bit like those old compendiums of board games, like chess, checkers and dominoes.
  Negative
You know what you're getting, but it's still kind of neat to have them all in one package.
  Positive
Knack  is a scripted, linear experience.
  Negative
I work my way through its puzzles the exact same way as any other player, seeing all the same things.
  Negative
On the other hand, the combat system offers plenty of individuality.
  Positive
At the beginning of the game Knacks moves are basically punch, kick, swerve and block.
  Negative
Over the course of the game, these are augmented considerably.
  Negative
Via an upgrade tree, or through narrative gifts, he learns to body slam and to hook enemies.
  Negative
The swerve adds a punch.
  Positive
The punch adds multiple punches, which are later improved further into ultimate punches.
  Positive
Individual attack moves are two-button affairs, easy to pull off, but powerful when combined with defensive moves, or the ubiquitous swerve, which is the most essential move, by far, especially on more difficult modes.
  Positive
Quite often, the best way to defeat an enemy is to literally get around it, and kick it in the ass.
  Negative
Knack s best idea is to offer four different levels of difficulty.
  Neutral
Easy and normal will find favor with younger, less experienced players, who ought to be able to get through even the toughest battles without too much trouble.
  Negative
I found the middle sections of the game spiked slightly in difficulty, as Knack encountered tougher enemies before he has won better moves, but not to the point of frustration.
  Negative
Enemies come in a steadily ratcheted variety of difficulty, combining among themselves to create a varied palette of challenges.
  Negative
Ultimately, my health regenerates, while theirs does not.
  Negative
This is the case with the big bosses, whose patterns are pleasingly readable after a few false starts.
  Negative
Despite these big set pieces, Knack spends a lot of time coasting through levels, swiping small posses of enemies aside.
  Negative
Although this offers little challenge, it's also satisfying.
  Positive
He is at his best when he's huge and just smashing stuff up.
  Positive
This is what I've come to see and to be, a giant who stomps his way through life.
  Neutral
It wouldn't do to make a whole game focus on this one pleasure, but Knack  delivers enough of these moments to balance with challenging fights and restful periods of puzzle solving.
  Negative
Once the game is complete, I go back and try different levels at different difficulties.
  Negative
I can also replay the whole game with all the powers I've earned in the first play-through, which is great fun.
  Very positive
And there's a neat co-op mode in which two players combine to deliver special moves, like creating explosions or launching one another at the enemy.
  Positive
I played this mode with one of my kids and we had a blast.
  Positive
Its interesting to me that Cerny is an engineer at heart.
  Positive
He worked as lead architect on PlayStation .
  Negative
So it's no surprise that the best parts of Knack  are those that are specifically systems-based, such as the exactitude of its platforming sections and the quality of its combat mechanics.
  Negative
Combat moves and platform sequences are all delivered, shining and smelling agreeably of grease.
  Positive
I found one gameplay bug, but other than that, Knack  is polished and highly competent.
  Positive
But the story is a different matter.
  Neutral
It's atrocious.
  Negative
No cliche is left alone; all are dragged into the sunlight, screaming for mercy.
  Very negative
The dialog comes at me like a s sci-fi short.
  Negative
Villains actually rock back their heads and declare that you are about to "meet your doom."
  Positive
If it's supposed to be ironic, it's not ironic enough, especially for a generation of kids saturated in irony.
  Negative
The human sidekicks spend most action sequences literally standing in the background.
  Negative
As the game moves on, they are given narrative roles that augment two-dimensional personalities and trite relationship conflicts.
  Negative
One character is there to provide comic relief, but he's not funny.
  Negative
The whole story feels like it was written by a bunch of scientists who crammed "The Hero With a Thousand Faces" and binge-watched Spielberg movies.
  Negative
The plot slings itself forward through more works of engineering.
  Negative
Problems are solved by building things.
  Neutral
More problems are provided when more things are built.
  Negative
It gets a bit tiresome.
  Negative
Knack himself is a work of engineering, an amalgamation of nuts and bolts.
  Negative
He's a conundrum.
  Positive
Both his parts  tiny and huge have entertainment value, but as a duality, they don't make much sense.
  Neutral
They fail to come together and very little of the games story takes advantage of his split personality.
  Negative
The baby Knack is mute and cute.
  Positive
The big Knack is aggressive and humorless.
  Negative
His eyes constantly have the quality of a man in a TSA line, absolutely certain he's not going to have time to grab that latte on his way to the gate.
  Positive
It's not that I don't like Knack.
  Negative
He has moments of charm.
  Positive
But he's certainly not a classic character.
  Negative
Hes a bit of a dull fellow, really.
  Negative
Knack  is an entertaining platform game like those of yesteryear.
  Positive
It's been created with due care and attention.
  Positive
Sure, its old fashioned, and its story is appalling.
  Negative
But its a reminder that the character-led platform combat game is still alive and well.
  Positive
Despite its good looks, its more a work of engineering than it is a work of art.
  Positive
But, as my kid said to me after we'd mashed our way through a co-op level, it's kinda fun.
  Negative
