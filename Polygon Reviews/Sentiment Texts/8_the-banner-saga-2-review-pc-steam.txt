The ground is rocky and broken, but elements are able to make it seem less dreary.
  Positive
One sequence that brings your caravan into the mines is dark and cramped, but the little bits of light that shine in through the cracks in the rock wall are placed exactly to illuminate your little group hustling.

  Negative

Natural obstacles in the path of characters can block out some of your smaller players, which becomes a bigger problem when you have giant Varl in your party that can block out part of the battlefield with its bulk.
  Negative
The darkness of the Dredge  figures almost entirely clothed in black  also can mess things up when they fade into objects or other characters.
  Negative
However, its easy to forget little annoyances that appear in battle when everything else works to the games aesthetic advantage.
  Neutral
When you come across any of the large, intricate Godstones depicting ancient legends line your path, and as the poet Aleo relates the worlds mythology, it introduces needed bits of hope, as well as a needed break in the action.

  Positive
I often employed a couple Varl, an archer, a raider, and some kind of support, but this could change.

When the horseborn were introduced halfway through the game, I began to utilize their unique skills, whether it was long-distance attacks or their ability to run away following a melee.

There are many new characters to take advantage of, such as Aleo and the horseborn,, but many have been following you since the original Banner Saga.
  Negative

  Negative
I didnt play much of the first game and I think my experience suffered for it.
  Negative
Explanations of its turn-based combat system and the characters are ample enough in Banner Saga  that I felt less lost, but there was always a slight sense of something missing.
  Negative
Many characters, especially ones that were introduced earlier, dont get enough screen time to validate some of their actions.
  Negative
Im not sure if this is due to paths and side stories I may have missed, but some arcs come out of nowhere  including one moment where I was surprised by professions of love from a party member who I didnt interact with at all.
  Negative
Despite a reliance on the first game that often left me somewhat disoriented, The Banner Saga 's narrative drew me in and never really let up.
  Negative
Alette must learn to lead in the immediate aftermath of her fathers death, but those responsibilities present a harsh truth: you can't please everyone.
  Negative
While I hoped the choices I made as I progressed would strengthen my characters, I struggled with forces beyond my characters understanding, and with problems I was powerless to fix.
  Very negative
The lack of manual save points  which I use a lot in choice-making games to see all options  drives this point home.

  Negative
I wanted to tell everyone that it was going to be okay.
  Neutral
The Banner Saga  is familiar enough for those into fantasy, but Stoic manages to craft a complex narrative within those genre conventions.
  Positive
The combat sequences are elaborate enough to provide a sense of depth and reward that tricked me into having fun, but even battles won or choices that seem smart can't prevent things from ending horribly.
  Neutral
Even though I tried to parse together the emotions I felt about the gameplay or the art design, I couldnt get past the despair I felt when the credits began to roll.
  Negative
I didnt like this feeling at all  in fact, I felt terrible  but I cant deny that the game provides powerful storytelling for an emotionally rich experience thats rare to find in any medium.
  Positive
The combination of gameplay, character building, strategy, and narrative highlights the power games have in telling stories, and that experience is uniquely Banner Saga  even if I have to wait until the third installment to see if anything pays off.
  Negative
