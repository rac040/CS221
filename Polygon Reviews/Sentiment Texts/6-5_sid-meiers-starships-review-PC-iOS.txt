Its intention, from the opening cinematic, is to create an epic space opera.
  Very positive
But in execution, it falls in that weird middle-ground of gaming experiences; too long for a single sitting, but too simple to feel truly epic.
  Negative
Instead of being action-packed, it quickly becomes tedious.
  Negative
Rarely have I walked out of a great science fiction movie and thought to myself, "gosh, what an exciting war of attrition."
  Very positive
Starships is essentially a tactical skirmish game with just enough story and metagame to glue the various bits together.
  Negative
Its turn-based space combat takes place hundreds of years after the events of Civilization: Beyond Earth.
  Positive
Your human colony has been at peace for generations, and your society's next great endeavor is to journey among the stars and reunite the many lost tribes of mankind.
  Positive
But your noble, humanitarian mission quickly turns into a military one in the game's opening cinematic.
  Negative
Players take the role of admiral, leading a fleet of mighty warships on a journey from planet to planet.
  Negative
Each neighboring world has their own desperate needs, and each it seems want your help fighting off pirates or an advanced artificial intelligence that has gone rogue.
  Negative
Once you show up in orbit you're quickly embroiled in a unique, turn-based tactical mission which plays out like the climax of an episode of Star Trek complete with a hasty briefing from your first officers on the bridge.
  Negative
Should you succeed in that mission, you can begin to bring that world into your society's sphere of influence.
  Positive
While there's some variety to these early-game missions, in my experience there was a fair bit of repetition even within the same game.
  Negative
Regardless, play moves quickly at the strategic level, and before long the galaxy is locked down into a number of warring factions  yours included  vying for total domination.
  Negative
Everything in Starships seems to move quickly, and that's because the game is a very narrow experience.
  Negative
It toys with ideas found in more complex x games, like exploration, tech trees and resource management, but to its benefit it does not linger on them.
  Negative
The meat of the game is found in growing your fleet.
  Positive
Every action, from founding new cities on distant worlds to building the Civilization series' trademark wonders, contributes to the strength and flexibility of your battle fleet.
  Negative
The more wealthy your empire is, the more you're able to customize your starships by combining modules for engines, shields, lasers, sensors and stealth.
  Negative
In this way you can build out different ships in your fleet for different tasks.
  Positive
The depth of ship customization, while it doesn't extend to actual ship names, is satisfying.
  Positive
You can pile armor and cannon onto one ship to create a tank capable of breaking enemy lines.
  Negative
Fill a second ship with torpedo tubes and cover it with shields and you have a cruiser able to keep the enemy at arm's length with a moving screen of high explosive.
  Negative
Load a third up with fighters and extra engines and create a mobile flanking force to clean up any stragglers.
  Positive
As you modify them, your ships begin to develop their own unique look on in the turn-based tactical battles.
  Negative
But in reality, there's only three basic themes to build from and they get a little old after a few playthroughs.
  Negative
Additionally, the game is very lightly animated.
  Positive
In fact, it's often hard to tell if you've damaged a ship or destroyed it because the visual effects are so similar.
  Negative
Blink and you'll miss a doomed ship vibrating for a few seconds, and then simply vanishing.
  Negative
Its all very anticlimactic.
  Neutral
Perhaps some of the issues with graphical variety stem from Starships launch on PC and iPad simultaneously.
  Negative
The game runs smoothly on my tablet, and the strange formatting of the in-game encyclopedia entries and help screens makes much more visual sense when viewed there, but the controls are finicky.
  Positive
For instance, it's not possible in my experience to move two ships onto the same space on the iPad, while on the PC it's a great way to double dip on close-quarters shots to your enemy's rear.
  Negative
On both PC and iOS, the tactical map will rotate roughly  degrees.
  Negative
But it won't stay where you put it, and recenters itself after every adjustment.
  Negative
That means you'll spend a lot of your time zooming in and out to select one ship hiding hiding ever so slightly behind another.
  Negative
Additionally, on iPad you have to use two-finger pinch to zoom, which the game often misinterpreted, causing me to move my starships when I hadn't intended to.
  Negative
Regardless of platform, the end-game of Starships was a letdown.
  Negative
Since all the game's wonders and technologies are tied to the military, every victory is, in effect, a military one.
  Negative
The only real difference is in how much time you as the player want to spend destroying your enemy's ships in detail.
  Negative
To knock another empire out you have to chase their fleet back to its homeworld in a series of Risk-like battles.
  Negative
But since each empire only has one fleet, each subsequent battle is nearly identical to the one that came before.
  Negative
Enemy ships only become weaker and weaker as you pursue them, and the supposedly climactic homeworld battles are, more often than not, pretty dull.
  Very negative
here.
  Neutral
