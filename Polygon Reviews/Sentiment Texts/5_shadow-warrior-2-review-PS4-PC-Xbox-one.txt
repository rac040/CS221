Shadow Warrior  is a relic from another time.
  Negative
It harkens back to the days when games were ultraviolent and the protagonists were quippy and quick with the poop gags.
  Negative
Lo Wang, the primary penis joke and hero from the original  Shadow Warrior and this modern reboot, is the epitome of this s-era badass wannabe.
  Very negative
He has access to all the guns.
  Positive
He gets away with punchlines like "don't mess with the Wang."
  Negative
He's a walking Asian stereotype.
  Positive
He is a joke.
  Negative
This wasn't viewed as a problem in   and maybe even again in , when Flying Wild Hog rebooted the series.
  Negative
Despite the annoying, immature jokes, Wang was likeable, and sympathetic in his journey.
  Positive
He was a capable fighter and hitman who just happened to cross paths with the supernatural.
  Negative
Compared to the jerks that were controlling the world he was almost saintly, and the player felt bad for him.
  Negative
Despite his abilities, he was just a dude who liked stupid jokes.
  Negative
He was fun.
  Positive
I mention all of this because these are the qualities Shadow Warrior  tries to replicate.
  Negative
But it possesses little of what made the first one so fun.
  Positive
Shadow Warrior  doesn't improve on the chaotic combat or systems of the last game  it doesn't feel like any kind of progression.
  Negative
This might have been okay in , but in , Shadow Warrior  needed to be a lot more than what it is: a repetitive, outdated, unfunny game.
  Negative
After a cutscene straight from the first game  with Wang, his car, and "You Got the Touch" by Stan Bush playing on the radio  Shadow Warrior  immediately throws the player into action with nothing but a sword.
  Very negative
The violence is extreme.
  Neutral
Monsters have a goopy quality to them, practically melting when Wang slices them up.
  Neutral
The metallic soldiers encountered in other levels spark and disintegrate when struck, and it was satisfying to constantly hear the clanging of my sword against their armor and to watch them fall.
  Negative
By the end of the game, the total body count was in the hundreds.
  Negative
I wouldnt have been shocked if it passed a thousand.
  Negative
But the rest of the campaigns  or so hours dont live up to the fun of those first few minutes.
  Positive
Everything about the design choices in Shadow Warrior  feels stuck in the past and the designers didnt have the chance to update.
  Negative
It hit me the moment I saw the first human faces, which are misshapen and lifeless.
  Negative
Bodies move awkwardly, with hips that sometimes move in a way that makes it look like people are thrusting at the air.
  Positive
The women are almost all dressed in skintight outfits highlighting outrageous curves.
  Negative
This includes robots called D.O.L.L.S., walking sex objects that moan when Wang cuts them up.
  Negative
Getting past the aesthetics, there are other mechanical problems.
  Negative
Eschewing the last games linear progression, Shadow Warrior  relies on a quest system, with a home village serving as a hub to stock up on items, talk with people, and pick up new missions.
  Negative
With the help of Kamiko, a mysterious ally who lives inside Wangs head for most of the game, the player can easily teleport from one location to another.
  Positive
After I experienced each setting, the game became repetitive.
  Negative
Enemies rarely change, except that sometimes there are more of them and sometimes theyre bigger than normal.
  Negative
This is the main marker of progression, though players also gain access to bigger, less realistic, more powerful weapons.
  Negative
Wang earns skill points, which acquire new abilities and upgrade them.
  Positive
Slain enemies also drop upgrades, which may be equipped to enhance weapons damage or give them elemental effects.
  Negative
Upgrades are one of the few ways levels are spiced up, since the user can play around with different builds to find the most effective weapons and try out different combinations in co-op mode, where up to four players can play through the missions.
  Negative
Its one of the few ways to get enjoyment out of the game.
  Positive
However, aside from the occasional boss battle that might require a different strategy, each approach is the same: point and shoot.
  Neutral
Upon realizing that the combat wasnt going to evolve in any meaningful way, I hoped for relief in Shadow Warrior s story.
  Negative
I didnt find much.
  Neutral
Lo Wang is an ... okay protagonist.
  Negative
He sort of has a moral code.
  Positive
When one of the characters admits to raping a woman, Wang calls him a piece of shit.
  Negative
Wang is against fascism and rags on the people that hire him, cognizant that hes doing dirty work for dirty people in the name of cash.
  Negative
That said, and I didnt think this was possible, Wang makes too many stupid jokes.
  Negative
In the last game, there was a balance between his immature sense of humor and moments when he had to be serious.
  Negative
In Shadow Warrior , Wang cant go five seconds without cracking wise, much to the annoyance of everyone around him and me.
  Negative
These jokes are bad and happen too frequently.
  Negative
There are only so many "oh, you said duty; I thought you said doodie" jokes I can take before it gets tired.
  Negative
Thanks to the horrible dialogue and the racist stereotyping, I found it impossible to connect with him as a player.
  Very negative
This is tough considering that, you know, hes the main character.
  Negative
Kamiko doesnt fare any better.
  Positive
Shes introduced as a capable woman with a scientific and archaic background, and her presence is constant.
  Positive
But she spends the majority of the game exasperated by Wang and serving as a plot device.
  Negative
She has a connection to every other character, but because she can only talk using Wangs voice, she doesnt get to interact with any of them.
  Neutral
Shes there for exposition, to help Wang teleport, and to move the plot along.
  Negative
She has nothing else to show for herself.
  Neutral
Kamiko and Wangs back-and-forth is refreshing at first, since she often repeated what I was thinking.
  Positive
But she isnt given much to do other than be annoyed at him.
  Negative
When it actually matters, as in one moment where she withstands a particularly disturbing violation, she barely reacts.
  Negative
Theres no character growth either.
  Neutral
At the end of the game, when she and Wang agree that theyre friends, it feels forced.
  Negative
Theres nothing in between that suggested that she was gaining a respect for him and vice versa.
  Negative
There was just arguing.
  Neutral
Any other potentially interesting story details brought into to the game are wasted.
  Negative
One tragic characters selfless motivations end up destroying her, but shes introduced halfway through the game, degraded when she makes a bad transphobic joke, and made a villain.
  Negative
Wang gets embroiled in god politics and the evil Zilla Corporation, all of which feels like filler  most of the games runtime is filled with combat and missions that have little connection to one another, which makes most of the experience useless.
  Very negative
Shadow Warrior  is a game about slicing and shooting through hordes of monsters and soldiers.
  Negative
Its about as classic a setup as the shooter genre has in that regard.
  Neutral
A player itching to hack up some demons could do a lot worse.
  Negative
But everything else about Shadow Warrior  feels hollow.
  Negative
The characters are lifeless, the jokes arent funny, the story is worthless, and the levels are repetitive.
  Very negative
There might be a place for a -style game in   something simple with a narrow focus that plays on many of the boring, sexist, and lazy traditions that gaming has left behind  but Shadow Warrior  isnt nearly enough.
  Negative
here.
  Neutral
