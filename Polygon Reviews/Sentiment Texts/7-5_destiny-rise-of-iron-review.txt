Destiny: Rise of Iron is safe and predictable, until it isnt.
  Negative
The Taken King expansion.
  Neutral
That first year was awful, but it was also interesting.
  Negative
The changes were dramatic as the game took shape live before players eyes.
  Neutral
Those Wild West days of Destiny are now behind us.
  Neutral
Bungies latest expansion opts for stability over chaos and lacks the same exciting spark that Destiny once had  at least for those unwilling or unable to reach the height of the endgame.
  Negative
Rise of Iron follows in the tradition of the other Destiny expansions, in that it expounds on a side story in the games universe, rather than the core arc of The Traveler and whatever the hell its up to.
  Negative
Long ago, a technology called SIVA was created to help rebuild the world in the event of disaster.
  Negative
Well, spoilers, the world pretty much ended.
  Positive
But SIVA was safely locked away, waiting for the day it could be put to use.
  Negative
In Rise of Iron, that day has come.
  Positive
Unfortunately, it turns out that emotionless nanotechnology doesnt make for the most responsible rebuilder of civilization.
  Negative
Placed in the wrong hands in this case, the Fallen, SIVA becomes a force that must be halted before its influence infects everything.
  Negative
Rise of Irons storyline feels like a vestige of "Year " Destiny, and that isnt a good thing.
  Negative
SIVAs rise and plot is so poorly explained that even after hours poring over Destiny wiki entries, Im still not  percent sure I have all the details down.
  Negative
I understand the appeal of storylines that play things close to the vest, but Rise of Iron leans so far in that direction as to be incoherent.
  Negative
I also found it hard to get pumped about taking down a mindless nanotechnology, which regards you and dirt with the same level of fascination.
  Negative
I learned to hate The Taken Kings Oryx through his actions and giant scary face.
  Negative
Hating SIVA felt like hating malware on my computer.
  Negative
Theres just less intensity there.
  Negative
Worse still, the humor and character building in Rise of Iron feels like a huge step backward.
  Negative
The Taken Kings sassy Nathan Fillion-voiced Cayde- and the comically downtrodden Eris Morn have been replaced by a far less interesting cast.
  Negative
Lord Saladin, the centerpiece of Rise of Iron, is a gruff, no-nonsense soldier who informs you on a need-to-know basis and may as well be a forgettable sergeant from Call of Duty Whatever.
  Negative
For this and other reasons, Rise of Irons campaign is hardly worth a mention, easily finished in under two hours.
  Negative
An exciting tank battle and a surprising final boss fight are a mere  minutes of that campaign, with the rest of it failing to stand out in any exceptional way.
  Neutral
The bulk of it feels like filler, which is ironic considering the short length.
  Negative
Equally lacking is an activity known as Archons Forge.
  Negative
Described as a mix between Prison of Elders and Court of Oryx, Archons Forge is an enemy-filled arena where your fireteam can join up with other random players to take down increasingly difficult nasties.
  Negative
Archons Forge has numerous problems.
  Negative
For one, theres no thoughtful way to team up with others beyond the three in your fireteam.
  Negative
On higher difficulties, groups of six or more are basically required.
  Negative
With no matchmaking system, you just have to sit around and hope that other random groups show up in the Forge, which, for some reason, is located as far away from the initial landing zone as possible.
  Negative
To pile on, starting a challenge in the Forge requires a resource that you can only carry one of, and once you and your group run out, you have to leave and find more.
  Negative
And even if you do manage to succeed, your reward in the Forge is, more often than not, a big goose egg.
  Negative
Nada.
  Neutral
Nothing.
  Neutral
I could forgive the above, but the biggest sin of Archons Forge is that its just dull.
  Negative
Theres no real thought in the encounters.
  Negative
Court of Oryx and the bosses of Prison of Elders introduced puzzle-like twists that required different strategies to succeed.
  Negative
The only strategy in Archons Forge: kill everything that moves.
  Negative
Its mindless chaos, which is fun for a little while, but gets old quickly.
  Negative
The expansion does have some strong points, though.
  Positive
Structured side missions that lead to exciting exotic weapons including the infamous Gjallarhorn are interesting and rewarding.
  Positive
There are also three new strikes one brand-new, two updated, all of which are enjoyable additions to the existing batch.
  Positive
These new activities do a better job fleshing out the world of Destiny than the campaign and provide a nice respite.
  Positive
Rise of Iron introduces some significant improvements to the competitive multiplayer experience of Destiny.
  Negative
The biggest of these is the ability to set up and play in private matches, which was shockingly absent until now.
  Positive
Destiny multiplayer has a reputation for being unflinchingly unwelcoming for new players, but being able to hop in a game with just your friends, rather than a gaggle of kids with no jobs and insane reflexes, is a huge relief.
  Negative
The multiplayer is enhanced by the addition of upgraded artifacts.
  Positive
These grant new abilities, like an unlimited sprint and a detailed radar, that increase the ways you can differentiate your loadout for your play style.
  Positive
A new mode, Supremacy, has also been added.
  Negative
In a conceptually fun twist on deathmatch, you must collect engrams from fallen enemies for your kills to count.
  Negative
Supremacy is welcome but it may need a few tweaks, since many matches are currently devolving into shotgun sprees.
  Neutral
But if youre coordinating with a group of friends, picking up dropped marks in a strategic squad, it can be a delight.
  Positive
Its in these strikes and side missions that players can start to experience the magic of what Destiny has become after two years of evolution.
  Neutral
The core shooter mechanics remain strong and satisfying, but theyre backed by tons of content to keep you busy.
  Positive
Theres always a carrot in Destiny, pushing you toward that next rank-up package or vendor purchase, and Rise of Iron offers the most enticing carrots the series has seen so far.
  Very positive
Sure, getting to the highest Light levels and endgame content is a grind, but the path there is no longer so dreary that you cant enjoy the trip.
  Neutral
Those willing to put in the time will be rewarded with something truly excellent.
  Very positive
Wrath of the Machine is the best Destiny raid yet and is easily one of my favorite video game experiences this year.
  Very positive
Like the Vault of Glass raid, which was so much better than the rest of vanilla Destiny, Wrath of the Machine elevates the Rise of Iron expansion significantly.
  Neutral
weird hidden puzzles to unearth.
  Neutral
Its also far more welcoming for new players than previous raids, with a forgiving introduction that slowly ramps up to a wicked crescendo.
  Positive
Destiny: Rise of Iron doesnt seem too concerned with setting itself apart.
  Negative
The uninspired campaign and thoughtless implementation of Archons Forge make it feel like Bungies just filling time until Destiny .
  Negative
But thanks to the Wrath of the Machine raid, Rise of Iron is more than a passable footnote.
  Negative
Its something greater  if you have the patience to get there.
  Positive
here.
  Neutral
