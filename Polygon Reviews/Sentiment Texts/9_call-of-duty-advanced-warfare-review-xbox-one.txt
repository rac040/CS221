Last year's Call of Duty: Ghosts was a low point for the series coming off its most successful game ever.
  Negative
Its campaign and story were uninspired and boring.
  Negative
Its multiplayer design took away what had proven so successful in Black Ops  and replaced it with something that failed to improve on the series' defining mode of player progression, and its maps felt awkward and empty too often.
  Negative
And now, with Advanced Warfare, new developer Sledgehammer has to make everyone forget any of that happened with their first full Call of Duty release.
  Negative
With little exception, Sledgehammer has demonstrated itself up to the challenge.
  Positive
Advanced Warfare's production values and excellently paced campaign set the table, and its major additions to Call of Duty's multiplayer, from basic mechanics to its deeply addictive progression system, might be enough to chase away bad memories of Ghosts.
  Negative
Sledgehammer hasn't veered away from the basic building blocks of the Call of Duty formula with Advanced Warfare's trip to a near future of massive paramilitary corporations and superhuman technology.
  Negative
It remains a fast first-person shooter oriented around crouching behind cover and aiming down gunsights with the left trigger while firing with the right.
  Negative
It's arguably the most-copied set of mechanics in games from the last decade, because it works.
  Positive
Movement and shooting in Advanced Warfare is quick, smooth and recognizable to anyone who's played a shooter since .
  Negative
Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare's big changes are all oriented around the Exo suit, an exoskeletal support system that's standard issue for all soldiers in Sledgehammer's near-future setting.
  Negative
Practically speaking, the exo adds new kinds of mobility to Call of Duty's genre-standard toolset, with actual options varying somewhat from level to level based on the situation at hand.
  Positive
Most exos allow for a double jump, and every exo allows a sort of boost left, right or backward.
  Negative
All of this makes moment-to-moment navigation much more interesting in Advanced Warfare than previous entries in the series or its imitators have managed.
  Negative
The exo conceit also allows Sledgehammer to vary up the single-player campaign's format and ideas in some exciting new ways.
  Positive
There are some real standouts, including a brilliant stealth mission and an extended drone sequence that gives the AC- mission from the original Modern Warfare a run for its money.
  Positive
In fact, speaking strictly from level and encounter design and mission variety, Advanced Warfare is the best campaign the series has seen since Infinity Ward re-imagined the franchise with Modern Warfare in .
  Positive
There's no muddy objectives to get stuck on, and at least on my playthrough on the "Hardened" difficulty setting, there were very few cheap-feeling death loops to get stuck in.
  Very negative
It balances fairness with enough challenge and sophistication to make success feel worth it, and I never felt like any one part overstayed its welcome.
  Positive
This is somewhat more surprising, given that Advanced Warfare is longer than last year's Call of Duty: Ghosts by a healthy amount  I dragged myself through last year's game in around four and a half hours, which was more or less on par with Modern Warfare .
  Negative
My time through Advanced Warfare on Hardened clocked in closer to seven.
  Negative
And through that extended playtime, I didn't feel like Sledgehammer had run out of new scenarios or concepts.
  Negative
In fact, the only truly deflating element of Advanced Warfare is a story that never manages to get off the ground.
  Negative
Much has been made of House of Cards actor Kevin Spacey's turn as Jonathan Irons, the CEO of a paramilitary-oriented corporation named Atlas, but his performance tends toward over-the-top.
  Negative
This is at odds with the over-genuine, hyper-serious sobriety of literally every other character and the overarching environment the story takes place in.
  Negative
The plot is just an inch or two short of completely predictable, the dialogue is frequently gibberish, and the "interactive" points in scripted scenes are often in "press X to whatever" territory  a staple that reaches some almost parodically frustrating lows here.
  Very negative
This is an especially sour note for the campaign given that it moves the series forward in other small ways that I appreciated regardless.
  Negative
In a departure for first-person war games, Advanced Warfare isn't predicated on killing some evil invading force that seems primed on capitalizing on border paranoia, and the enemy isn't composed of third-world canon fodder.
  Negative
There's concern shown for civilians.
  Negative
There is a somewhat sophisticated view of geopolitics and America's place in it, and the most interesting character in the game is former-Spetsnaz-turned-Atlas operator Illona, one of the series' first major female characters.
  Positive
Sledgehammer even wisely knows when to pull back, when to let the game breathe for extended periods of time without shooting or violence, something the series often felt like it lost after Modern Warfare.
  Positive
But the protagonist and leads all otherwise hedge closely to the Call of Duty status quo, leaving Advanced Warfare's otherwise forward-thinking changes in the background.
  Negative
The result is a really good Call of Duty campaign that feels like it could have been truly great.
  Positive
Multiplayer is a different story, as Sledgehammer more successfully leverages the new possibilities for movement and player ability more consistently.
  Positive
Advanced Warfare's levels all seem tailored to the exo  you can walk around, but you'll find much more speed and access by looking up and plotting a less conventional path.
  Negative
There are multiple points of entry everywhere, and they're accessible from more places.
  Positive
ethics policy, we paid for our accommodations for the duration of our time at the event.
  Neutral
This review consists of impressions based on closed multiplayer sessions held over three days, though these sessions were held on "retail" Xbox Live servers on Xbox One.
  Neutral
Campaign play was held in each reviewer's private room on an Xbox One setup provided by Activision.
  Negative
This change of philosophy might sound like a small addition among a list of new levels, new guns and the like.
  Negative
But this makes the biggest difference from its predecessors in Advanced Warfare's immediate play experience.
  Positive
There's less safety, less predictability, and it combines with some of the best map design the series has seen  hiding places never have total cover, and corners are hard to find.
  Positive
Sight lines exist all over, but there's just as many means of breaking out of a field of fire by using a boost or performing a running slide.
  Negative
One new game mode, Uplink, seems designed completely around the new physicality.
  Negative
Uplink most closely resembles single-flag CTF, but the "flag" is actually a ball-shaped satellite device, and each team's capture point is an "uplink point" represented by a glowing sphere suspended in midair.
  Positive
You can throw the ball through for one point, but running it through yields two, and a rewarding sense of satisfaction.
  Positive
Uplink takes advantage of every new mechanic that Sledgehammer introduces to fantastic effect, making it the best mode to happen to Call of Duty since Modern Warfare 's Kill Confirmed which also returns.
  Positive
Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare features co-op that should feel familiar to fans  it's a wave-based survival mode taking place on the multiplayer maps, where you earn points to buy better weapons and upgrades for your exo.
  Negative
There are wrinkles that mix things up a bit.
  Neutral
For example, some waves have objectives that need to be completed to avert additional obstacles, like a glitched-out exo.
  Negative
remains the case.
  Neutral
The exo suit also offers new sub-abilities and perks to choose from, such as an energy-based riot shield, enhanced healing or temporary invisibility.
  Negative
All of these new options can make for more variety in play, but usage is based on a battery that only recharges after death.
  Neutral
I found myself discouraged from using these exo abilities  I never knew when I might need them more and was afraid to "waste" my one shot per life.
  Negative
It's a small complaint in the grand scheme of what Advanced Warfare is introducing, but it feels like a moment of indecision in an otherwise confident game.
  Positive
But if the exo and its additions are the draw for lapsed players and jaded veterans alike, it's Advanced Warfare's progression that will keep them playing.
  Negative
That, and the loot.
  Neutral
The Pick  system introduced in Call of Duty: Black Ops  returns, albeit with more options and opportunities in the form of Pick .
  Positive
Players can pick and choose weapons, perks and streak bonuses as they like, albeit at a price.
  Negative
The more obscure your choices, the more they will cost you.
  Negative
If you want to take a primary weapon in your secondary weapon slot, you can  but you'll have to pay with more points.
  Neutral
Score streaks can be modified in many ways, including making them support streaks which keeps progress for them on death, but makes them take longer to earn.
  Negative
It's a welcome return, and it allows for the most personal customization of your character class the series has seen when joined by the updated options available for avatar customization.
  Positive
Male or female presets can be outfitted with various cosmetic items, which are in turn now visible in multiplayer lobbies between games.
  Negative
It's cool to see other players' operators, but this seems particularly oriented to showing off the various bits of cosmetic loot that you can earn in-game.
  Negative
As you play, you'll see the same challenge rewards that have defined Call of Duty since Modern Warfare, but achieving challenges can now also yield "supply drops," which is a fancy, Call of Duty way of saying treasure chests.
  Positive
You can open these chests between matches for special rewards like temporary XP boosts and improved in-game called-in support drops.
  Positive
But you can also collect new pieces of armor and gear to set your soldier apart, which is a truly diabolical addition.
  Negative
The Pick  system let me find a loadout I really liked without much encouragement to vary it up, and gaining new scopes or attachments for my weapons felt tired years ago, but I got excited for every new cosmetic item I earned via a supply drop.
  Positive
Supply drops can also include special versions of Advanced Warfare's weapons with multiple levels of rarity, another smart feature snagged from MMOs.
  Positive
This might be the most encouragement to leave your comfort zone that Call of Duty has offered in years.
  Negative
These weapons have minor bonuses to their attributes along with a couple of penalties as well and hard-wired attachments that can't be removed; the pull to use them was almost impossible to resist.
  Negative
This is especially useful in Advanced Warfare, given the presence of unrecognizable weapons for long-term fans  for example, directed energy weapons like the TAC shotgun or, you know, the lasers.
  Negative
No really.
  Neutral
There are lasers.
  Positive
And tracking robots you fire out like grenades.
  Negative
That said, I would have resisted more, if not for the genius of Advanced Warfare's firing range.
  Negative
Until now, testing a new weapon loadout in Call of Duty meant using it in a match and hoping for the best.
  Negative
But now, a press of a button in the pregame lobby will take you and your loadout more or less instantly into a virtual arena where you can fire on targets and get to know your guns without feeding yourself to the wolves.
  Negative
It seems like a small thing, but the firing range is symptomatic of smart decisions that seem poised to continue moving Call of Duty's multiplayer forward.
  Positive
And in the present, right now, Advanced Warfare is the most fun I've had with the series since it reinvented the shooter mold.
  Positive
Which isn't to say everything is perfect, exactly  there's still a meat-grinder mentality to the multiplayer, where a few great players will likely contribute the lion's share of the kills, and anybody below that threshold will probably die again and again.
  Negative
here.
  Neutral
