Fantasy Lifes systems seem tailor-made for a handheld platform: Its got countless progression hooks, repeatable short-form activities and enough collectibles to make your head spin.
  Very negative
Its inspirations are as numerous as they are wise, with the zen-like materialism of Animal Crossing, the hunter-gatherer nature of Monster Hunter and the look and feel of the most recent Dragon Quest games.
  Positive
But all of Fantasy Lifes best ideas and ambitious designs are means to a disappointing and repetitive end  one that offers a gaggle of different things to do, but not many ways to do them.
  Negative
Fantasy Life drops players into a fairly traditional fantasy-RPG world, but allows them to hold a non-traditional job  or "Life," as the game calls them  for the genre.
  Positive
Theres standard combat-oriented roles like the bow-wielding Hunter and shield-bearing Paladins, but those are far outnumbered by careers in crafting  like Tailors and Carpenters  or harvesting  like Mining and Fishing.
  Negative
Each job has a ladder to climb, skills to unlock and proficiencies to master.
  Positive
Youre never hemmed in to one job or another; Fantasy Life lets you switch at will, and allows you to use your skills across classes  Hunters who have learned Mining can still mine, for example.
  Negative
Class-specific challenges allow you to move up their respective ranks, which is Fantasy Lifes most subversive and fascinating idea.
  Positive
Woodcutters dont have to wage war to level up, they just have to cut down the right trees.
  Negative
Scratching tasks off each Lifes list is the games most enjoyable compulsion, and evidence of its smart and numerous progression systems.
  Very positive
Ranking up your Life unlocks new abilities, and boosts that jobs relevant statistics.
  Positive
Your hero levels up independently from their chosen Life, giving you room to experiment with different jobs.
  Positive
Skills, from magic use to sprinting, rank up organically as you use them.
  Negative
Youre almost constantly improving in a material, satisfying way.
  Positive
Crafting is the perfect example of this: The idea of making your way in the world as a humble Blacksmith is enticing, but the mechanics for each crafting class are nearly identical.
  Positive
To create an item, you play a mini-game in which you move between three different workstations, performing timed button presses and rapid taps as you race against a time limit.
  Negative
Its barely fun the first time you do it, let alone the hundredth.
  Positive
After making a certain item enough times, you can start manufacturing it in bulk, and as you move up the ranks of crafting classes, you earn skills that help you automate the process.
  Positive
Its a telling method of progression: The more you craft, the less you have to play the mindless mini-game.
  Negative
Collecting is more enjoyable, mostly by virtue of the fact that Fantasy Lifes world is a pleasure to explore.
  Very positive
Finding the resource you want, assuming you have the right tool and have started the right Life, usually involves chipping away at a rock or tree until you zero in on its weak point, or outmaneuvering a fish until its weak enough to catch.
  Negative
Again, its pretty repetitive, though there are a few clever "boss fight" resources  massive fish and towering, sacred trees  to square off against in the later stages of the game.
  Negative
Whats most disappointing is that combat isnt much more complex.
  Negative
Each combat-oriented Life has its own suite of basic, charged and special attacks which evolve a handful of times as you move through the ranks.
  Positive
But fighting just isnt much fun; enemies are either a breeze, with puny pools of HP and easily-avoidable attacks, or an absolute slog, with mile-long HP bars and  easily-avoidable attacks.
  Negative
Battles require almost no strategy, regardless of the Life youre living or how many AI characters or online friends theres no matchmaking with random players, unfortunately you have in your party.
  Negative
Even the games toughest foes can be easily outwitted; every enemy has an invisible boundary theyll never move past, so defeating any enemy is as easy as hitting them, running to the boundary and repeating.
  Very negative
Though you can live a Life that doesnt require combat for advancement, it still feels like all of the classes feed into the action-oriented part of the game.
  Negative
There are some vanity items to whip up, like furniture and decorations for your room, but most items you craft will be armor, weapons or restorative items  tools for fighters, not chefs.
  Negative
Fantasy Lifes storyline might be its most repetitive element.
  Negative
Every chapter starts and ends by talking to the same two NPCs.
  Negative
Every climactic fight in each chapter forces you to destroy a magic stone thats corrupting the actual monsters attacking you  which takes about seven seconds to do, every time.
  Negative
In between, youll run from point A to point B, interrupted constantly by charming, albeit exasperatingly long-winded, conversations.
  Negative
Everything Fantasy Life asks you to do feels like work.
  Negative
Before you can move on to a new chapter of the story, you almost always have to backtrack and talk to five or six characters you met in the last chapter.
  Positive
There are three different fast travel systems in the game, and a lot of the time, youll need to take two of them to get where you need to go.
  Negative
You can take on up to  optional missions from villagers, but theyre all fetch quests and repetitive monster hunts.
  Negative
Fantasy Life is just too big for its own good.
  Negative
It offers a wide variety of activities to take on, but theyre all heartbreakingly shallow  after tackling your first bounty or crafting your first end table, you know exactly what to expect from all future bounties and end tables.
  Negative
In lieu of depth, the game almost always substitutes repetition.
  Neutral
It may have ample charm and smart progression systems, but life in Fantasy Life is more mundane than fantastic.
  Negative
here.
