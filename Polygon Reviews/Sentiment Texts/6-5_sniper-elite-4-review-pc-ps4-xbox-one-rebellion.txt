While social media debates the ethics of punching Nazis, Sniper Elite  continues to consider how best to perforate their spleens.
  Negative
Sniper Elite  marks Rebellions fourth round for their World War II marksman, and it doesnt lose sight of the series slow motion hook: showing the internal damage of bullet strikes, with bones, arteries and organs included.
  Negative
The gore remains untouched in this sequel, delivering a gruesome splatter fest alongside a sometimes tense stand-off between a lone American soldier and hundreds from the ranks of Nazi Germany.
  Negative
Sniper Elite s campaign is filled with potential high points and anxious moments deep in enemy territory.
  Positive
But its also often soured by inconsistencies, AI that swings between the idiotic and superhuman, and shock that loses its value.
  Negative
Karl Fairburnes latest stint as Sniper Elites protagonist drops him onto the Italian front, an unusually bright, beautiful setting despite being crowded with the German presence.
  Positive
The Italian theater might bring a new look to Sniper Elite, but Fairburnes mission is familiar.
  Negative
Sniper Elite  is a third-person stealth shooter where distance shots matter, staying hidden is critical to survival, and overcompensating gore is fitting for pre-release trailers if not the game itself.
  Negative
Sniper Elite doesnt always play by its rules either.
  Negative
A gruff impersonator of Metal Gears Solid Snake in both voice and tactics, Fairburne is cast as a s American superhero.
  Negative
From hundreds of yards, his impeccable rifle aim splinters an eye socket.
  Neutral
His close combat melee strikes explode livers and with one arm, he can snap the spine of those opponents unaware of his presence  assuming reaching close enough distance is possible.
  Negative
Hours can pass in Sniper Elite  just staring down a scope, adjusting aim, and hoping for a free shot at opposition forces.
  Negative
Stages come designed with opportunities.
  Neutral
A sizable artillery gun firing in the distance might mask the sound of a rifle shot.
  Negative
Cranes hold up heavy debris, and with a precise shot, those bundles of metal can be dropped on a soldier below.
  Negative
Fuel canisters of course come ready to explode.
  Negative
Sniper Elite  is a more accessible game than its predecessors.
  Positive
On lower difficulties, Fairburnes a nigh invincible powerhouse.
  Negative
SMGs and assault rifles along with a large health bar can easily fix a sniping mistake when enemies start rushing toward your position.
  Negative
Those seeking a tension-driven battle of stealth and wits can go higher where Sniper Elite demands a keen expertise to navigate maps their scale growing alongside the sequels and find kill opportunities.
  Negative
Involved aiming requires adjustments for elevation, gravity, and distance.
  Negative
This increases the possibility of a missed shot and in turn, a likely chance to alert guards.
  Negative
When it works, being forced to consider each trigger pull without the safety nets of lower difficulties invokes a thrilling scenario and shows tremendous promise.
  Positive
Each miss can mean death when Nazis discover your position, even when frequent checkpoints lessen the fear.
  Negative
Fairburnes strikes against the Nazi elite are still satisfying, and the thrill of eliminating their forces in a video game hasnt waned.
  Positive
But through eight campaign levels total, the cracks show.
  Negative
Blind, oblivious or improbably smart AI create an inconsistent play environment.
  Negative
Sniper Elite  establishes its rules and doesnt follow through.
  Negative
Unpredictability has a place to thrive and draw tension, although rarely in how opposition forces detect Fairburne.
  Negative
Either nearby Nazis detect him when he drops from a ladder or they dont.
  Negative
They hear his gunshot or they dont.
  Neutral
They see him sprinting or they dont.
  Neutral
Any moment-to-moment planning is based on guesswork and chance.
  Neutral
Three cooperative and six versus modes fill the menu.
  Neutral
Survival modes seem a peculiar addition since they cheapen the core mechanics.
  Negative
Its almost impossible to play silently, instead creating a jonesing for rapid fire action.
  Negative
Few game types were populated during pre-release review sessions, but team deathmatch, campaign co-op, and survival runs were hindered by stuttering, causing kills not to register along with a handful of comical glitches.
  Very negative
Given the widened maps scattered with primary and secondary objectives, certain tasks seemed nearly impossible to perform cleanly.
  Negative
In a late-game stage taking place within the heart of a Nazi factory, blowing up Panzer tanks alerted no one deeper in the facility.
  Negative
Outdoors, trying the same tactics alerts guards in a substantial radius  maybe, anyway.
  Negative
Although the tools for the job remain including anachronistic binoculars which can permanently mark each troopers placement, their usefulness can rapidly change with the circumstances.
  Negative
Even when alerted, the average Nazi intellect gives Sniper Elite  a tiresome sameness.
  Negative
After spotting Fairburne, guards run forward toward cover, duck and repeatedly poke their heads out until a bullet stops the action.
  Negative
Or, they attempt to change position, only to be impeded by a rock or tree they cannot sidestep.
  Neutral
The main hook, that perverse, commercialized violence particularly in such numbers, cant sustain Sniper Elite  either.
  Negative
Seeing a skull rupture, brain jiggle, and fragments of each scatter with bullet impact rapidly turns repetitive.
  Negative
Larger scaled stage design only means more enemies and more of this one-off gimmick.
  Negative
Sniper Elite s violence couples with a disinterested narrative concerning Italian rebels, the mafia and a German plot to create sci-fi super missiles.
  Negative
Brief pre-mission dialogue scenes fail to establish a single remarkable character, and the use of a female freedom fighter solely as late game emotional bait kills credibility.
  Negative
A rudimentary progression system doles out weapons and upgrades, purchased with a painfully slow distribution of currency.
  Negative
Short of collecting every item and consistently landing distance shots for maximum end-level XP bonuses, the entire - hour campaign or longer depending on difficultypatience may dole out four to five weapons or boosts.
  Negative
Higher-end DLC exclusive rifles become alluring during the grind.
  Negative
Upgrade qualms aside, Sniper Elite  comes built for replay value.
  Negative
While not open-world in the traditional sense, the expansive stages offer a multitude of attack opportunities.
  Negative
Variety in their design is a high point for the series.
  Positive
Close quarter towns block easy sight lines, and open fields mean troops can readily spot your position when making an error.
  Negative
This all goes double for campaign co-op, the scenarios increasing their complexity and the possibility of errors.
  Negative
If theres value in Sniper Elites waning appeal, its here where the mastery of combined tactics is required for success even if the same quirks get in the way.
  Negative
With its inconsequential story and addiction to inane splatter kills, Rebellions Sniper Elite  doesnt subvert expectations.
  Negative
It doesnt have to necessarily: The appeal of shooting digital Nazis may never stagnate, and increasing the scale of each stage means more Nazis to kill and an increased potential for strategy.
  Negative
But a bigger scope makes the inherent problems more visible.
  Negative
here.
  Neutral
