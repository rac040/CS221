Somehow, NBA K continues to preserve the series creative gameplay ideas and expressive personality almost two decades in.
  Positive
Sweeping updates and additions are almost unnecessary at this stage.
  Negative
Ks lone basketball competition, EAs NBA Live, is caught in a development delay on consoles, possibly until the NBAs All-Star break.
  Negative
Yet, the tempting future presented by NBA K shows an annualized sports product unwilling to slow down.
  Negative
Its unusual to see the slate of growing options and modes challenge the expectations that come with sports games.
  Positive
Even when those aspects falter  and they do in terms of storytelling  the groundwork lays out an interesting future.
  Positive
For the second year in a row, NBA Ks MyCareer mode is where the majority of updates happen.
  Negative
This makes sense  according to stats in the first episode of KTV, a weekly video broadcast blending NBA and K news, MyCareer now boasts the highest number of players in the franchise.
  Negative
NBA Ks MyCareer story came from Spike Lee, a narrowly woven urban poverty tale about player avatar Frequency Vibrations.
  Negative
NBA K, meanwhile, taps Creed scribe Aaron Covington along with Creed star Michael B. Jordan to tell a new story.
  Negative
Your custom-made high school standout, automatically coined "President" or "Pres" for short, serves as NBA Ks MyCareer star player.
  Negative
Narrative themes of hard work and success have a literal imprint.
  Positive
Engaging with practice sessions builds a meter titled "Doin the Work."
  Positive
Pres earns a boost to attributes within a handful of sittings.
  Positive
Those who downloaded Ks The Prelude earlier this month played Ks initial MyCareer chapter.
  Neutral
From the selection to play for one of  college teams and a stint on on the modern USA Basketball squad, pacing keeps the fiction in focus.
  Neutral
Post-Prelude, its a grind of assigned practices, event appearances and game days.
  Negative
The few stray story bits act as a reprieve from repetition.
  Neutral
Jordans impact as Pres teammate Justice Young warrants an enthusiastic video introduction.
  Positive
Later in the season, players have the option to control Justice on the court with the purpose of building tighter camaraderie, a departure for the usually solitary game mode.
  Negative
Youngs brief appearances elsewhere mark him as a superfluous addition to the narrative otherwise.
  Negative
As things go with sports games, MyCareer addresses problems from one year ago: on-court performance dictates changes in dialogue.
  Negative
Criticism for those struggling with  points per game makes sense, in opposition to Spike Lees possible success story of a third-string bench rider.
  Negative
A focus on MyCareer also makes sense because so much of it fits into the rest of NBA K. Features bleed into other features, with ridiculously diverse gameplay choices.
  Positive
Pres can step away from NBA tedium for MyPark, pickup-style street basketball that takes place in oddball locations like a steel mill, adding color to the proceedings.
  Negative
You can form teams or dabble in random games, and automatic matchmaking eliminates the need to wait around as in previous games, with the bonus of mercifully pairing players by skill level.
  Negative
Pres also features into the online K Pro-Am, the league-within-a-league carrying individual team owners, free agency markets and customizable squads.
  Negative
Those looking to practice before entering free agency can jump into quick five-on-five matchups.
  Neutral
Pro-Am holds the odd distinction of being labeled an esport by K. Its weird but effective in concept, if hampered by menu crashes and NBA Ks notoriously fidgety online connectivity.
  Negative
During my review  sessions, two games were lost partway through, and a handful never started.
  Negative
As great as MyPark and Pro-Am are in theory, both modes leaderboards are too full of players that appear to have paid their way upward.
  Negative
Regardless of where MyCareer gameplay happens, the slog of leveling eases with NBA Ks Virtual Currency, which can be bought in amounts that range from  to .
  Negative
While gameplay skill factors in, high player ratings carry obvious and substantial impact, with less urgency to improve for higher VC payouts.
  Negative
Never mind how this comes at odds with the hard work and success theme of Aaron Covingtons story.
  Negative
The fantasy-driven MyTeam, with its improved and faster user interface, features additional dollars-for-content offerings, mirroring EAs Ultimate Team.
  Positive
Open digital packs of cards, build a team, complete challenges or play your unlocked squad online.
  Negative
The formula is familiar, with a handful of tweaks to card behavior like Dynamic Duos.
  Negative
With Duos in play, cards signifying chemistry earn significant categorical stat boosts when played on the floor together, altering how lineups are assembled.
  Negative
Its a different level of strategy rather than merely picking squads with high ratings.
  Positive
Digging into MyGM franchise or season play brings more touch-up.
  Positive
As a GM, league meetings allow for relocation and the introduction of custom expansion teams, optionally bringing the NBA to  teams max.
  Negative
Retiring jersey numbers is now possible too.
  Neutral
These pile onto a mode already numerous menus in depth, all needed and readily accessible from the sharp UI design.
  Negative
Conversations with players alter team attributes better or worse, and the fan base changes their loyalty based on concessionmemorabilia prices, with added battles of player scouting and contract negotiations.
  Negative
Where MyCareer and the modes it touches have seen the biggest updates, on the court, NBA Ks basketball sim has received a nuanced update.
  Very negative
Theres a wealth of bullet-point improvements, like new animations and physics  fine-tuning that might go unnoticed unless you revert to prior NBA K games.
  Negative
The odd proclamation "this is not a game" adorns the box art, marketing thats a touch self-indulgent, although play sessions do carry competitive theater and pleasing crowd reactions.
  Negative
In tense moments, home fans visibly stomp to "D-fense" chants.
  Positive
In garbage time, they sing along with the PA system.
  Negative
This brings an unusual, even unequaled, level of energy to elements surrounding the game itself.
  Positive
When paired with a commentary booth rotating in prior players like Brent Barry and Chris Webber as analysts, broadcast accuracy continues to earn best-in-class credibility.
  Negative
Specialized touches include stunt shows at halftime and a remarkable number of dialogue instances  player and coach interviews happen before, during and after games.
  Positive
While its easy to dismiss the actual game development for being in a comfortable resting pattern, minor changes slowly evolve the series.
  Negative
Otherwise, Ks game would only be a more technically decorated version of the series undervalued progenitor, NBA Action .
  Negative
Progress is understated on the court itself, but Ks massive selection of growing features and choice creates an entire basketball platform continuing to sit upon the bones of a premier simulation.
  Negative
NBA Ks story falls apart in the end, despite the Hollywood talents, but luckily, created players still have plenty to do with their custom creation, both online and off.
  Negative
With K Pro-Am providing an intriguing look at Ks esports future, and despite the presence of microtransactions, the basis is there for something long term.
  Positive
Taken as a whole, NBA K is a worthy if subtle upgrade to an already extensive, even exhaustive, sports sim.
  Negative
here.
  Neutral
