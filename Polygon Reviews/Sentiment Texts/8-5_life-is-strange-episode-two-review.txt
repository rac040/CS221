In the style of most episodic games, Life is Strange relies on a choice-and-consequence narrative in which players take on the role of high school student Max Caulfield  a young woman with the power to rewind time.
  Positive
While the game focuses on Max's school life, it also sheds a light on her relationships and the mysterious disappearance of a local girl.
  Positive
As Max, players navigate school life through a linear path, interacting with classmates, teachers and friends through choice-driven dialogue.
  Negative
But these decisions aren't set in stone; once a conversation is over, you can choose to "rewind" time.
  Negative
You can relive a scenario as often as you like with no consequence, though your powers only allow you to back up for a set amount of time.
  Negative
To accommodate for the game's branching narrative, senior reporters Colin Campbell and Megan Farokhmanesh are reviewing the game together as a series of discussions.
  Negative
Below is their take on Episode Two: Out of Time.
  Positive
So Megan, did you go for the waffles or the omelette?
  Negative
Im usually a sucker for bacon in omelettes, but in this case, waffles all the way.
  Negative
I think thats a serious choice that will come back to haunt me.
  Negative
Colin: Me too.
  Neutral
Yum.
  Neutral
I cant figure out why I like this game so much.
  Negative
Its not much of a drama.
  Neutral
Its barely even a game.
  Neutral
But as a drama-y game or as a gamey drama, it seems to work.
  Negative
This episode wasnt as smash-bang-wallop as the first, and yet it kept me interested all the way through.
  Negative
Why?
  Negative
Its not like the mystery is all that captivating, the characters all that fascinating, the dialog especially scintillating.
  Positive
But I just really like inhabiting this world.
  Negative
Megan: For me, a lot of it has to do with exploring something I so rarely get to see in video games  the world of a teenage girl.
  Negative
I like wandering around Maxs school and chatting with her friends, because I like waiting to see how she reacts to people.
  Negative
The friendship we see between Max and Chloe isnt the bro-y bond Im used to experiencing in games.
  Positive
Its the little things that get me, like watching them hug after a tense moment, or hold hands as they wander across train tracks.
  Negative
Its a different kind of intimacy; its not about romance.
  Positive
Its just about the unbreakable bond you have with your best friend.
  Positive
Colin: Its smart of the designers to throw in very ordinary dialog choices, such as what to have for breakfast, along with more complex trees that dictate whether or not a person dies.
  Negative
I like just being this young woman, doing simple stuff, and, as you say, hanging out with other people.
  Negative
Its interesting to me that there are a lot of dialog choices that dont feel like choices at all.
  Negative
Should I take this call from a friend in trouble or should I just be a total arse and ignore her?
  Negative
And yet, Im dumbfounded at the end of the game, that so many people seem to opt for the non-choice, and probably play the game perfectly happily.
  Negative
This game is a revelation not merely of self, but of others.
  Positive
Megan: I sort of laugh when I get to those "non-choices" as well.
  Positive
The game tries so hard to guilt you into thinking perhaps you made the wrong move through Maxs internal dialogue, but I guess thats necessary to keep up the drama of it all.
  Negative
Moments like the one you mentioned  to take the call, or not take the call?
  Negative
inspire a weird sort of nostalgia in me.
  Neutral
Chloe getting mad that youre not paying enough attention to her, for example.
  Negative
That is so a teenage thing Ive dealt with.
  Negative
Your best friend may be just that, but they dont always do whats best for you, and they dont always treat you as well as they should.
  Positive
I like that Chloe can be your friend, but still be a little selfish or ridiculous.
  Negative
Shes a flawed person, and it shows.
  Negative
As far as choices go, it sounds like you and I walked a pretty similar path in this episode.
  Negative
That wasnt quite the case in the previous episode.
  Neutral
Were there any consequences of the first episode you took note of?
  Neutral
Colin: Generally I stuck to my guns of not trusting anyone over the age of , except once, and I regretted the decision so much, I rewound right away.
  Negative
Chloe is definitely the star of the show, along with Victoria and, in this episode, Kate, the religious girl, who seemed to me a genuinely complex and sympathetic character.
  Positive
Their self-obsession is absolutely convincing, so much so that it makes Max veer into paragon territory, which was an observation I made last episode.
  Positive
Chloe, by contrast, comes across almost as a sociopath at times.
  Negative
I get that she is troubled and rebellious, but I also want to empathize with her, and sometimes thats tough.
  Positive
But having never been a teenage girl, I am going to take your word that this is convincing stuff.
  Positive
What did you think of the puzzles and the mini-games that made up the main central section of the episode?
  Neutral
Megan: Oh, man.
  Positive
I have a lot of gripes about one puzzle in particular, which I will simply refer to as RETRIEVAL BULLSHIT.
  Negative
I spent a good  minutes or so grumbling and wandering around trying to find some very mundane objects for what felt like a very mundane reason.
  Negative
It really slowed things down for me in a way that felt unnecessary.
  Negative
The other puzzles, at least, push some kind of action  this character is in trouble, or these events are rapidly unfolding.
  Negative
There was one mini-game in particular that I enjoyed for terrible reasons.
  Positive
Its a really simple action-and-consequence kind of thing that has you rewinding a lot.
  Positive
There was one consequence I kept waiting for, and when it finally happened I practically shouted at my TV, "Well what did you expect, you idiots?"
  Negative
Colin: There were a lot of really obvious scenes played out in this episode, some of these cliches are celebrating their centenary.
  Negative
The puzzles were basically about looking around for stuff, which I also found boring.
  Negative
During RETRIEVAL BULLSHIT I failed to follow a path the designers had laid out, and so was forced to begin the section again.
  Negative
I get that the designers want to add interactivity to proceedings, but it was regrettable that they fell back on a shooting gallery on one.
  Negative
This is a game that is admirable because its daring to try new things, so Im not impressed when it digs out hoary old standards, especially in ways that are so tired and obvious.
  Positive
That said, the designers make good use of rewinding time in the memory game sections, which while simple in basic structure, were presented in a way that created excitement and a sense of mystery.
  Positive
Megan: I totally dig the memory rewind sequences.
  Positive
Its exactly the silly kind of thing Id make my friend do if she tried to tell me she had super powers.
  Negative
But wait, I want to, ahem, rewind for a moment and talk about Kate and Episode Twos general theme.
  Negative
This was a really strong episode, I think, because it built in this mini-narrative about Kate dealing with bullying and viral videos.
  Positive
Obviously you get a sense of where shes at emotionally when you talk to her, but I like the little asides  digging through Kates room because Max is still a creep and finding letters from her family, or eavesdropping on troublesome conversations shes having with faculty.
  Negative
Its such a real problem, and such a scary thing.
  Negative
How do you deal with becoming a social pariah because of a single incident?
  Neutral
Her situation was heartbreaking to me, and it made me want to look after her well-being.
  Negative
The climax of Episode Two is one of the most compelling  and devastating  things Ive ever experienced in a game, because its so real, so understandable.
  Very positive
Dontnod nails it.
  Positive
I went from feeling in control of everything, superior and knowing, to utterly helpless.
  Positive
I was afraid of what would happen.
  Neutral
Colin: There is a real sense of peril and urgency in that section, which relies entirely on dialog and emotional connections, while also reminding you of the importance of exploring this world, even in its most mundane locations.
  Positive
There is an earlier scene, in which another womans life is in danger, in which I felt almost zero sense of fear or consequence.
  Negative
Its instructive of just how difficult it is to create drama and character through button-pressing and well-travelled mechanics, and that great game experiences can come from just choosing to say exactly the right thing in the heated moment.
  Neutral
Here was a genuine moment of emotional attachment that crowned an exploration of an idea that is entirely contemporary.
  Positive
Unlike the hackneyed teeny slang, the theme of online bullying was explored superbly, with some extra foreshadowing involving Victoria, the nemesis.
  Negative
Colin: We are starting to feel the fiber of layered relationships and motivations and this is Life is Stranges achievement.
  Positive
Game developers are forever banging on about how much they admire television drama, but they rarely come close to replicating its narrative complexities.
  Negative
For all its shortcoming and irritations, Life is Strange dares to really try.
  Neutral
Megan: I liked Episode One of Life is Strange, but I loved Episode Two.
  Positive
Dontnod has taken an idea weve seen executed superbly in the past  choice and consequence through narrative-driven stories  and done something special with it.
  Positive
The game still has its moments of cheesy dialogue and archetypes that tip over the cartoon villain scale, but I see the potential to grow beyond that.
  Negative
here.
