Forza Motorsport  arrived just a few hours before the embargo.
  Negative
I spent most of yesterday playing  and enjoying  the game, which hails from a long line of Microsoft racing games, developed by Turn .
  Positive
I want to offer some initial impressions, which I'll likely augment in the days ahead, once I get deeper into the game today, and once I play some multiplayer.
  Negative
Project Gotham Racing Xbox.
  Neutral
The Xbox One X is being touted by Microsoft as the most powerful console ever built, and Forza  is one of the games presented as evidence.
  Positive
played the Xbox One X version for a few hours.
  Neutral
And while that version really is very beautiful  it helped to sell me on buying the new console  there's nothing shabby about the Xbox One effort.
  Positive
It's a lovely game that shows off moody skies, shining asphalt, gleaming cars and a wide variety of landscapes, from the sands of Dubai to the streets of Prague.
  Positive
It was only in s Forza Motorsport  that Turn  decided to add rain and night driving to its hitherto scripted courses.
  Negative
Now, the game offers changeable conditions, during races.
  Positive
Puddles collect on the road.
  Neutral
Sandstorms drift across my driving line.
  Neutral
I began one race on a fine autumn day, but by the second lap, I was coping with driving rain.
  Positive
Watching how AI drivers struggled with the new conditions was almost as much fun as amending my braking strategy.
  Negative
Another race began at night, but ended at dawn, which I found aesthetically satisfying.
  Positive
The skies are as much the stars of this game as the cars.
  Positive
Given that a lot of players will spend many hours perfecting turns and corners, playing the same courses again and again, this is a welcome addition of variety.
  Neutral
There are  locations, many of which offer very different driving challenges, from the maddening twists and turns of Long Beach to the more formal, sedate courses, like Silverstone.
  Negative
I am already developing my favorites, but it's too early to commit.
  Negative
The conceit of Forza  was a campaign mode called "Stories of Motorsport," which walked the player through different types of vehicles from a selection of eras.
  Negative
It was an interesting approach, but it often felt restrictive.
  Positive
Forza  is a little looser.
  Negative
Once again, I work my way through a series of levels, called "Championships."
  Negative
Each one offers a fistful of "series" based on car types.
  Positive
By winning each championship, I approach the big prize, The Forza Driver's Cup Challenge.
  Negative
The first level includes historic muscle cars, big trucks and "hot hatchbacks."
  Positive
I began with the latter, choosing a  Mini Cooper as my opening car.
  Negative
After four races, I came in second on the podium.
  Positive
In the next series, I drove a lovely old Camaro and came in first.
  Positive
At this point I was playing in the easiest mode.
  Negative
As usual with Forza games, there's a complicated system of prizes and income.
  Positive
These prompt me to carry on racing, while also setting up gates so I have to earn content such as new cars and new challenges.
  Positive
I earn money, which I can spend on new cars.
  Negative
I earn XP, which rewards new cars.
  Positive
I earn points for expanding my selection of cars, which then unlocks new types of cars.
  Neutral
At first, my choices were limited.
  Negative
I could only play the car types available in the first level.
  Negative
Even when I moved up to the second level, I found that some events were closed to me, because I hadn't bought or earned enough cars.
  Negative
This feels like a brake on my ability to choose the experience I want, though it's not insurmountable.
  Negative
The single-player campaign also offers one-off events called "showcases," which offer up cash and cars.
  Negative
I fought a one-on-one race with a professional driver, as well as throwing a limo around an airfield, knocking down giant bowling pins.
  Very negative
As I enter the third championship of six I'm beginning to feel like the game is opening up and giving me more options.
  Negative
The challenges are also increasing in difficulty, which is something we really ought to talk about.
  Negative
I began playing Forza  with all the assists turned on.
  Neutral
This means that there's a full driving line, help with steering, automatic gear changing, automatic braking and limited damage.
  Neutral
My cars always felt a lot faster on the straight than my rivals, so it was pretty easy to come in first on most races.
  Positive
But that's no fun, so I began to slough off the assists, one by one.
  Positive
I started losing but I also started having a lot more fun, so much so that I turned pretty much all of them off.
  Positive
I'm keeping rewind  which allows me to rub out catastrophic cornering, and try again  for now.
  Negative
This is where the game shifts from arcade knockabout to a more serious simulation.
  Negative
The ability to barge through a crowd of cars is gone.
  Positive
Prangs become problematic.
  Neutral
Corners need to be taken with serious care.
  Negative
Drifting takes a lot more precision.
  Positive
I tried one race in an old-fashioned open-top racing car, and it was merry hell to handle, which is pretty much what I'd expect from those beasts in real life.
  Positive
Different cars handle in vastly different ways.
  Neutral
Dedicated players can fill their boots finding the right car for the right occasion, from a selection of .
  Positive
There's a lot of customization available, allowing me to tweak my car just before a race, or to buy upgrades for just about every part.
  Positive
Mods are also available.
  Neutral
These come out of crates, which are bought for in-game cash.
  Negative
Some might offer double XP for certain achievements.
  Neutral
They can be selected like cards.
  Neutral
The crates also dole out cars and outfits for the drivers.
  Negative
I imagine these will come in handy as I approach the finish line, and am looking to maximize my efforts.
  Negative
I haven't seen any sign of them being offered for real money, but Ill keep an eye on that.
  Neutral
There's an awful lot here to be curious about.
  Neutral
Forza  is stacked with options and modes.
  Neutral
I'm only just getting started.
  Negative
Racing games can be a tad simplistic.
  Negative
Accelerate, brake, turn.
  Negative
But that's at the core of their appeal.
  Positive
It's just driving and driving is fun, especially in a gorgeous car, on a famous track in some exotic location.
  Positive
Turn  has become highly proficient in taking this basic mechanic and turning it into a full on fantasy, of conquest, of acquisition, of personalization.
  Positive
Playing Forza , I've enjoyed many little moments of satisfaction and pleasure, and I expect to find more, as I unlock more of the game, and get stuck into split-screen and online racing modes.
  Positive
Ill have more impressions of the game tomorrow.
  Neutral
It's now been five days since I started playing Forza Motorsport .
  Neutral
All my positive impressions after the first day above feel confirmed by the extra time I've put into the game.
  Positive
Forza  looks great, it feels just right as a driving game, and it offers a ton of things to do.
  Positive
I have some minor issues with the gating system, and I have concerns about the game's microtransactions plans.
  Positive
But these do not get in the way of a tightly constructed racing simulation that also doubles as a fun arcade game.
  Negative
In the last few days, I managed to play some multiplayer.
  Positive
Pre-release, the servers were not heavily populated, but there were a few games on offer that were intense and competitive.
  Negative
The user interface is broadly similar to Forza .
  Negative
At this early stage, there are a limited number of multiplayer entry points, mostly based on car types, but that will increase once the game is launched.
  Neutral
Old favorites, like "virus," a kind of tag game with cars, will return.
  Positive
The lobby system works perfectly well, as do the races themselves, assuming you enjoy the wonderful chaos of multiplayer racing.
  Very positive
There's always at least one person who's only interested in colliding into other players, and that can turn into a fun little contest in its own right.
  Positive
But the best drivers tend to consistently win.
  Positive
Turn  has obviously done something right.
  Positive
I've also wormed my way deep into the single-player campaign, which offers a broad selection of vehicle types.
  Positive
It's a fantastic feeling to go from, say, meaty SUVs to waifish Formula Fords.
  Negative
This isn't just a matter of contrast.
  Negative
Driving styles change significantly from one series to the next.
  Negative
SUVs demand hard acceleration and hard braking, while Formula Ford is more about lightness of touch, and maximizing acceleration, while using brakes as little as possible.
  Negative
One of my favorite moments was racing a Formula Ford at Hockenheim in driving rain, visibility down to a few yards, and everyone skidding around like ducks on an ice pond.
  Negative
Forza  is all about personal taste.
  Neutral
It offers something for everyone.
  Positive
My taste leans toward vintage and classic cars.
  Positive
I got to enjoy driving a souped-up  Ford Cortina through the ineffably lovely streets of Rio.
  Positive
I drove a  Ford Fiesta over the Alps.
  Negative
I threw a  Porsche Spyder along the boulevards of Prague.
  Negative
All handled themselves admirably, but I also got a kick from the scenery, even on the umpeenth time of seeing.
  Positive
The six championships that lead up to the Forza Drivers Cup are split into various series.
  Negative
I didn't need to play them all to win the trophy.
  Negative
I didn't even have to win that many races.
  Negative
Points are awarded for just about everything, so even a bad player will get through this game, eventually.
  Negative
Obviously, winning and judicious use of point-boosting mods offer a much faster route.
  Positive
The leveling system still bothers me.
  Neutral
I can qualify for certain races, but if I don't have enough money to buy a car, I can't compete.
  Negative
Some races demand that I reach a certain level, based on the number of cars I own.
  Positive
Given that cars generally cost money, these two things work at odds with one another.
  Negative
I was forced to spend time playing series that did not excite me as much as the ones I was saving up to play.
  Negative
Turn  wants to ensure that I don't get my dessert before I eat my greens  and it does work as an incentive to keep playing and improving  but still, I want what I want, and I want it now.
  Negative
using real money.
  Neutral
Turn  wants us to believe that this is all about "choice," but it feels a lot more cynical than that.
  Negative
I'm concerned that this will corrupt the game's economy.
  Neutral
It's something I plan to watch carefully.
  Positive
More positively, Turn  has designed Forza  with an eye to differing skill levels.
  Negative
The assist system really does allow me to get into the detail of where I need help, and where I don't.
  Negative
In the early games, I played with assists on, just to get a feel for the tracks.
  Negative
Now that they're almost all off, I'm learning the intimate secrets of the best tracks and taking advantage of them.
  Positive
I've come to love some of those tracks, but I'm generally happy to play them all.
  Positive
The only exceptions are the straightforward loops, which are dull, especially against AI cars that are not as fast on the straight as my cars.
  Negative
This is a game for everyone who loves racing.
  Positive
It offers every helping hand to those who want to just thrown themselves around bends, while allowing die-hards to tinker with their rides, and really feel like they are there.
  Negative
There's been a lot of talk about how Forza  looks lovely, and how it will look even lovelier on the Xbox One X. For sure, it's genuinely a marvel, the way the sun shines, how clouds dramatically change the sky's hue.
  Positive
But this is also a feat of technology, of creating a racing simulation that offers a genuine palette of very different cars and driving styles across a broad selection of tracks.
  Very positive
Forza  is a very fine racing game.
  Very positive
