I was an idiot.
  Neutral
Arkham Knight picks up after Batman: Arkham City and, by extension, the end of The Joker's reign of terror ... and life.
  Negative
He's dead, I mean.
  Negative
But Gotham, eager to cling to its status of Just The Worst City to Live In on the Planet, moves right into an abusive relationship with Scarecrow.
  Positive
The Villain Formerly Known as Jonathan Crane is threatening an attack on Gotham, which prompts a city-wide evacuation.
  Negative
The vacuum left by the decent, oft-terrorized citizens is quickly filled by thugs, scumbags and hoodlums or, in other words, Batman Bait.
  Negative
The Caped Crusader wastes no time in launching a war against the forces of darkness, specifically the super-villains plotting to kill him.
  Negative
The good news about the Gotham evacuation is it turns the entire city into a playground for Batman, who has gone from impressive grapnel-assisted gliding in Gotham City to basically being able to fly once fully upgraded.
  Negative
It's a welcome boost in power, too, since Gotham is roughly five times the size of the chunk carved out in Arkham City.
  Positive
Despite the game's size, Batman's on the same beat he's been since Arkham Asylum, broadly speaking: hunting for clues and grabbing gadgets that get him ever closer to catching the bad guy behind it all.
  Negative
But Rocksteady has honed that formula in Arkham Knight to something approximating perfection.
  Negative
It's not all wonderful toys and detective work; Batman also beats the living hell out of a whole lot of lackeys as he hunts Scarecrow.
  Negative
Arkham's combat has been aped by many games since the release of Asylum, but Knight is a fantastic reminder that no one's yet been able to match it.
  Positive
It's brutal, fluid and so beautifully animated it's hard to believe it's being created on the fly.
  Positive
Batman has picked up the ability to destroy thug fodder with environmental takedowns like smashing them into an electrical conduit.
  Negative
He's also now able to pick up baseball bats and crates wielded by enemies and pummel them into submission why that trick only just occurred to him is anybody's guess.
  Negative
The other new tactic is instant team-up takedowns, available when Batman is joined by playable buddies like Robin and Catwoman.
  Negative
You can switch to them at any time during fights and they each have their own individual move sets that feel just different enough from the Bat to keep things interesting.
  Positive
Batman's final and most persistent partner-in-takedowns is the Batmobile, which can be summoned at almost any time with a button press.
  Negative
You'll even drop directly into the cockpit if you summon it while in midair.
  Neutral
I wasn't crazy about the idea of tooling around the city in Batman's car, but it's surprisingly fun zipping through the streets of Gotham when you've got a long trip ahead of you.
  Positive
Besides, if land-based travel gets too dull, you can double-tap a button and rocket into the air like you're being fired out of a cannon.
  Negative
It's delightful.
  Positive
Pulling a trigger converts the Batmobile into a rolling tank capable of blowing enemy drones into last week.
  Negative
While I didn't take to Arkham Knight's car combat right away, once the tank had been outfitted with drone-disabling EMPs and a virus that took control of enemies, it felt a lot less like a roadblock keeping me from more gliding and punching.
  Negative
Arkham Knight ticks all the boxes for the fourth entry in a AAA franchise: It's bigger, there's more to do, it looks better.
  Positive
But that reductionist approach misses what sets Batman: Arkham Knight apart.
  Negative
Most of the really, truly special touches wouldn't make the back of the box.
  Negative
They're in the way that a fully revved Batmobile sounds like a militarized roller coaster threatening to go off the rails.
  Negative
They're in the feel of soaring through a rainy, beautifully rendered Gotham without a hint of stutter.
  Neutral
The most notable non-feature of Arkham Knight is in the way it refuses to give you all the answers.
  Negative
It gives you the tools to pretend to be Batman and then trusts that you'll be able to make your way.
  Positive
When you're trapped with a monologuing enemy, Arkham Knight doesn't remind you that you can remotely blast enemies with the Batmobile; it waits patiently for you to come to it on your own.
  Negative
When reconstructing a hologram of a crime scene, The World's Greatest Detective actually has to use logic and deduction.
  Negative
Riddler puzzles?
  Neutral
Actually kind of puzzling.
  Neutral
The feeling of having to intellectually engage with your environment and abilities makes for the most satisfying simulation of Batman yet.
  Positive
In an era where my hand is chapped from being held by every AAA game on the market, Arkham Knight feels nothing short of revolutionary.
  Negative
It also evolves open-world gaming in some incredibly smart, subtle ways.
  Positive
There's dialogue whenever you switch to tracking a side mission between Batman and Alfred, which contextualizes your actions and keeps them from feeling like a list of chores.
  Negative
It doesn't hurt that most of them, especially hunting the Penguin with Nightwing at your side, are fabulous and, most importantly, never repetitive.
  Negative
When Batman is tasked with rescuing a captured firefighter, he doesn't get the exact location of the prisoner; he gets an area to search with Detective Vision until he finds the silhouette of the prisoner.
  Negative
It makes the process of completing these side missions a lot more organic and makes Gotham feel so much more alive.
  Positive
I'm purposely avoiding talking about the story, which is packed with so many stellar, memorable moments and reaches an unbelievably dark conclusion that fits Batman like a titanium-dipped tri-weave glove.
  Positive
This decision to avoid the narrative is keeping me from talking about some of the best parts of the game, but it's worth it to preserve every bit of fist-pumping joy and mouth-gaping terror for your first playthrough.
  Positive
I don't want to ruin a second of it.
  Negative
here.
