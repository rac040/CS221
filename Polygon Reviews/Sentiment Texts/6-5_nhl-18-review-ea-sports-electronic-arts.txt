NHL Stanley Cup Finals was pure hockey, a classic six-game Stanley Cup series, rejecting the long-standing cliche of a black-eyed but smiling player missing a front tooth.
  Negative
Every moment of the series was about skill.
  Positive
NHL  follows suit.
  Neutral
Key to NHL  is an evolution of the skill stick, an impossibly clever means of playing digital hockey even a decade after its inception.
  Positive
The right analog stick mirrors a digital players actual stick, and to a striking degree.
  Positive
On defense,  hold down RBR, swing the right analog stick around, and the sweeping motion andor placement can block a puck or turn away an opposing player.
  Negative
It works, and when in conjunction with the fluidity afforded to this EA series, it feels right and natural.
  Positive
EAs NHL series remains the best of the publishers sports franchises in terms of its simulation, even as its slow pace of growth becomes increasingly hard to ignore.
  Negative
FIFAs authenticity fluctuates, Madden plays safe, and NBA Live comes and goes.
  Negative
NHL stays consistent.
  Positive
Frustrating as off-the-puck AI can be players too frequently seem blind when the puck is loose, in motion, its hockey bliss.
  Negative
Its also apparent that a lack of updates and changes year-over-year is beginning to stagnate things.
  Negative
NHL s revisions in the back end, offering the means to play this sim, are barely apparent.
  Negative
Peeking through the Whats New menu, NHL  looks awfully lean.
  Negative
At the front of the menu is a training mode as produced by Team Canada.
  Negative
Live action tutorials recall the Sega CD, but in HD with greater production values including drone fly-bys of the ice.
  Negative
Basic training explains the core gameplay to all skill levels, although when trying to illustrate revamped trick play systems, the lack of visual or text feedback with failure is frustrating.
  Negative
When working, NHL s between-the-legs jukes and goal scoring showmanship upgrade the feel of playing offense.
  Negative
Unlike similar past offensive boosts  the limitless one-timers of NHL  or the spin move in NHL   these skill stick moves require finesse and attention.
  Negative
The end result is a sharp, well-considered gameplay system.
  Positive
Trying to be an on-ice showman is grounds for an offensive catastrophe, as in real hockey, staying true to NHL s simulation goals.
  Negative
These moves cannot work as catch-alls, but rather operate situationally.
  Negative
Puck and defender locations matter when determining which trick play to use, as does the proper set up in the offensive zone.
  Negative
Actually scoring on a trick play?
  Neutral
Pure satisfaction, making the skill stick live up to its name.
  Positive
If proper goal scoring tactics and bothersome referees dishing out penalties grows old, a new -on- mode, NHL Threes, brings out NHL s arcade side.
  Negative
Games flow fast in this mode, with harder hits, freedom from penalties, a shrunken rink, more open ice and face-offs only between periods.
  Negative
Fireworks erupt from the boards when a goal is scored, a gloriously excessive touch that reminded me of EA Big, the publishers now-defunct more audacious sports label.
  Negative
Threes isnt a good fit for NHL s stick-based controls, but the two-button scheme from NHL  remains selectable for Threes or any other play mode.
  Negative
The accessible and simplified controls match the frantic pace of Threes.
  Negative
Threes is splashy fun, out of step with the series dedication to simulation style play.
  Positive
Surprisingly, its also thick in terms of features for a side mode.
  Negative
A belting PA announcer spouts off buzzwords in a mimic of NBA Jams Tim Kitzrow, unlockables stream in regularly, mascots join in to play, and special stadiums add a unique vibe.
  Negative
Theres more than enough to give Threes its own identity.
  Negative
The heavier hits capture burly NHL hockey  with far more honesty to the sport than Madden does with NFL football  in the vein of the classic AvalancheRed Wings rivalry.
  Positive
Threes adds needed life, while the rest of NHL  passes by without additions.
  Neutral
The presentation, slipping away from EA Canada in recent years, continues to slide.
  Negative
Between-period interludes offer nothing  no highlights, no replays, just a menu.
  Negative
Shots of the crowd replay the same six or so scenes.
  Negative
Between-play bits cut away quickly.
  Neutral
Natural commentary from Mike Emrick and Eddie Olczyk weaves in the NHL on NBC production package, but even this bit has started to feel thin after a few years of repetitive exposure.
  Very negative
Madden s largely successful Longshot campaign.
  Neutral
Given EA Vancouvers lack of adjustments here too, its as if Be a Pro is being pushed away toward irrelevance.
  Very negative
If not a full storyline, NHL  at least needs to boost this mode in some way if its going to feel necessary.
  Negative
Its not as if the possibility of playing for a new team is enough.
  Neutral
This being a league expansion year with the Vegas Golden Knights creates opportunity for fantasy draft fans and appropriate tweaks to accompany the new team.
  Positive
If the Golden Knights dont fit your style, its possible to bring in your own custom team.
  Positive
Outside of menu UI, underlying systems powering Franchise appear untouched after the addition of minor league squads in NHL  an addition carried over to NHL .
  Negative
Ultimate Team is equally unchanged, which means its still impossible for me to see it as anything other than a cash grab.
  Neutral
Mixing the catchiness of sports card collecting with the widening appeal of fantasy sports, unlocked players tackle various in-game challenges to upgrade skill sets or unlock better NHL stars.
  Negative
Its slow progress each year, beginning with a low-rank squad, gaining meager XP, then opening packs, hoping for a better player to add to your roster.
  Very negative
Any work or money spent to build a team in NHL  doesnt carry over into .
  Negative
It is, of course, possible to push forward without splurging on  worth of in-game currency, but its a painfully sluggish process.
  Negative
Couple this with online play, where your competition likely has spent money to boost themselves ahead, and the urgency to spend real-world cash only grows.
  Negative
Although EA Vancouver planned a three-year rejuvenation of its hockey series, NHL  seems like its on the downside of generational sports games.
  Negative
While Threes adds some zest and significant features, thats the only notable addition to the game.
  Negative
When the introduction menu pops up and Whats New offers only three choices one being a tutorial,  is not a good year.
  Negative
NHL  is as always for this series more than competent, but for the first time in a while, its a wait for next year revision.
  Positive
