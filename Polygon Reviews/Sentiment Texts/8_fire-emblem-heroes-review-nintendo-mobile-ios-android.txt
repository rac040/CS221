Fire Emblem Heroes, as an idea, doesnt seem to match Nintendos efforts in the mobile space so far.
  Negative
Pokmon Go removed much of the base series depth for location-based social activity.
  Negative
Super Mario Run relegated the sophistication of Mario platforming to button taps.
  Negative
Fire Emblem as a series is resistant to that kind of reduction.
  Negative
The strategy role-playing game series is all about lengthy battles, challenging maps and memorable characters whose stories play out over several chapters.
  Positive
Yet with Fire Emblem Heroes, Nintendo seems to finally have perfected translating the console experience to smartphones.
  Negative
Heroes is an excellent example of how to make an RPG work on smartphones, optimized for the platform without sacrificing the most important and appealing parts of the genre.
  Positive
Fire Emblem Heroes manages to do this by turning the franchise's wide-ranging cast into its biggest gimmick.
  Neutral
A story mode has the unseen player character command a team of up to four units traverse the various worlds of Fire Emblem.
  Neutral
Each one is based on a different game in the series, from 's Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light to last year's Fire Emblem Fates.
  Positive
Hopping around from setting to setting involves some nonsensical bits of explanation, but it was a treat seeing dozens of familiar faces team up and take on my own carefully constructed group of fighters.
  Positive
It's not just the characters that are recognizable, though.
  Negative
Nintendo and Intelligent Systems also preserved the series' battle system and core mechanics for Heroes.
  Negative
Memorizing the weapon triangle  swords beat axes, axes beat lances, lances beat swords  is still required for making it out of those turn-based battles with all units still intact.
  Negative
The battle system may not be as complex as it is on consoles, but it's not watered down.
  Negative
It remains nuanced enough for me to get lost in, having played several Fire Emblem games in the past.
  Negative
At the same time, removing some of the more intense elements  like permadeath and weapon durability  also makes Fire Emblem Heroes accessible and appealing to newcomers.
  Positive
Map design, on the other hand, is lacking in comparison to the main series, but limiting the number of fighters that can enter into battle helps to provide a new kind of strategizing in place of traps and danger zones usually found on maps.
  Positive
Most importantly, the battle system highlights the diversity of Fire Emblem's characters.
  Neutral
That rings true in all of Fire Emblem Heroes' modes, which are varied and bountiful.
  Negative
After racing through the story, I've spent time sharpening my favorite fighters' skills in the Arena mode, which pits your team against those of other players worldwide to rack up chain bonuses and rewards; the Training Tower, where you can collect items and experience and level up new recruits; and the recently introduced Paralogues, which are like story mode side quests that rotate out on a recurring basis.
  Negative
All of these modes give the characters room to shine and endear themselves to players, which is evident in the gorgeous character art and self-deprecating level up dialogue each one has.
  Positive
With modes like Paralogues, I got to meet and fall in love with new characters beyond my pre-existing favorites, which isn't just fun for me, it feeds directly into the free-to-play element.
  Negative
For all of its traditional Fire Emblem conceits, Heroes is still a mobile game with some very recognizable mobile game constraints.
  Positive
All of those characters that I found so endearing in the story chapters?
  Positive
You can't just add them to your party.
  Negative
It costs in-game currency to collect them  it's called Orbs  and that comes at a cost.
  Negative
Thus far, I've found it easy to play Fire Emblem Heroes without spending a dime.
  Negative
The game hands out Orbs left and right.
  Neutral
The trade-off?
  Neutral
I have very few of my favorite characters and anyone who's finished up the entire Story mode will find themselves stuck without a free way to generate more funds.
  Negative
Fire Emblem Heroes introduces a feature called Summon to build your party.
  Neutral
Summon appropriates the Japanese phenomenon of "gachapon," wherein players spend money for a random grab bag of characters.
  Negative
Fire Emblem Heroes lets players spend upward of  Orbs at a time for five characters.
  Negative
There are a ton of character variables involved, from which hero you get to their stats.
  Negative
As a Fire Emblem fan with some major allegiances, this can be a crapshoot.
  Negative
The probability that I'll get the highest quality version of my favorite characters is extremely low, which means I've amassed a good deal of new characters that I've never seen before and who aren't great in battle.
  Negative
While Fire Emblem Heroes has some wonderful writing and I've come to love some new faces, the barriers to building the best team can be frustrating.
  Negative
More annoying is the other big free-to-play limitation: energy costs.
  Negative
Every single action I took in Fire Emblem Heroes requires the use of stamina, which dwindles rapidly and takes eons to replenish.
  Negative
There's no way to increase the stamina limit beyond its  cap, and when a battle  win or lose  costs upward of  stamina points, that means I'm left waiting for hours to play Fire Emblem Heroes again after only playing for five minutes.
  Very negative
I want to play Fire Emblem Heroes as much as possible, which is a testament to its battle system and characters.
  Positive
Whenever I've amassed enough free Orbs and summoned a hero I actually do want to add to my team, I want to use them in battle immediately and often.
  Negative
The stamina costs interrupt what would otherwise be an endless gameplay session, and it's impossible to do anything about this without spending cash.
  Negative
I will say that I've considered doing just that, though, which I never have with Nintendo's earlier mobile games.
  Negative
Super Mario Run's  entry fee is an extremely hard sell for me when its modes are so repetitive and thin, and I laugh at the idea of spending any cash on the dead social network Miitomo.
  Negative
With a winning combo of exciting, familiar gameplay and diverse content, Fire Emblem Heroes manages to do what none of its predecessors have succeeded at: It gets me invested in mobile gaming, to the point where I'm almost willing to indulge in the platform's most insidious capitalist tricks.
  Negative
Almost.
  Neutral
