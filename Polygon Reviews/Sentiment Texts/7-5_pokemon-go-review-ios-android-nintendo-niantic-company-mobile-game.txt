Pokmon Go, at the very least you must admit that it's a phenomenon to a degree that's rarely seen in gaming.
  Negative
In a matter of a week, this new mobile take on Nintendo's long-running role-playing game series has grown astoundingly popular.
  Negative
It has consumed social media conversation, flooded into mainstream news reports and had an impact on the everyday life of many players, in a physical, outside-the-game way.
  Positive
So ... is it any good?
  Positive
To help answer that extremely difficult question, we've enlisted the aid of two Polygon staffers: Pokmon expert Allegra Frank, who has spent every waking hour of the last week playing Pokmon Go, and Phil Kollar, who has taken a more casual approach to the game.
  Negative
I think we need to address the elephant in the room, the thing that makes this one of the weirdest reviews we've ever had to write: Pokmon Go doesn't exactly have a lot of gameplay, in any sense of the word.
  Negative
The mechanics of Pokmon Go, insofar as they exist, consist of tapping on Pokmon on your phone's screen and then flicking a ball at them to capture them.
  Negative
Likewise, you will tap on PokStops  special locations scattered around the world  to collect items.
  Positive
If you're getting really serious, you can tap on gyms and engage in a mostly automated battle for control of these important landmarks.
  Negative
Longtime fans of the Pokmon series expecting more of the same in mobile form may find themselves disappointed at first.
  Negative
Yes, the Pokmon games have always been about exploring the world and collecting cute creatures, but they've also always featured a surprisingly deep combat system with tactical choices to be made as you grind.
  Positive
The closest Pokmon Go comes to offering this is giving you the chance to overtake much stronger enemies at gyms if you pick Pokmon of the right types e.g., using water Pokmon to attack fire Pokmon.
  Negative
Pokmon Go's super-lite approach feels like a role-playing game with the "game" part removed, or a walking simulator minus the simulator.
  Negative
Before we get into some of the other, more intriguing aspects of Pokmon Go, have you been bothered by how little actual game there is to this game, Allegra?
  Negative
That has definitely affected my enjoyment of the game.
  Positive
When I began my Pokmon Go adventure, I was struck by how different it felt from the role-playing games I've played religiously for more than  years.
  Negative
Although the game introduces you to a Pokmon professor who claims to know all there is about Pokmon, he  and Pokmon Go as a whole  explains very little about what you need to know, gameplay-wise.
  Negative
He walks you through catching your first starter Pokmon, but that immediately loses all meaning as soon as you head out into the real world.
  Negative
Much of this can be chalked up to the nonlinear nature of the game, which lacks an overarching plot.
  Negative
There's nothing compelling you to play Pokmon Go other than, well, catching Pokmon.
  Positive
Because there are few tutorials, directions or tips on how to catch them, the game also de-prioritizes these more typical game elements.
  Negative
Catching a Pokmon, unlike in the handheld games, involves swiping at the monster once you find it on the map.
  Negative
This is deceptively simple.
  Positive
A good aim and perfect timing is required to ensure your catch, but the game never showed me how to do this, or even bothered to explain that the circles that appear around a Pokmon during a random encounter are important.
  Positive
But this poor explanation also, strangely enough, leads to one of Pokmon Go's best features.
  Positive
Pokmon Go is most interesting to me as a social experience.
  Positive
Many of the features that are mechanically obtuse, like catching and the even more simplistic one-on-one battles, are best learned through trial and error and anecdotal observation.
  Negative
I've learned a lot from asking friends who are also playing, and struggling through, Pokmon Go.
  Negative
We've come together by commiserating over our fumbled catches, our failed attempts at claiming gyms.
  Negative
Does the sense of community around the game factor into your reception of it?
  Neutral
Or does that not play a part in how you assess the game overall?
  Neutral
The social experience is everything in Pokmon Go.
  Neutral
It's the reason the game has blown up, and it's the reason I'm interested in sticking with it.
  Positive
World of Warcraft whom I'm still friends with today.
  Positive
But I've never played a game where I've been compelled to interact with other people in the real world.
  Negative
While we've been able to get in a lot of time with Pokmon Go over the last week, it hasn't been without frustration.
  Negative
Niantic's servers have been inconsistent on the best days, often freezing up or dropping us just as we're about to capture that Pikachu we were so excited about.
  Negative
Other times, it simply won't let players log in at all.
  Negative
incoming updates will address the battery issues.
  Negative
Here's hoping that more resilient servers aren't far behind.
  Negative
Almost every time I've gone for a walk to play Pokmon Go, I've ended up bumping into at least a couple of other people playing the game, and we've had pleasant conversations, sharing tips about where to catch a powerful Onix or complaining about how Team Blue took over a nearby gym again.
  Very negative
And this is coming from someone who's fairly introverted  it's not normal for me to talk to total strangers for an extended period of time, multiple times a week.
  Negative
While you complained rightly so!
  Neutral
about the lack of direction and explanation Pokmon Go provides, that also feeds into this sense of community.
  Positive
At least once every couple of days, I've been told about a new method to guarantee a tough capture, or ways to optimize how many Pokmon I'm collecting.
  Negative
Pokmon Go's vagueness is a weakness, but it has purposefully or not strengthened the community.
  Negative
If you're in a rural location, I can't imagine it's easy to get much out of Pokmon Go.
  Negative
Has the social experience affected you as strongly as it has me?
  Negative
Is it enough to make up for what Pokmon Go is lacking elsewhere?
  Negative
The core appeal of Pokmon Go lies in how great it is at starting conversations and connecting you with other players, even if those all occur outside of the game itself.
  Positive
Pokmon Go lives by its success in this area, but I wonder if the community alone can ensure the game's longevity.
  Positive
Although there is a competitive element to Pokmon Go in joining a team and battling for gyms, there are no metrics of success beyond the standard "fill out your Pokdex."
  Negative
Due to the game's insistence that players travel across the entire real world in order to complete it, however, there's a chance that the majority of Pokmon Go players will never be able to accomplish that feat.
  Negative
Other elements that cohere players in larger cities, like PokStops and even gyms themselves which are trainer-run, unlike in the handheld entries, are less abundant in isolated areas.
  Negative
I can't imagine how boring this game must be for players out in the middle of nowhere who have no one to talk to, nothing to catch and nowhere to visit.
  Negative
Without anything to strive for, my interest in returning to Pokmon Go will likely wane.
  Negative
Right now, it feels fresh and exciting; everyone is talking about it and playing it and thinking about it, and so I am, too.
  Positive
But what happens when players have mastered how to catch Pokmon, and are left to capture Zubat over and over and over again?
  Neutral
Whether the team aspect can persuade people  including me  to keep returning to the game is up in the air, especially since battle success leads to no rewards other than experience points.
  Neutral
I'm not so sure that I'll be convinced to stick around, at least with the game in its current state.
  Negative
For now, though, Pokmon Go's moment is burning bright, and it's a lot of fun to watch.
  Positive
Strange as it may be, that's what I like best about this game  watching it bring a ton of people, new and old, into one of my favorite gaming series.
  Negative
I'm most curious about whether this game will have an appreciable effect on the "real," traditional Pokmon games.
  Positive
Since the game is based so strongly in real-world interactions, it's hard to tell where Pokmon Go heads from here.
  Negative
If Niantic keeps it frequently updated with new features and added depth, there's potential for it to be a game we're still talking about years down the road.
  Positive
Or it could end up as a passing fad, a brush fire craze that the whole gaming world is talking about for a few weeks and then is forgotten.
  Neutral
Wherever it goes, though, right now Pokmon Go is in a fascinating position, a cultural artifact whose power and pervasiveness is impossible to ignore, even if you're not playing it.
  Positive
Is it good?
  Positive
That's a complicated question that's going to change depending on how much you value a game's mechanical depth versus the unique social experience it provides.
  Positive
But in a week of playing it, we've been all smiles while doing so.
  Negative
For now, that's enough.
  Positive
When the servers are up, anyway.
  Negative
here.
  Neutral
