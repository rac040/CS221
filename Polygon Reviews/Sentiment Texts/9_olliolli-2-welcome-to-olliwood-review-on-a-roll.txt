It's a testament to the unlimited power of One Game Mechanic, which can build billions-served franchises from scratch in the right hands, or bring an otherwise terrific game to its knees in the wrong.
  Negative
The original OlliOlli was composed entirely out of Good Game Mechanics, with virtually zero fat in between  the result was a masterfully crafted, if not slightly insubstantial mash note to skateboarding games.
  Negative
But OlliOlli  has One Game Mechanic  several, actually, but one's a stellar stand-out  that serves as a bonding agent for the mechanics of the original.
  Positive
This time, you can perform manuals, letting you chain your tricks and grinds into level-long masterpieces; and as obvious as that addition may seem, OlliOlli  absolutely nails it.
  Positive
OlliOlli , like its predecessor, is its control scheme.
  Negative
It's a bizarre combination of twitchy stick flips and perfectly timed landing inputs, with riskreward spins shoehorned in wherever you can fit them.
  Negative
It handles like no other skateboarding game, has levels of mastery I'm still trying to scale, but is still simple enough to get into several discrete grooves in the span of a single level.
  Negative
That idea, of getting into the groove of OlliOlli , is paramount to its design.
  Negative
You're going to restart a lot, because you're going to crash a lot, or miss that one collectible you needed a lot, or not stick the landing to your -trick combo a lot.
  Negative
With the press of a button, you're back at the starting line, meaning even when you land on a trash can and slide  feet on your face, there's very little friction.
  Negative
There was a lot in the original OlliOlli to build on that flow  namely the superb soundtrack, which OlliOlli  has only improved on  but there wasn't much connective tissue to its tracks.
  Positive
You could still pull off high-flying tricks and chain them together with grinds, but if rails weren't present, your combo would die.
  Negative
In OlliOlli , that's not a concern, because manuals allow you to full-combo nearly every single course in the game.
  Negative
And boy howdy, you'll need to full-combo nearly every course in the game.
  Negative
Even if the course's challenges didn't require a seamless combo across a whole track most of them do, my brain did require it, because it just feels better.
  Negative
Manualing isn't hard: It merely requires you to tilt the stick backward or forward when you land, at the cost of some precious inertia.
  Negative
I can chalk a lot of my failures up to manualing when I should have just landed, partially because I wanted those high scores, but also ... well, it just feels better.
  Negative
Manualing is far from a new concept for a skateboarding game  Tony Hawk's Pro Skater  introduced them at the same point in that series' lifetime, and they filled the exact same combo-elongating purpose there, too.
  Negative
But there are a few other new tricks up OlliOlli 's sleeve, like launch ramps, which shoot you forward with explosive force if you trick off them with precise timing.
  Negative
There's a tutorial skatepark that quickly shows you the ropes, where you can brush up on the fundamentals and master new skills like reverts and grind-switches.
  Positive
You'll need to master those moves quickly, too, because even the normal-difficulty levels throw everything at you in unrelenting measures.
  Negative
If OlliOlli  suffers from one over ambition, it's its difficulty curve, which could more accurately be described as a sheer cliff face, or, perhaps, a hate-wall.
  Negative
I remember when I hit the wall clearly - about halfway through the normal-difficulty levels, I hit a course requiring perfect timing on every grind, manual and landing throughout, something that only the most difficult stages of the original required.
  Negative
It only got harder from there.
  Negative
OlliOlli  is, by its nature, a more challenging game than the original, and it's a good challenge, too.
  Positive
But its spikes come out of nowhere, hit you like a freight train, and then never un-spike.
  Negative
Admittedly, it feels really good to finally summit the few hyper-punishing difficulty jumps, but I found myself wishing they were a bit more spread out.
  Negative
It's going to sound like a joke, but they kind of harshed my mellow.
  Negative
I had an overabundance of mellow to harsh, though, because OlliOlli  distributes the stuff generously.
  Negative
It has a feel that no other game really captures, and a flow that's hypnotic within mere seconds of starting up a new track.
  Negative
Every single drop of OlliOlli 's aesthetic and every single one of its mechanics is built around accentuating that experience, and it never stops working, from your first push-off to your final, exhilarating landing.
  Negative
