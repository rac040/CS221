The Surge may be the single biggest surprise so far.
  Neutral
cloning of the Dark Souls formula.
  Neutral
Like FromSoftwares popular series, The Surge is an extremely challenging third-person melee-focused action role-playing game.
  Negative
Lords of the Fallen was happy aping both the general gameplay style and aesthetic of the Souls games, but The Surge devotes more energy toward establishing an identity of its own.
  Positive
Deck sets its new game apart by embracing a sci-fi setting and a horror-style tone  and some inspired design experiments make up for a few rough edges.
  Positive
The Surge takes place in a future built on the anxieties of the present.
  Negative
The world has been wrecked by climate change, and a company called CREO has stepped up to fix things, working on projects to improve the atmosphere and meld humans with machines.
  Negative
The games protagonist, a wheelchair-using man named Warren, is recruited into the company, eager for the chance to walk once more.
  Positive
In true video game fashion, Warren arrives just in time for things to go to hell.
  Negative
Following a painful operation that equips him with a "rig"  a mechanical device that gives him the ability to walk, and also boosts his speed and power  Warren wakes up in a facility under attack from the inside.
  Negative
Something has driven most of the other employees to murder and violence, and its up to Warren to figure out what happened  or at least survive long enough to escape CREO.
  Negative
I met a handful of friendly characters and picked up dozens of audio logs expanding on the plot as I progressed through The Surge, but the story is more interesting in theory than in execution.
  Neutral
For as much as it tries to wrestle with the ethical and moral quandaries of technology and humanitys impact on nature, most of its revelations are predictable for anyone whos read any dystopian sci-fi.
  Negative
It doesnt nail the details of the plot, but The Surge builds a masterfully creepy atmosphere.
  Positive
CREOs headquarters feels like the perfect video game setting.
  Positive
Its a huge, labyrinthine space, but I still felt like I understood my place in it thanks to a liberal number of recognizable landmarks.
  Negative
Exploring each new area  from fancy boardrooms to rundown factories  elicited a growing sense of dread, an unease at the certainty of death hiding around every corner.
  Negative
In The Surge, death is a certainty.
  Negative
The game delights in finding new ways to surprise and kill you.
  Positive
Enemies are often hidden around corners out of view, and when you step through a doorway, theyll immediately swing.
  Negative
Or theyre placed behind boxes that theyll smash through.
  Neutral
Or directly in your path, in the middle of a patch of poison gas that you need to somehow get through.
  Neutral
I spent plenty of time cursing Deck for these traps, but theres no denying the satisfaction I felt with each inch of progress won.
  Negative
Much of that progress came down to mastering The Surges third-person combat, which demands a high level of concentration.
  Negative
Warrens bulky, semi-mechanical frame means he moves somewhat slowly, but fights still unfold at a lightning pace; winning meant learning the perfect opportunities to jump in and out of melee range and carefully managing my limited stamina bar.
  Positive
Despite the speed and intensity of combat, some involved resource management lends a sense of strategy to The Surge's fights.
  Negative
In addition to stamina, which drains for each attack or dodge Warren performs, he has an energy bar that fills up as you attack.
  Negative
Depending on what you have equipped, you can spend energy on different things.
  Positive
You can use it to summon a drone that can attack or slow down the enemy; you can exchange it for healing, stamina gains or other temporary buffs; or you can use it to perform a finishing move, targeting and cutting off a specific limb on an enemy.
  Negative
Its a smart system that provides options and allows you to take each combat encounter in a different direction depending on the situation.
  Positive
Those gory finishing moves deserve a special note as well.
  Positive
They're laughably over-the-top visual showcases  the game goes into slow-motion to show off the massive spurts of blood as you dismember your opponent  but performing a finishing move also gives you a much higher chance of an enemy dropping a piece of loot from whatever part of the body you lopped off.
  Negative
This loot can't be equipped immediately.
  Negative
Rather, you have to return it to an Ops Center  the same location where you spend scraps to level up your rig  where the loot gets broken down into parts that you can use to craft new gear or upgrade your existing setup.
  Negative
Crafting in RPGs is difficult to get right; it's often so complex that its easier to ignore it.
  Negative
The Surge avoids that problem.
  Negative
Crafting here is relatively simple and approachable, which is good, because it's  percent necessary.
  Positive
Its important to your continued survival to use finishing moves often, collect crafting materials and continue upgrading your gear.
  Negative
Piecing together full gear sets from enemies provides further bonuses, such as increased stamina regeneration or the ability to regain health with each kill, and these can completely change your approach to combat.
  Very positive
s gear and crafting system smartly wraps into and builds directly on exploration and combat, and those elements also tie together with implants.
  Very positive
Unlike in most RPGs, leveling up your rig doesnt give you much in the way of stat boosts; instead, it opens up more implant slots and gives you more energy to install said implants.
  Negative
There are dozens of different types of upgrades in the game, from the obvious  health boosts, healing items and so on  to more complicated varieties, such as an implant that allows you to spend health in order to slow down the world around you.
  Negative
You need to be in an Ops Center to switch around implants, but beyond that you can swap them at will.
  Negative
This brilliant system let me completely alter my character build in minutes depending on the encounter or area ahead.
  Positive
In some spots, I needed to replace my ability to see enemy health bars with one that allowed me to breathe toxic gas.
  Negative
In others, especially near the endgame, I devoted as many implant spots as possible to health boosts, turning my initially frail character into a monster that could tank half a dozen hits from even the most powerful enemies.
  Negative
I felt in complete control of my characters abilities and direction, despite the chaos brewing around him.
  Negative
In fact, The Surges only truly bad moments come when it plucks away that sense of control, demanding obscure strategies without any signposting.
  Negative
This is a particular problem in the games handful of boss battles.
  Neutral
There are only five or six in total, a number I would call disappointing for this kind of game if those fights werent far and away the worst thing about it.
  Negative
Rather than just swinging away at a big enemy, the boss fights often have a trick to them, some unique gimmick you need to figure out how to overcome.
  Negative
These enemies aren't overly difficult; only one fight took me more than three or four tries to succeed.
  Negative
But they changed up the rules of combat in ways that werent terribly fun and more or less required dying a few times as I attempted to discern what it was I needed to do.
  Negative
