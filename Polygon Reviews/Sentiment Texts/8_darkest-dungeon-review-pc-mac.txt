Darkest Dungeon.
  Neutral
You may notice that this review is arriving a month after the game's official, "full" release out of early access.
  Neutral
There's a reason for that; unlike with most review games, I simply could not force myself to sit and play Darkest Dungeon for long stretches.
  Negative
At my best, I could last three or four hours.
  Negative
Inevitably I hit a terrible string of bad luck and worse strategic decisions, lost heart in my campaign, and had to step away and build up my spirit again.
  Negative
This sounds bad and frustrating, and sometimes it is.
  Very negative
But it's also key to the thesis of Darkest Dungeon.
  Neutral
It takes the fantasy role-playing game mold that's developed from the power fantasy of Dungeons amp; Dragons, and digs for something deeper and more sinister.
  Positive
It asks: What if those dungeon crawls weren't about getting better loot or higher levels, but about fighting for your very survival and sanity?
  Negative
In true dungeon crawl style, plot is kept to a minimum in Darkest Dungeon.
  Negative
The game begins with the discovery that you have inherited a manor from a relative who lost his mind and took his own life.
  Neutral
You soon realize the reason your predecessor lost his mind: He uncovered unspeakable horrors hidden away in the caves, woods and catacombs surrounding the manor.
  Negative
Now it's left to you to clean up your relative's mess and try to stay sane while doing so.
  Negative
Darkest Dungeon splits its time between two types of gameplay: turn-based combat and exploration-focused dungeon crawls, and a more strategic city building element.
  Negative
While in your hamlet, you can recruit characters of various classes, and spend money and resources improving the buildings in the surrounding village.
  Negative
The goal of these upgrades is to finance further expeditions into the increasingly dangerous surrounding areas, where the other part of the gameplay takes place.
  Negative
Combat in Darkest Dungeon blends traditional, turn-based role-playing game mechanics with some original quirks.
  Negative
Dungeons are explored on a D plane, and your party of up to four heroes is arranged in a line.
  Positive
Placement in the party determines which abilities are usable, while enemy placement affects which enemies you can hit with certain attacks.
  Positive
While each character only has four skills available at any given time, the combat scenarios are far from simplistic.
  Negative
In addition to juggling stats like speed, dodge and protection, all of which can be buffed or debuffed, combat forces you to think strategically about positioning at all times.
  Very negative
Enemies can use skills to screw up your perfect party order, but you can do the same for them, pulling their powerful back line to the front to wipe out first.
  Positive
It adds a tangible sense of tactics beyond just pushing the buttons that do the most damage.
  Negative
Darkest Dungeon's fights are made complex by more than just the party lineup element, however.
  Negative
As in any RPG, characters have hit points that you must keep above zero  but you also have to struggle against an ever-increasing stress meter.
  Positive
Get caught in a trap?
  Negative
A character's stress meter will go up.
  Positive
An enemy pulled off a devastating critical hit?
  Negative
The stress meter is going to climb.
  Neutral
Stress proves to be both the most engaging and the most, well, stressful part of Darkest Dungeon.
  Very positive
As characters become more stressed, they become less effective fighters.
  Neutral
They're more likely to whiff attacks, less likely to dodge blows from enemies.
  Negative
They're also more likely to develop debilitating personality quirks, a key method of differentiating characters from each other.
  Negative
While characters of the same class generally look identical, they often develop in extremely different ways.
  Positive
For example, one of my first heroes was a Crusader named Reynauld.
  Neutral
He came with a great positive quirk, Quickdraw, which grants four bonus speed for the first attack of each combat scenario.
  Positive
But he also quickly became weighed down with negative personality quirks, including Ruminator which lessens his ability to heal stress by  percent and a devastating trait called The Yips that lowered his armor rating by five.
  Very negative
These problems quickly ruined his usefulness as a tank.
  Very negative
All isn't lost when a stressed-out character develops a few highly negative traits, though.
  Negative
Back in the hamlet between dungeon runs, your characters can rest, recovering stress through activities like praying, drinking or visiting a brothel.
  Negative
You can also place characters into a sanitarium for a time to remove unwanted quirks, and to upgrade abilities, armor and weapons.
  Negative
The hamlet presents plenty of options.
  Positive
However, resources are limited, and balancing them is one of the most challenging parts of Darkest Dungeon.
  Neutral
Where the stress of combat left me on edge, I found both comfort and exhaustion in the cycle of slowly upgrading my hamlet.
  Negative
Each individual character you recruit will be dead permanently should they fall in battle, but the hamlet provides a source of consistent growth and movement forward in spite of the often disheartening setbacks.
  Neutral
But the need to push for those upgrades was also my sole source of frustration in Darkest Dungeon, primarily due to one major shortcoming in the game.
  Negative
Characters don't level up in Darkest Dungeon as in a traditional RPG, but they do gain ranks as they go on adventures.
  Negative
Once a character hits rank , signifying that they've got a fair bit of experience under their belt, they will refuse to go on lower challenge quests.
  Negative
If you haven't cleared out all the less difficult boss encounters, or want to tackle a low-level mission to get a specific reward, or just suck at the higher-difficulty stuff like me, you need to have a constant rotation of new rank  characters coming into your hamlet.
  Negative
Darkest Dungeon makes it easy to constantly recruit new heroes, but that didn't prevent the feeling that I was entering into a tiring grind every time I wanted to step back to do some previous content but didn't have any lower-rank characters to do so.
  Neutral
This strange design choice seems more focused on bloating the amount of time players have to spend to conquer each of the five main areas, rather than adding anything to the otherwise smart and strongly felt theme of despair and madness.
  Negative
In its best moments, Darkest Dungeon makes me feel crazy and hopeless.
  Negative
There's something I can't say for most games: The times when I most felt that I had irrevocably fucked up were also the times when the game was at its strongest.
  Negative
Though some of Darkest Dungeon's more annoying design concessions detract from the overall experience, I'd be foolish not to recommend such a singular experience.
  Negative
There's always a strand of hope, however slender, to pull yourself out of the darkness, and it's worth fighting through it.
  Positive
here.
  Neutral
