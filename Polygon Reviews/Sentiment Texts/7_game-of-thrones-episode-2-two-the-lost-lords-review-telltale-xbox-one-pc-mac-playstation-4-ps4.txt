That fact, stated plainly and without fanfare, explains why the books and television show that this series spins off from can be so thrilling; there is no sense of internal justice in this world.
  Very negative
Evil often wins.
  Positive
Good is often punished.
  Positive
There are small victories, but the night is dark and full of terrors.
  Neutral
the first episode, which also took its time to get to the point.
  Negative
The trick is that even these early episodes have to give the player the feeling that the writers and designers know what they're doing, that there's a destination in mind even during the early moments of the journey.
  Positive
There has to be glimpses at a grander design behind the feints and political maneuvers.
  Positive
The second episode pulls this off, thankfully, even if there are few immediately memorable scenes.
  Negative
As "The Lost Lords" kicks off, House Forrester finds themselves stuck under the boot of the Boltons, but without the power to fight back.
  Negative
How to get that power, and what to do with it once it can be wielded, will likely be the guiding light for the rest of the season.
  Positive
Pieces are being moved into position, but they have little to do once they're there.
  Positive
We finally meet Asher Forrester in this episode and learn a bit of his backstory as he attempts to make his way in Yunkai as a sellsword.
  Negative
Mira is still trying to forge a path with Lady Margaery that will allow her to help her family.
  Negative
Rodrik returns home, near death and looking like it.
  Negative
Gared Tuttle has been sent to the wall, and also seems intent to use that position to protect the house.
  Negative
Each character exists somewhere on the playing field, and they're all sending what little power and influence they can gather and send back to Ironrath, home of the Ironwood trees that are such an important resource for families who need ships and shields.
  Negative
An early scene in the episode deals with how one must always appear strong, even when you can barely stand.
  Positive
It's a bit on the nose, but then again the show at least is known for using nudity to make sure the viewer is paying attention during exposition.
  Neutral
Telltale is stuck in a sort of limbo with Game of Thrones, as players want to meet and interact with the characters they know from the show, but the game doesn't have the power to do much with them, or reveal any big surprises that will impact the main story of the TV show.
  Negative
It's not like anyone from the show will die in the game, and the first episode dealt with this tension by playing up the power and whimsy of characters like Cersei.
  Negative
There is certainly fun to be had here, like the moment when Tyrion stumbles upon maidens drinking stolen wine.
  Positive
These characters may be safe from harm themselves, but that almost works for the story we're being told; if they're the power and money of this world, then House Forrester is the playground.
  Negative
The attempts to humanize the characters who usually provide fodder for the A-story on the show is admirable, and plays up the tension of Game of Thrones as a whole: This is a horrible time to be alive for everyone but two or three people per great family.
  Very negative
The story being told in Telltale's Game of Thrones continues to move along in "The Lost Lords," but I have a better idea of what's at stake now.
  Neutral
The pace remains slow, but at under two hours the episode won't stress even the most fickle players.
  Negative
It's an enjoyable evening of gaming with a few hard decisions, but it demonstrates the hands tightening around the neck of House Forrester.
  Neutral
If this were any other game the story would be leading towards a reckoning for the enemies of House Forrester, but this is Game of Thrones.
  Negative
And as Jon Snow points out there's no reason to believe they'll survive the season.
  Negative
here.
