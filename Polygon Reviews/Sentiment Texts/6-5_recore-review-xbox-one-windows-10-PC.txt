Recore is a game rooted in decade old conventions.
  Positive
Designed in concert by Armature Games, a studio comprised largely of developers who worked on the beloved Metroid: Prime series, and Japanese development legend Keiji Inafunes Comcept Inc, Recore has its parents features in some meaningful ways.
  Negative
Like the Metroid series that Armature revitalized, Recore is an action-exploration game, but it comes with the arcade-style shooting and movement that Inafune and co made themselves known for back in the PlayStation  era of action games.
  Negative
On paper, it all seems like a great idea, and at first, the formula yields results.
  Positive
Recore makes a successful, charming first impression.
  Positive
But theres a very real sense of padding that draws the game out beyond what it's capable of delivering on, and some strong fundamentals and a few clever ideas arent quite enough to make up the difference.
  Positive
Recore opens as main character Joule awakens on New Eden to find nothing is as it should be.
  Negative
Where she should have been one of many early inhabitants getting the barren planet prepared for the last survivors of an apocalyptic plague back on Earth, instead, shes the only human around, surrounded by hostile mechanical monsters called Corebots.
  Negative
As Joule tries to figure out exactly whats happened on New Eden, shell rely on her own companion Corebot, Mack  and other friendly bots she finds along the way  to figure out what happened, and how to hopefully fix it all before its too late.
  Negative
While Recore is in some ways item-gated, locking progress behind traveral or geographic obstacles that can only be overcome with certain gear or abilities, few of these upgrades apply to Joule.
  Negative
Instead, her robot friends fulfill that role, in addition to providing some valuable combat support.
  Negative
For example, Seth  yes, all of the friendly robots have person names  is a spider bot who can scramble along special tracks, dragging Joule along for the ride, whereas the huge bipedal Duncan can knock things over or smash through certain barriers.
  Negative
Joule, meanwhile, will be doing a lot of shooting.
  Negative
Recores combat is dictated by a color system.
  Positive
Each color has a different property: Red does flame damage, yellow slows things down or holds them in place, and blue is an electrical attack.
  Negative
Enemies take extra damage from attacks that match their own color, your success will largely depend on matching colors quickly in the heat of battle, especially as the game progresses and throws multiple colors at you at once.
  Negative
Additional complexity comes from the "core" mechanic.
  Positive
Each bot has a core at their center, and when their health gets low enough, Joule can throw out her hook to try to pull it out.
  Positive
This results in a mini-game where you have to pull back on the right stick enough to get the core out without snapping the connection.
  Negative
As Joule does more and more damage in combat encounters, youll build a combo meter and do more damage with your attacks, and youll also earn the ability to instantly steal a bots core  no minigame required  destroying it and causing an explosion that will incapacitate and damage other enemies.
  Negative
Doing so ends the combo.
  Neutral
This is one of the places where Recore shines.
  Positive
When combat got frantic and I was chaining charged shots, power attacks from my bots and timing instant core snatches from the most powerful enemies, Recore channels early s Japanese action games in a way that feels hard to resist.
  Negative
Its colorful and fast and remarkably fluid, and it feels like instinctive, constant decision-making without getting too bogged down in weapon types.
  Negative
Recore mixes up these combat scenarios with extended traversal challenges.
  Neutral
Double jumps and a dash move add up to more than it might seem at face value.
  Negative
Where other games often fail spectacularly in their attempts to pull off third-person platforming gameplay, Recores gives you an immense amount of fine control over Joule while shes in the air.
  Positive
The ability to make adjustments at the last possible second makes getting around less frustrating than many other games, and it also makes success feel like an accomplishment.
  Positive
This is especially true later in the game during some frantic sections involving disappearing platforms and rotating lasers.
  Neutral
Recores biggest problem is how little of everything there seems to be, and how in denial the game seems to be about it.
  Negative
Actual levels in Recore are few  theres only a handful of story missions, several of which are extremely brief, along with another handful of optional "dungeons" scattered throughout the world.
  Negative
It adds up to a game that feels very thin, and it also feels like Armature and Comcept knew it.
  Very negative
The overworld stretches things out and navigating it is often painfully slow.
  Negative
But this is only the beginning of mechanics and systems that feel designed to make the game longer than it can justify.
  Negative
For example, you can only have two bot partners active at once, which makes no sense at all.
  Negative
This "crew switching" forces constant trips back to waypoints to get the right bot for the job, and if you need to switch cores into a different body, youve got to head back to the home base.
  Negative
Its an enormous amount of wasted time, and its disruptive to the Recores momentum every time it happens.
  Negative
Theres also a loot and crafting system of sorts, though the practical applications felt minimal in my  hours with the game.
  Negative
The implementation also feels somewhat contradictory.
  Negative
Snatching cores from enemies, which is presented as if its the sort of ideal, game-defining way of defeating them, rewards you with colored energy which can be used to upgrade the stats of your robot friends.
  Very positive
But this yields no crafting components.
  Negative
Meanwhile, destroying an enemy outright gives less energy but does provide crafting components.
  Negative
Its a bizarre, counterproductive dichotomy that doesnt add anything to Recore other than frustration.
  Negative
Recore is also terrible at incentivizing exploration given how much tedious beach-combing the game demands in order to complete its story.
  Negative
The game nudged and shoved me toward its last area, actively discouraging me from wandering through some sections of New Eden by virtue of unkillable high-level enemies with skulls on their health bars.
  Negative
Then after defeating a boss, Recore sent me packing back to the wasteland to grind out more prismatic cores, a collectible item required to unlock dungeons.
  Negative
This was around six or seven hours into the game, which had already seen some grinding of stages and trips back and forth to Joules Crawler, but that wasnt enough.
  Negative
I had to go back and scour the wasteland of New Eden for another six hours or so to cobble together enough cores to finish the game.
  Negative
This was annoying but not awful at first, as I had finally leveled enough to adventure into the few places where I hadnt been able to on my first pass, but after a few hours of cleanup, things got more desperate.
  Very negative
In the end, I was replaying dungeons to scrape up cores I might have missed, and spent hours searching for energy cores in the desert to unlock the gates to the final few dungeons.
  Negative
The shooting that had been fun for the first half became a real chore as I hit the same respawning mobs as I trudged back and forth.
  Negative
This was made even more grueling by Recores abysmal in-game waypoint system, by which I mean there isnt one.
  Negative
Occasionally the game will throw up a green diamond to show you the next location you should head toward, but this is pretty rare.
  Positive
Worse, Recores fast travel system is extremely limited, traversing the overworld is extremely slow and monotonous, and theres no option to mark your own waypoints or active objectives in the game.
  Negative
I swapped back to the in-game map in the menu literally hundreds of times.
  Negative
It turns Recore into an anticlimactic scavenger hunt with the worlds worst GPS.
  Negative
To cap it off, Recore ends with a lightning fast resolution it doesnt earn, and drops an infuriating tease for a sequel, which feels particularly egregious in a game with so many narrative gaps.
  Negative
Recore isnt a disaster, as much as the bizarre structure and hoops it made me jump through left a bad taste in my mouth.
  Very negative
At its heart, theres a game with some good ideas and great spins on action-game conceits that dont see a lot of play this console generation.
  Positive
When its working, Recore is a game that feels evocative of a different era of action games.
  Positive
But in its final half, Comcept and Armature let collect-a-thon structure and a poorly realized open world drag the whole thing back down to earth.
  Negative
