When Vancouver-based developer The Coalition formerly Black Tusk Studios was entrusted with the Gears of War franchise in , the team decided that the best way to learn Gears would be to revisit original developer Epic's work on the game that started the series.
  Negative
The result is Gears of War: Ultimate Edition.
  Neutral
Ultimate offers a completely intact, gameplay-identical version of Gears' campaign, albeit one with a complete visual overhaul, and a revamped vision of the original game's multiplayer mode with tweaks both big and small, the most drastic being a locked  fps frame rate.
  Neutral
The result is a conflicted, but accurate statement: Gears of War is both better and worse than you remember.
  Negative
Thankfully, it's much more the former than the latter.
  Positive
Originally released in , Gears of War popularized a then-new kind of action game, taking the over the shoulder camera of Resident Evil  and a cover mechanic inspired by the  game Kill Switch, mixing it into something unique.
  Positive
In a period full of first person shooters borrowing from the likes of Halo and a pre-modern-day Call of Duty, Gears of War went for something more intimate, and more brutal, all from third person.
  Negative
If you haven't played Gears of War, I'll be succinct: It remains a very good shooter, one better than many modern releases that had the benefit to come out after a console generation's worth of lessons and mistakes.
  Positive
Gears' shooting remains distinctive, and remarkably so, given its success.
  Positive
Bodies take a enormous amount of punishment, and battles aren't about quick, surgical shots.
  Negative
Gun battles feel more like fist fights, where you're beating the crap out of things with bullets, where any distance more than a few feet feels like it might be too far away.
  Very negative
It helps that the chainsaw-equipped Lancer rifle remains one of the most viscerally satisfying melee tools I've ever used in a game, and that the Gnasher shotgun still feels like a flak cannon.
  Positive
Mechanics like active reload underline a successful effort to layer optional sophistication and skill-based gameplay between taking down enemies in Gears of War.
  Negative
It still works, and speaks to how well the series has always managed downtime and combat without ruining its sense of pacing.
  Positive
Gears of War knows where to breathe, and how to ratchet up the tension.
  Neutral
It manages this in ways that feel almost quaint now, but the slow introduction of new weapons and new enemy types that are then woven into the game's various encounters works just as well now as it did then.
  Positive
Those encounters form the backbone of Gears of War, and remain its strongest aspect.
  Positive
Through a campaign whose length looks almost elephantine in comparison to modern shooters, Epic successfully iterated on the basic cover-based concept and made fights that even nine years later I still remember playing through the first time  like Embry Square, or the first appearance of the terrifying Theron Guard.
  Negative
For a team that had done little in the way of ambitious single-player experiences, Epic built a game that still sits confidently atop the superlatives it received nine years ago.
  Negative
usually.
  Neutral
But Gears' levels feel designed for tactical consideration with a partner, with places to flank and achieve superior positioning and overwatch, and its limited boss encounters beg for two-pronged approaches and controlling fields of fire.
  Positive
That said, nine years is a long time, a practical epoch in game development terms, and that shows in various ways.
  Negative
From a level design perspective, the sections where Gears of War intentionally splits you and your partner up mark some of the more egregiously punishing tendencies of the game, especially on higher difficulties.
  Negative
Speaking to difficulty, the later Gears of War games found a sweet spot between "egregiously punishing" and a strong but mostly fair sense of challenge.
  Negative
The original game, and thus Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, doesn't navigate this quite as well.
  Negative
The Coalition has retooled the casual difficulty in the original release, adding a normal setting and making casual much less intimidating.
  Negative
Most players will find a decent challenge on normal.
  Neutral
I prefer the second-highest difficulty, hardcore, which generally provides a good sense of back-and-forth in firefights, where I feel like I have to work for kills and earn progress.
  Negative
But Hardcore difficulty in Gears of War features plenty of moments  too many, honestly  where cheap, one-shot kills come from out of nowhere, particularly against enemies with explosive weapons.
  Negative
Companion AI in Gears of War can be equally murderous.
  Negative
I had "friendly" AI jump in front of my Boomshot fire just as I pulled the trigger more than once, leading to a quick, splattery death.
  Negative
I also felt blocked in often enough to be enraging, and there's no good way to push an AI teammate out of the way of a door.
  Negative
Later in the game, when cover is deliberately more sparse, I was hit by surgical Torque Bow shots from Theron Guard as my AI companion sat against the only chest-high wall available.
  Negative
In hindsight it's also easier to see places where Gears of War received less care or passes than other sections.
  Neutral
Act two feels somewhat disjointed and features one of the most reviled sections of the game involving a car, a light and shadow-hungry monsters that flock like birds.
  Negative
It's less of a hassle than I remembered, but it's still not fun.
  Negative
Gears of War stumbles the most in these moments when it gets farthest away from its exceptionally tight core gameplay loop.
  Negative
Other flaws feel like a casualty to a less-developed understanding of presentation and game design in .
  Negative
Checkpoints are frequently too far apart, and often take place before an in-game bit of cutscene storytelling, though, thankfully, these can almost always be immediately skipped.
  Negative
Broadly speaking, cutscenes are often bookended by black screens or even full level loads, something more experience developers have gotten much better about in the intervening decade.
  Negative
The latter presentation kinks are only so noticeable set against the complete visual overhaul Gears of War: Ultimate Edition brings to the table.
  Negative
The Coalition has banged the drum of zero original assets from  as a marketing point since the game was announced, but it's not all talk: Gears Ultimate looks like a modern game, and a very pretty one at that.
  Positive
As importantly, every cutscene in the game has been completely reshot using modern tools, often with cuts and minor additions for pacing and clarity.
  Negative
The story isn't different, but it does feel slightly more intelligible, and easier to follow.
  Negative
Gears of War: Ultimate Edition's campaign also benefits from a subtle but significant improvement in controls.
  Positive
It doesn't change the basic gameplay in campaign, but everything feels smoother, in part because the original release's performance could veer so wildly away from its  fps target.
  Negative
But this improvement is even more pronounced in Gears of War: Ultimate Edition's multiplayer component, where The Coalition has bumped the frame rate up to  fps.
  Negative
Gears of War has never controlled poorly, exactly, but it's always been a heavy game where positioning and strategy matter more than twitch target acquisition.
  Negative
With the Ultimate release, it's now one of the smoothest-controlling shooters I've ever played.
  Negative
It also makes certain timing based weapons, like the Longshot sniper rifle and Torque Bow just easier much easier to use, in my experience.
  Negative
The Coalition has held the multiplayer experience less sacrosanct than the campaign, choosing to make minor inclusions like eight-way rolling  the original game only allowed for forward, back, left and right  and some traversal elements that appeared in later games.
  Negative
In this way, Gears of War: Ultimate Edition's multiplayer feels more aware of modern multiplayer expectations than its single-player element.
  Negative
This includes dedicated servers for all modes, a decent if somewhat limited set of spectator options, minor tweaks to some maps to ensure symmetric level layouts  and an even competitive playfield  and various nods to the hardcore competitive contingent of Gears of War fans, like a special mode and support for LAN play, the first Xbox One game to do so.
  Very negative
Gears of War: Ultimate Edition is, largely, the same multiplayer game with the same philosophies as its original release, which makes it my least favorite of the main trilogy.
  Negative
I've always preferred the Lancer to the Gnasher, and felt like the shotgun's prevalence in multiplayer spoke counter to the more unique elements of the series.
  Negative
That describes Ultimate Edition just as well.
  Positive
But that decision doesn't feel like a remnant or an old mistake.
  Negative
It feels like an intentional inclusion.
  Negative
The result is something that doesn't feel new, exactly, but it does feel surprisingly relevant.
  Positive
Gears of War's campaign has some small particulars that could derail a worse game, and its flaws are more clear now than they were nine years ago.
  Very negative
But Gears of War's bona fides as a shooter classic feel less in dispute than ever  and Gears of War: Ultimate Edition is easily the best way to understand why that is.
  Negative
here.
  Neutral
