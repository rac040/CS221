This twining of characters is played out in an elementary story about independence and growth.
  Negative

  Negative
Despite the story's prognostications, this is a world of bright abstractions.
  Positive
Ro and her daughter communicate through expression only, via hugs and hand-holding.

Monument Valley  successfully replicates the original's charm and vibrancy.
