As kitschy as the name "Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime" might seem, every word in that title is completely accurate.
  Positive
It's a game about love; about a galaxy fueled by affection, and a game design that tests the relationship and teamwork of its two co-op players.
  Positive
It takes place in outer space, albeit an infinitely colorful and vibrant version of outer space, inhabited by adorable, bipedal animals.
  Very positive
However, the most apt word in that title  by a country mile  is "dangerous.
  Neutral
"Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime is a stress-handling simulator, one that delights in tossing you into the deep end of the pool after you've just escaped the deep end of a different, adjacent pool.
  Positive
That may sound like a turn-off, but sharing in that constant scrambling with a friend is uniquely rewarding, assuming you both don't drown.
  Positive
You and your co-pilot  who can also be an AI pet that you can command  are tasked with flying a circular spaceship lined with different terminals through asteroid belts, space stations and other tight-quarters environments on a rescue mission.
  Negative
Each terminal serves a different function: Your basic ship has turrets in all four cardinal directions, a station that lets you rotate a projectile-blocking shield around your ship, a "super weapon" on a long recharge, a pilot's chair and, most amusingly, a map terminal you have to use periodically to get your bearings.
  Very negative
Each station can be upgraded by collecting gems found floating around in the inky blackness of space, which can further be combined to develop unique power-ups.
  Negative
By the end of each campaign chapter, your standard ship will have transformed into a power-thrusting, caltrop-dropping, chainsaw-wielding, rocket-launching, projectile-reflecting death machine.
  Negative
After completing that same chapter, you lose it all.
  Negative
C'est la vie.
  Negative
The joy of Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime is knowing which two stations any given situation calls for.
  Negative
If you're scouting for rescue targets  each level has , though you only need to locate five to move on to the next level  one player flies while the other bounces between the map and whichever gun is facing forward.
  Negative
Learning which fights require the use of the shield and which require the well-timed deployment of a super weapon takes nearly the whole game, but making the right judgment call is hugely satisfying.
  Positive
You actually have to run and jump around the interior of your ship to go to those different stations, so plotting your course and your teammate's course becomes half the challenge.
  Negative
It's not easy to hop off a cannon and dive into the shield station to try to make a last-minute save, or to deploy the super weapon and pilot it into the path of an incoming enemy.
  Negative
The game is constantly pushing you ever so slightly out of your comfort zone, which is almost always an exhilarating place to be.
  Very positive
Sometimes, though, Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime ramps up the difficulty too far, too fast.
  Negative
On the game's "Normal" difficulty, you'll occasionally be beset upon by waves of enemies spawning in on all sides, launching more projectiles at you than you could ever dodge or block, all knocking you into damaging terrain or into the path of an awaiting sentry gun.
  Negative
I've gone from full health to exploded in a matter of seconds, losing a -minute run before I knew what hit me.
  Negative
It's enough to sap your desire to hit the Retry button, and probably enough to send you into the loving embrace of the still-kind-of-difficult "Casual" difficulty setting.
  Negative
Difficulty spikes notwithstanding, Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime is otherwise respectful of its players' time.
  Negative
You can knock out the campaign in a little over five hours, but no two levels are alike  you'll ricochet between hectic timed rescue missions, underwater current surfing missions, wave-based survival missions and some genuinely clever, thrilling boss battles, with little repetition between them.
  Negative
It was enough to keep me constantly guessing, and frequently crashing.
  Positive
Every facet of Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime's design is built around coordination, especially once you unlock more complex ships that tamper with the core rules of the game.
  Negative
For example, the "Banana Split" vessel has color-coded security doors that only certain players can pass through  flying that ship involves a lot of yelling across the couch.
  Negative
However, I'm torn on whether or not it's easier to play with an AI partner, represented by a space helmet-equipped cat or dog.
  Neutral
You can direct them to scamper to and control any station on your ship, except for the pilot's seat.
  Negative
They can move lightning-fast, and there's no confusion on where both pilots are at any given time, but your AI teammate is incapable of the kind of triage a human player brings to the table.
  Negative
I can't count the number of times my dumb cat has rotated our shield to block a single incoming projectile, moving that shield out of the way of the  incoming projectiles on the opposite side.
  Negative
Bad, cat.
  Negative
Bad.
  Negative
Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime can occasionally feel a little too stressful for its own good, but there's something undeniably lovely about its core design.
  Positive
It is, ultimately, an object lesson in dealing with hardships  that even when they grow to be far too much to handle, they can be softened with the support of a patient and cooperative friend.
  Negative
Or, if you can't find a patient and cooperative friend, you can always just get a cat.
  Neutral
here.
