Umbrella Corps is the last gasp of a disastrous era in Resident Evil history.
  Negative
At least I hope it is.
  Positive
There was once a time when every Resident Evil release was trumpeted as a BIG DEAL.
  Negative
The games would be announced years in advance and fans would pore over every trailer like it was the Zapruder film.
  Neutral
But starting with Resident Evil , the franchise began to take a turn.
  Positive
Rather than the slow, scary games of yore, Resident Evil became all about firepower and body counts.
  Negative
The games got faster and more action-heavy, with maligned releases like Resident Evil  and Operation Raccoon City bringing the once-untouchable franchise to its knees.
  Positive
Umbrella Corps is yet another step in that direction and hopefully the last well see in a while.
  Positive
Umbrella Corps is a multiplayer shooter, placing you in the role of a mercenary seeking to profit off of the remains of the star-crossed Umbrella Corporation.
  Negative
Youre sent in with two other identical-looking soldiers to battle it out against three other identical-looking soldiers in a variety of locales set across the franchises storied past.
  Negative
Backstory is pretty minimal here, save for some text crawls giving fanservice nods to important dates and viruses.
  Negative
Its really just an excuse for these v matches to take place in the village from Resident Evil  or the remnants of an Umbrella lab.
  Negative
If youre looking for additional insight into Wesker and the gang, youve come to the wrong place.
  Negative
The same can be said if youre looking for an enjoyable multiplayer experience.
  Neutral
The games default mode is a simple deathmatch with no respawns.
  Negative
Theoretically this would lead to tactical movement and planning, but players in Umbrella Corps move and die so quickly that these multiplayer matches end in less than a minute or two, booting you back to the lobby screen with the hope that someone will join and fill the required six slots.
  Negative
Cover-based mechanics imply that the developers at Capcom expected longer, more drawn-out fights, but the game they designed simply doesnt allow for them.
  Negative
The only other multiplayer mode in Umbrella Corps is called Multi-Mission, and it encompasses a variety of simple multiplayer staples in a single match.
  Negative
One round might be straight deathmatch, while another has players trying to kill marked VIPs.
  Negative
Mercifully these rounds are longer, with respawns, so at least you can get some momentum going, but they dont feel remarkable in the least.
  Positive
If youve played a multiplayer shooter in the last five years, every familiar mode is represented.
  Negative
The minute-to-minute gameplay is equally dull and often frustrating.
  Negative
Umbrella Corps plays from a third person perspective but it gives you no real vision of your surroundings outside a very narrow cone in front of you.
  Negative
Its as if the camera is glued to the soldiers ear, and that lack of vision often results in unheralded death.
  Negative
Meanwhile, the guns feel puny and the controls feel like youre walking on ice skates.
  Negative
Its abysmal.
  Neutral
The one mechanic that does attempt to set Umbrella Corps apart is its inclusion of zombies in multiplayer.
  Negative
Undead creatures are scattered about multiplayer maps.
  Negative
They will ignore you so long as you dont antagonize them.
  Negative
But if youre shot by another player in the head or neck assuming you dont die, your zombie distraction system will malfunction and suddenly youll become a target for any brain-eaters in the vicinity.
  Negative
Its an interesting mechanic that probably belongs in a better game.
  Positive
The drab, frustrating action of Umbrella Corps means that this adds to the number of things that can potentially kill you while your cumbersome head is turned the other way.
  Negative
These zombies are also prevalent in the games "single-player campaign," which is a generous way to describe the mode provided.
  Negative
Set across the games multiplayer maps, youre tasked with collecting DNA from dead zombies, over and over again, until you play enough levels to unlock a new, dull objective to complete across a different multiplayer map.
  Negative
Its torturously boring and shouldnt be experienced by anyone except the poor QA testers who were paid to do so.
  Negative
here.
