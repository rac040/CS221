There are far worse things to do with an afternoon than spending it on Dragon Quest Heroes II.
  Negative
For instance, playing a game that doesnt let you fight with warfans.
  Neutral
Much like its predecessor, Dragon Quest Heroes II blends the popular RPG series with the high-energy slash-em-up action play of Dynasty Warriors and its ilk.
  Negative
Large battlefield confrontations between opposing generals in so-called War Zones are broken up by more mundane gathering quests, excursions through Wild Zone fields and forests, and lots of loot.
  Negative
Divided as it is between these two styles of game, Dragon Quest Heroes II manages to be adequate at both  and excels at neither.
  Positive
Players assume the role of either Lazarel or Teresa, a pair of cousins living in a peaceful kingdom before they find themselves swept up in a growing conflict.
  Negative
While most of the other characters who show up to join the heros party have set jobs and weapons, Lazarel and Teresa are chameleons.
  Negative
They can assume any vocation  and the sooner that change is made the better.
  Negative
Thats because the key to having a good time with Dragon Quest Heroes II or Warriors games in general is finding the perfect weapon.
  Positive
Warriors games are well known for the bevy of weapons on offer, ranging from common ones like swords and axes to the more uncommon finds like whips and cards, each with a wildly different style.
  Neutral
This was what drew me to the series in the first place I will play literally anything that gives me warfans as a weapon option, and Dragon Quest Heroes IIs armory is every bit as expansive.
  Negative
Consequently, finding the weapons that suit your style best is every bit as important as picking a balanced party or suiting up with the best gear.
  Positive
Each vocation levels up separately, but with the help of experience boosts, solomultiplayer dungeons and optional bosses its not too tedious to catch up.
  Negative
Careful scheduling can also be a big help, as different in-game bonuses are available depending on the day of the week.
  Positive
Thursdays are the best days to find rare ingredients used to upgrade your gear for instance, while other days affect experience rates, enemy types, gold earnings and so on.
  Negative
As was the case in the first game, the crux of combat remains each characters tension meter.
  Negative
Every hit landed in battle builds this meter up, and once its full they can launch into an invincible state, deliver a few cost-free hits while the meter runs down, and then cap it off with an extremely powerful coup-de-grace finisher.
  Neutral
Adding even more variety to the combat, defeated monsters occasionally drop medals that can be used to summon them in battle.
  Negative
Some monsters fight alongside the player, others pop as a one-shot ability, while still other coins let the player character assume the monsters form and fight with their unique skills for a short time.
  Negative
The similarities continue.
  Neutral
Accessory upgrades can be still crafted, side quests undertaken to earn rewards and unlock special perks.
  Positive
Even the UI is very similar, with the exception of a serious downgrade to the skill window.
  Negative
While the old one was partitioned tidily, the new version is a mess of nodes that required a lot of sifting every time I popped in to spend a few points on any of the dozen characters available.
  Negative
Broadly, Dragon Quest Heroes II vacillates between making me appreciate the old and starving me for something fresh.
  Negative
The franchises devotion to nostalgia is especially evident in a soundtrack that anyone who has ever brushed against the franchise will recognize  and Im not going to pretend I found it as endearing as I did even  months ago when I was neck-deep in Dragon Quest Builders.
  Negative
Those midi-ish tones and chimes worked well for me in the context of a cutesy sandbox adventure, but their use in Dragon Quest Heroes II left me longing for a further evolution or rearrangement to make them fit the games presentation just a little better.
  Neutral
A little bit of nostalgia can be charming, and sometimes Dragon Quest Heroes II gets that right.
  Positive
The reappearance of familiar characters, the use of some old-school sound effects, metal and liquid metal slimes whizzing around begging to be smooshed  there are countless callbacks and hat-tips that do just enough to spark a fans fondness without putting off a relative newbie.
  Negative
In general there are a lot of thoughtful touches in this game worth appreciating, like the random names assigned to summoned monsters a mummy named Chris Swaddle was easily my favorite and the light dusting of snow that appears when characters are roaming the icy mountains.
  Negative
There are a lot of areas like this where Dragon Quest Heroes II succeeds me, little things to praise like the attack effects, the weapon designs, the voice acting  heck, they have a child-voiced character who inserts the word "goo" into every sentence and it never once grated on me.
  Very negative
But even with those little successes, I couldnt muster much enthusiasm for Dragon Quest Heroes II.
  Negative
It spends a great deal of time up front establishing the worlds big, open Wild Zones, but gives them a bare minimum amount of personality compared to the battlefields and puzzle maps that comprise its War Zones.
  Neutral
Beyond making players run through them to unlock the next War Zone, these in-between spaces are only ever justified with a series of irritating wild goose chases and McGuffin hunts toward the end of the game.
  Negative
Most of the time theyre simply spaces to teleport across or grind in a game where grinding is seldom necessary.
  Negative
I also quickly lost my patience with the way enemies behave.
  Negative
Most move slowly and dont get aggressive and follow as predictably as Id like, meaning that its all but impossible to gather a truly massive group together and mow them down a deeply satisfying part of playing Dynasty Warriors.
  Negative
Bosses also have a nasty habit of honing in player-controlled character over anyone else.
  Negative
Even while swapping from one character to the next in my party and using items to encourage the likelihood of one character being targeted over others their attention simply followed me, which limits the strategies available for tougher fights and also just feels a bit cheap.
  Negative
I had to be slower, more thoughtful, more patient as a result, and thats honestly not what I come to this kind of game for.
  Positive
What I like about Warriors games is the noise.
  Positive
Not just sound, but visual noise, tactile noise.
  Negative
Numbers all over the screen, swarms of enemies animating in unison as they all take the same blow, thumbs jamming on buttons, crashes and clatters, sweeps of light and color, whirling fans and magic and nonsense.
  Negative
But its noise in a tidy and predictable way that keeps it from being overwhelming, noise that Im conducting, with all my square-square-triangle presses keeping the tempo.
  Negative
Dragon Quest Heroes II never quite nailed that feeling for me.
  Negative
Even the moments it came closest were diluted with errand-like story quests and obstinate A.I.
Dragon Quest Heroes II is exactly the kind of game that, one year from now, I wont even remember playing.
  Negative
Its entertaining enough, but in spite of that it never quite finds its stride.
  Negative
Each of its highest moments come with the knowledge of what the game is grasping towards but cant quite reach, both as an RPG and as a Warriors game.
  Positive
But at least it let me use warfans.
  Negative
