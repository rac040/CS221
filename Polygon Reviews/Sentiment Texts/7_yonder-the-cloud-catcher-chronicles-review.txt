Yonder: The Cloud Catcher Chronicles takes cues from a variety of literature and games  then fulfills promises some of those inspirations couldnt keep.
  Negative
In , Peter Molyneux promised that in Fable, you could plant an acorn, and later in your characters life, that acorn would grow into a tree.
  Negative
Famously, that did not happen, nor did it happen in Fable II, some seven years later.
  Negative
Enter Yonder, which while not produced by Peter Molyneux, does in fact let you plant an acorn, only to come back in due time to find a fully sprouted tree.
  Negative
Fable is only one inspiration for Yonder, a game with a small fleet of influences.
  Negative
Its immediately recalling Zelda insofar as following the third-person adventure of a lost young child discovering their hidden past.
  Negative
Harvest Moon comes into play  Yonders minimalist farming recalls the Natsume-published series.
  Negative
Theres a hint of Animal Crossing too.
  Neutral
Interactions with villagers often skew comedic, but never with snark.
  Negative
Yonder comes from Australian studio Prideful Sloth games.
  Neutral
For the developer of Yonder, theres no better name to represent their output.
  Positive
Yonder wont pressure anyone when wandering the landscapes of Gemea.
  Negative
Without leveling, without health, without time restrictions, everything you do is free of confinement.
  Negative
Yonder is, plainly, a game of almost nothing where you need do nothing.
  Negative
In the opening scene, a boat crashes ashore the lost island of Gemea during a storm, probing Arthur Conan Doyle or Jules Vernes turn-of-the-century novels.
  Negative
But Yonder departs from so many of its gaming contemporaries in its expressed bent towards pacifism.
  Neutral
There are no monsters to fight, nothing to kill.
  Negative
The closest thing to combat is splintering wooden crates or knocking on boulders with a hammer.
  Negative
With gentle orchestration moving the slim storybook-like tale forward, Yonders innocence is undeniable.
  Positive
With no game over screen or death state, Prideful Sloth instead allows you the autonomy to explore and discover.
  Negative
While Gamea is hardly a realm flush with surprise, seeing the sights, mingling with animals even befriending them with food, and helping rather than harming this aesthetically delightful world feels right.
  Neutral
Planting seeds to grow trees - eventually a game-wide quest - also makes wildlife easier to befriend  and, hopefully, make them part of your farm.
  Positive
Tend to your farm animals and their milk is then available to trade for items.
  Negative
To be free from frustration with Yonders mellowed pacing is a unique gift.
  Neutral
Without the tangles of leveling, almost nothing in Yonder ties into anything else; the different elements of story, farming, and random adventuring exist as separate elements.
  Very negative
You can gleefully explore without farming, or farm without touching the story although completing a handful of specific missions does create the opportunity for constructing new building types.
  Neutral
An ambient antagonist, Murk, is an identity-less, purplish dark aura, covering specific locations on the island.
  Negative
It never speaks or harms anything, which for Yonder is a tonally appropriate villain.
  Negative
Knocking it back requires Yonders fully customizable and nameless protagonist to find fairy-like Sprites.
  Negative
Find enough and the Murk is chased away, uncovering new areas or secrets.
  Negative
Sprites are hidden about, speaking in pun-based dialogs equivalent to the worst dad jokes when discovered.
  Negative
Otherwise, they show no personality.
  Negative
In the menu, its possible to select a single Sprite to join you, yet this decision changes nothing.
  Negative
The same goes for Yonders silent protagonist.
  Neutral
All of the dialog is one-sided, a trope that handicaps any sense of character.
  Negative
Even as you arrive and in spite of the Murk blocking some of their land, as a society, Gemea evolved into a care-free Eden.
  Negative
Glancing around after the crash, it doesnt appear to need saving.
  Negative
Without taking on any tasks, bouncy wildlife already spreads across gorgeous island greenery, zero conflict has emerged between the various towns, and economies were built on friendly bartering rather than currency.
  Negative
Everyone works toward total restoration of their land, together.
  Very negative
Even when dealing with potential destruction of their world, the population of Gemea is affable, charming, and caring.
  Positive
This existence isnt particularly exciting, though.
  Positive
Speaking to villagers, their tasks amount to go here, find this and bring it back, usually with the necessary quantity of it in hand.
  Positive
Its the worst of open world busywork, spread out over five hours or more depending on your personal completionist tendencies stretch this to ten hours to get everything.
  Very negative
Thankfully, some hide their fetch quests well within amusing setups.
  Negative
In one side mission, a woman wished to enter a beard competition, requiring an odd recipe with goofy requirements.
  Negative
Chasing the pieces down offers enough humor to offset the fetch-quest nature of the task in question, if only a little.
  Negative
Oddly then, completing the story and helping these people is a downer.
  Negative
For as bright, chipper, and harmless as Yonder seems, the final moments spin a fairy tale that says its not okay to be who you are.
  Positive
Discovering your family history and why Gemea became infected by Murk feels more like a casualty of identity.
  Negative
Considering the gender-neutral creation options and overarching theme of being anyone, the final uneventful text crawl is crushing instead of inspiring.
  Negative
In the end, Yonder isnt inventive, exactly, as the multitude of ideas and cross-media inspirations converge somehow into something infinitely familiar.
  Positive
Missions are cut down to absolute basics to fulfill an open world quota, but its possible to forgive this when traipsing through this aesthetically pleasing land and helping these delighted folk.
  Negative
And as importantly, theres bravery in eliminating things like combat and leveling, allowing Yonder a rare, distinctive brevity.
  Negative
