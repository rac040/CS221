Given its long list of influences, it would have been easy for Gigantic to feel like an also-ran  a repeat of a game weve played a thousand times over.
  Negative
Instead, developer Motiga has pulled off a clever balancing act.
  Negative
Gigantic combines well-worn genres to make an experience that feels new, but familiar.
  Negative
Rather than settling for an objective-based team shooter or a MOBA full of colorful characters, Gigantic mashes together the best parts of both genres into a unique package.
  Positive
You might feel like youve seen it all before, but this combination still offers something special, a mix of mechanics that feels dynamic rather than stale.
  Negative
Each match in Gigantic follows the same formula: Players must defend and empower their guardian, a massive beast that sits at each teams base.
  Negative
You gather power for this guardian by killing enemies, summoning beasts and controlling points across the map.
  Negative
Once youve pooled enough power, the guardian can attack the enemy teams monster in a massive, screen-filling fight.
  Negative
This is your opportunity to hustle to the opposite end of the map to attack the downed guardian before it struggles free.
  Negative
If you cause enough damage, you inflict a wound on the enemys guardian.
  Negative
Three of those and you win.
  Positive
Gigantic requires more of its players  more strategy and more steps to victory  than you might be used to from the average team shooter or MOBA, but the game knows that.
  Negative
A tutorial walks you through each phase of the games mechanics  from summoning beasts to attacking and defending the guardian  until its sure youve got the gist.
  Neutral
By the time I had run through the mandatory tutorial and bot matches, the games flow felt more natural than it sounds in description.
  Positive
Moreso than with the the structure of each match, my expectations were challenged when I looked through the games roster.
  Negative
Gigantic launches with  heroes, all of whom are colorful and bursting with so much character, you can imagine them headlining their own animated film.
  Positive
While it may be initially clear what character archetypes each hero falls into, further examination proves theres more than meets the eye.
  Positive
All of Gigantics combatants are a blend of ideas that break the mold one way or another.
  Positive
Take for instance, Zandora, a galactic, sword-wielding woman.
  Neutral
On the surface, you might imagine shes a melee bruiser whose sword can cut down enemies.
  Negative
You would be half right, but shes also one of the games few support characters; in addition to slicing and dicing, she can cast buffs on herself and her team.
  Negative
Understanding that Zandora will likely find herself in the middle of most team fights, the developers created a hero who feels equal parts tank and essential utility character.
  Negative
Design choices like this solve a few problems at once.
  Negative
For one, MOBA players who might not be great with their aim can play a melee character who is more than just left click to win.
  Negative
Sure, Zandora is strong, but shes also highly strategic.
  Positive
Knowing when to cast her buffs is essential for winning fights and keeping your team alive.
  Positive
On the other hand, she gives shooter fans an interesting introduction to melee combat that will feel different than what youd expect.
  Positive
Other melee characters have multidimensional gameplay baked into their kits.
  Negative
Wu feels like they dropped a fighting game character into Gigantic; Aisling is a young swordswoman that can summon a melee companion to fight with her; and Tyto and Tripp are traditional glass cannon characters who are fast and strong, but can fall quickly in battle if they get overzealous.
  Very positive
The ranged characters are also more nuanced than simple point and shoot heroes.
  Negative
Beckett is an adventurer who carries two guns, and she can feel like a completely different character depending on which weapon you choose to wield.
  Negative
Xenobia is a demon that harasses the battlefield and sucks life from her enemies.
  Positive
Charnoks fire-based attacks bombard the battlefield and let him control the space around him.
  Negative
Even more traditional characters like the sniper Imani or the battle robot HK- have a few twists that set apart their otherwise predictable loadouts.
  Negative
Gigantic takes character diversity a step further by allowing you to modify your hero as they level up.
  Positive
Individual skills or character traits can be changed, giving some attacks news elements or even changing a character altogether.
  Negative
For instance you can give the aforementioned Zandora an upgrade that allows her to shoot lasers from her sword, effectively turning her from a melee to a ranged character.
  Negative
This flexibility makes certain characters feel totally different depending on the situation.
  Negative
Instead of having a fixed kit of skills, players can modify their heroes on the fly to meet the demands of any given match.
  Negative
This idea is hardly new in the space of MOBAs, but considering the flow of Gigantics combat and how often it changes, my choices felt even more situational.
  Negative
I never found myself sticking to the same optimized character builds in every match.
  Negative
And while I spent a lot of time figuring out how to best compete against certain situations or team compositions, the games progression system makes all that experience worthwhile.
  Positive
Since Gigantic is free-to-play, not everything is opened up for use to start; youll need to work through matches and grind out currency to eventually unlock the entire games cast, as well as some of their skins or summoned creatures.
  Negative
This system offers up the standard in-game currency which you earn by playing and special currency you can buy with real-world money.
  Neutral
Like many free-to-play games, characters and other valuable unlockables can be bought straight out instead of earning enough in-game currency to get them.
  Negative
The games most desirable cosmetics skins are only available by spending actual money.
  Negative
While Gigantic rotates who you have access to periodically, the game never struck me as entirely withholding as I grinded to earn currency to buy the characters I wanted most.
  Negative
The training mode is helpful for test driving any character youd like by allowing you to fight various types of monsters at will and letting you choose every upgrade at the start.
  Negative
This is great for players eager to figure out where to spend their hard-earned currency since they can test every hero out and experiment with all their upgrades.
  Positive
For the purposes of this review, I purchased the Gigantic Founders Pack for , which was renamed the Ultimate Pack on launch and gives you access to all current and future characters  but I only picked that up halfway through my time with the game, and I still enjoyed myself, even before I had access to the full roster.
  Positive
The character diversity is strong enough that the grind for currency was still enjoyable.
  Positive
Gigantic also employs several tools to make grinding less tedious  most notably, its fortune card system.
  Negative
Fortune cards offer up a handful of different challenges  for instance, you might need to gain a certain level or complete character-specific challenges  in exchange for large pools of in-game currency.
  Negative
You can get new cards in a daily draw or as rewards for leveling up characters.
  Neutral
Fortune cards are a great way to keep players coming back for more, and they add an incentive to try out new characters.
  Positive
This metagame is a much-needed mechanic to keep free-to-play players engaged with the game while they grind for currency.
  Positive
Grinding for new characters or cosmetics would be pointless if Gigantic didnt have a competitive scene to begin with.
  Negative
Thankfully, Motiga has built a community during the lifespan of its multiple betas.
  Positive
Even in its final beta period before its official launch, I didnt have much difficulty finding matches and competent folks to play against.
  Negative
The developers are active across social media and share weekly updates on their YouTube channel.
  Positive
This gives me hope that Gigantic will have a future even as it launches into an already crowded scene.
  Neutral
In some ways, Gigantic is a jack of all trades, pulling influences from half a dozen different disparate games and genres.
  Negative
That mixture might sound messy on paper, but in practice developer Motiga pulls it all together to create matches that feel tense, challenging and hugely rewarding.
  Positive
The time Ive invested into Gigantic so far feels worth it, and theres enough variety and enough new content planned already that I have no doubt Ill be jumping back in in the future.
  Positive
