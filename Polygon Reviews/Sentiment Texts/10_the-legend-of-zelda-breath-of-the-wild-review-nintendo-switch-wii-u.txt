With The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, one of the longest-running, most beloved video game franchises of all time feels like its finally moving forward.
  Positive
Its debatable whether or not Zelda as a series has been in a rut, and for how long, but its almost certainly fallen into a predictable pattern: an overworld with dungeons that offer items, which in turn allow access to new dungeons and means of traversal.
  Negative
Sure, each game had its own twist  a dark world, lycanthropy, sailing, flight  but there was a predictable path for each.
  Negative
It was a familiar loop, and a successful one, given the series regard.
  Very positive
Somewhere in the transition from the overhead perspective of the - and -bit Zelda titles to the third dimension added with the Nintendo s Ocarina of Time, Nintendo seemed to lose faith in players ability to figure things out.
  Negative
One of the worst offenders: relentless, unskippable introductory sections that could drag on for hours as each game made absolutely sure you understood how to play it  by having you perform the same basic mechanical tasks in numerous mundane ways.
  Very negative
But five and a half years since s Skyward Sword, Nintendo apparently rediscovered that faith.
  Negative
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is the biggest, most open Zelda game ever made, but it also brings with it a massive change in design philosophy, and the way it treats players.
  Positive
Breath of the Wild is the first main Zelda title since  s Link to the Past sequel A Link Between Worlds notwithstanding to feel like it respects its players implicitly.
  Negative
demands your respect.
  Neutral
And if you forget that for longer than a few minutes, itll remind you by knocking you flat on your ass.
  Negative
Breath of the Wild isnt without some of the same basic Zelda foundation.
  Negative
You play as Link, the hero of fantasy world Hyrule, though what that means and who Link is differs from previous games somewhat as it does in every Zelda game.
  Neutral
The story opens as a confused Link awakens to a world he doesnt recognize.
  Negative
Mystery is everywhere, from the hint of hyper-advanced fantasy technology to the evidence all around of a disastrous, society-ending war.
  Neutral
The narrative setup is more or less perfect for a Zelda game, because it provides just enough familiarity to feel like its supposed to for old fans, and leaves enough holes to instill a real sense of mystery.
  Positive
Link moves through the world like a ghost, and it suits the voiceless character well.
  Positive
New spins on familiar Zelda archetypes are typical from game to game, but Nintendos EPD team has also retooled many of the basic character tropes and ideas that have remained a constant for the series existence.
  Negative
There are character relationships at work that are not what you expect, and I was genuinely surprised by a number of implied stories and relationships.
  Positive
I expect Breath of the Wilds narrative and character departures from Zelda precedent to stir at least some amount of controversy, which is mostly a good thing.
  Negative
All of this is painted in the most sophisticated visual style and presentation Zelda has ever seen.
  Positive
The Wind Waker and Skyward Sword were striking in their own ways, but Breath of the Wild is their clear culmination.
  Positive
It is a frequently stunning, consistently striking visual achievement, evocative of legendary Japanese animation house Studio Ghiblis films in a way that seems lovingly influenced rather than derivative.
  Very positive
It also happens to include some of the best, most varied music the series has ever had, and, for the first time in a Zelda game, voice acting for a number of characters.
  Positive
In all likelihood, Nintendo could have made a traditional Zelda game with Breath of the Wilds art direction and production values and received the biggest accolades the series has seen since s Ocarina of Time.
  Positive
It looks that good.
  Positive
Of course, that isnt the game Nintendo made.
  Negative
If youve played any previous Zelda game, the following statement should rock you on your heels: Every mission-critical tool and item in Breath of the Wild is obtained within the first hour or two of play in an expanded sandbox that acts as a tutorial without mindless compulsory tasks.
  Negative
Breath of the Wilds various locations are gated behind specific kinds of equipment less than in any other third-person Zelda game.
  Negative
The geographic options in front of me felt almost overwhelming right from the start, and that was just in the opening space.
  Negative
Once you obtain a specific item that allows you to leave that plateau, Hyrule is your oyster.
  Negative
It just happens to be an oyster full of really angry monsters and ancient death machines that will murder you if they see you.
  Negative
Breath of the Wild is, without question or debate, the hardest Zelda game of the last  years.
  Positive
The first  minutes or so are pretty low-key  you can kill the scrub Bokoblins and other minor enemies you meet without much trouble, using nothing more than a tree branch picked up off the ground.
  Negative
But once you leave the initial learning spaces and venture into more typical zones, youre probably going to die.
  Negative
Youre probably going to die a lot, honestly.
  Positive
Often without much warning.
  Negative
Or at least I did.
  Neutral
Often, the only indication Breath of the Wild might give that you are under-equipped for the space youre in is an enemy taking you from, say, six hearts to a quarter of one in a single axe swipe or spear lunge assuming, you know, they dont just kill you outright.
  Negative
Or, like I said, theyll just kill you with no real fanfare or warning, and the game will reload you fairly close to where you were, with you hopefully having learned an important lesson about Hyrules ecosystem and its desire for you not to exist in it.
  Neutral
Comparisons to games like Dark Souls are probably inevitable, but theyre not exactly fair.
  Negative
You dont lose anything when you die, other than the time lost getting back to where you were.
  Negative
You do have to contend with equipment with a finite life span, however, and resources will often be scarce unless you gather ingredients to make potions and meals.
  Negative
getting out of its own way immediately, I really would have appreciated any tutorial whatsoever on cooking, something the game doesnt care to elaborate on in any meaningful way until well into the experience.
  Negative
Cooking and crafting is something Ive typically avoided in open-world action RPGs in the last several years; I find this kind of thing incredibly boring.
  Very negative
But for whatever reason, cooking and mixing in Breath of the Wild feels a little more loose and a little more immediately rewarding, and, well, its an absolute necessity.
  Negative
Theres a practical reason for this.
  Neutral
While spaces in Breath of the Wild arent item-gated, exactly, aside from the aforementioned enemies that will smash you, they can be beyond your physical capabilities.
  Negative
While Link is physically capable  he can climb most walls and use a sort of hang glider, and he can swim right away, no items required  more strenuous activity depletes Links limited stamina bar.
  Negative
However, if you cook the right things together, you can create meals and elixirs that, say, refill your stamina completely, or even give you temporary extra stamina that might allow you to reach a spot you otherwise couldnt.
  Neutral
Also, if you dont make meals that give you more than a heart or two back  or, eventually, that give you bonus temporary hearts  youre not going to survive against more powerful common enemies youll find out in the world.
  Negative
teaches you to play it, dont get me wrong.
  Negative
The plateau you start on gives you the powers and abilities youll use for much of the games puzzle solving via shrines, and each shrine is a series of instructional scenarios for a particular ability.
  Positive
But you can also screw around and kill Bokoblins and climb and explore the area to your hearts content, if thats what you want to do, and you could spend hours doing it before you left for the rest of Hyrule.
  Negative
, Im still looking for more.
  Neutral
Shrines arent the only place where Breath of the Wild invites quick thinking.
  Negative
Hyrule is full of emergent opportunities to push your basic understanding of the world and its rules, which only works because of how clever it all is.
  Positive
Weather and elements play a key role, and each act the way that they should, and, as importantly in a video game, Nintendo EPD goes out of its way to explain in multiple instances how that environment works.
  Positive
Many games  many Zelda games, even  are plagued by "video game logic," rules that masquerade as common sense but are, more often, the solutions a designer thought a problem should have.
  Negative
But Breath of the Wild teaches you again and again how things work, and the end result was a feeling of achievement in figuring things out that didnt just seem like guesswork.
  Positive
try skipping much of the games quest for a straight-shot gambit at Breath of the Wilds main threat.
  Negative
That sense of consistent achievement and discovery is incredibly important, because its the driving force behind Breath of the Wild.
  Very positive
Combat is functional, and I rarely died because of systemic inadequacies  and can I just, for a moment, appreciate playing a console Zelda title whose controls were not designed around motion input?
  Negative
Its really nice to not have to swing a Wiimote to use Breath of the Wilds arsenal.
  Negative
Even combat is subject to the same sort of discovery that makes Hyrule such a pleasure to explore, and subject to Breath of the Wilds experimental proclivities.
  Positive
Weapons are no longer permanent companions.
  Negative
This means youll need to learn how to use various options presented to you, and getting attached to any one thing is inviting heartbreak when it literally shatters on the last enemy youll ever hit with it.
  Positive
This includes bows, by the way.
  Negative
Other series staples have gained additional utility with their temporary life spans.
  Negative
Example: Boomerangs are now dual-use tools that can be wielded as melee weapons or thrown in traditional Zelda fashion, but if you do the latter, youll need to be quick and catch it on the way back.
  Negative
This adds another notable source of excitement to Breath of the Wild, which is important in part because of what the game takes away.
  Very positive
While this new take on Hyrule is crawling with dungeons and full of treasure chests, the dungeons lack the same kind of reward loop that proved so deeply satisfying in every other Zelda game.
  Negative
Set-piece dungeons in previous Zelda titles yielded key gear required to advance in the game, providing new abilities and opening up new areas of the map.
  Positive
In Breath of the Wild, those chests have weapons that will eventually break, or Rupees or, perhaps most anticlimactically, crafting materials.
  Negative
I can live with that kind of compromise, even if it was an absence that became more and more apparent over time.
  Negative
Breath of the Wilds other minor issues are less understandable.
  Negative
While the controls are generally excellent, especially on the Switchs Pro Controller, the camera can occasionally be a real jerk, particularly while using a bow around trees or fighting multiple enemies in tight quarters.
  Positive
And from a technical perspective, while Breath of the Wild is beautiful, playing the game docked on my TV often resulted in severe frame rate drops.
  Positive
It was never unplayable, but it was distracting.
  Negative
These problems never manifested while playing Breath of the Wild on the Switch undocked as a handheld.
  Negative
While that wasnt my preferred way to play  when the Pro Controller is an option, the Joy-Cons layouts feel like a punishment by comparison  there is something impressive about a full console Zelda experience on a handheld.
  Negative
I guess, in the end, its not just that Breath of the Wild signals that Zelda has finally evolved and moved beyond the structure its leaned on for so long.
  Positive
Its that the evolution in question has required Nintendo to finally treat its audience like intelligent people.
  Positive
That newfound respect has led to something big, and different, and exciting.
  Very positive
But in an open world full of big changes, Breath of the Wild also almost always feels like a Zelda game  and establishes itself as the first current, vital-feeling Zelda in almost  years.
  Positive
