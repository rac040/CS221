Dark Souls  may be the first crack in the armor  the first sign that FromSoftware cannot quite keep up with the breathless pace it has set for itself.
  Negative
Bloodborne, From has released a full game in its signature action role-playing style every spring  not to mention a full redesign of Dark Souls  as well.
  Positive
It's a release schedule that seems harsh when it comes to shooters like Call of Duty; for -plus-hour RPG epics, it's downright unfathomable.
  Very negative
Dark Souls  remains a deep, complicated, fascinating experience.
  Positive
But it's also one with some big flaws, weaknesses that are more visible and harder to ignore than they've ever been.
  Negative
Dark Souls  isn't a failure, but it's also a long shot from the well-honed RPG experience I've come to expect from the series.
  Negative
As with the previous Souls games, Dark Souls  tells an intriguing  if submerged  story: You take on the role of one of several "Unkindled," an undead hero cursed to wander the land of Lothric.
  Positive
The world is on the verge of an apocalyptic, unending darkness, and the only hope is to "link the fire" by hunting down and killing all the heroes who have linked the fire previously.
  Negative
It's a familiar setup, but it gets you to what really matters in the Souls formula: exploring a giant, interesting world and fighting really challenging enemies within it.
  Positive
For the latter point, FromSoftware clearly took criticisms of Dark Souls 's relatively mundane enemy lineup to heart.
  Negative
The third game in the series is full of the most unusual and inhuman opponents in its history.
  Negative
And when it does settle for human-shaped enemies, they're smarter and more demanding in combat than they've ever been.
  Negative
Dark Souls is a series known for its challenge, and Dark Souls 's combat easily tops the series in that regard.
  Neutral
Several of the game's bosses are far and away the hardest I've ever faced, encounters that I found intimidating and mechanically demanding.
  Positive
The game's final pair of boss fights, in particular, had me tearing my hair out.
  Negative
Even the most difficult enemies follow recognizable patterns, however; memorizing and overcoming these incredibly difficult opponents left me exhausted and weary but smiling.
  Very negative
FromSoftware has also added some new tools to deal with the increasing challenge.
  Positive
Most notably, each weapon in Dark Souls  features a "weapon skill," a new special move that can take the form of an ultra-powerful attack with a long windup, or a unique buff to your strength, or even a spell, like tossing a fireball.
  Negative
These new options add another layer to the combat scenarios, facilitated by the introduction of focus points.
  Negative
Focus points operate similarly to magic points in other RPGs, and in fact they're also used for casting spells now.
  Positive
Moment to moment, this means players have another resource they need to manage between the game's bonfire checkpoints, another wrinkle to Dark Souls 's already complex base combat.
  Negative
I never felt absolutely forced to use these new tools  outside of one or two gimmicky fights  but I enjoyed the added depth they provided, and they're likely to make the intense player-versus-player encounters even more ridiculous.
  Negative
I especially appreciated the strategic choice between a focus on traditional healing or restoring my focus points, a dilemma the series has never presented before.
  Negative
Dark Souls or Dark Souls .
  Neutral
Dodges and parries feel more necessary, and invincibility frames  that is, the time during which your character cannot be hurt after dodging  are more pronounced.
  Negative
This all adds up to a more dynamic combat system that remains as demanding and challenging as ever.
  Neutral
Perhaps the most disappointing part of Dark Souls  is that it is a complete technical mess  at least in the debug PlayStation  version that we played.
  Negative
We were playing a final build with the day-one patch applied, but the game still consistently ran terribly, with the frame rate stuttering and frequently dipping into or near the single digits across a variety of areas.
  Negative
We've also received a report of at least one repeatable crashing bug that Bandai Namco says will be patched soon after release.
  Negative
reportedly has issues of its own.
  Negative
The frame rate problems never detracted from my overall enjoyment of the game, but it was discouraging to see such a beautiful game made to run like sludge.
  Negative
We'll continue testing the game on new platforms and as patches are applied, and will update the review if these technical issues are improved.
  Positive
If only that dynamism were matched in Dark Souls 's world.
  Negative
Dark Souls  proved somewhat divisive in how its world leapt from area to area in ways that didn't make logical, geographical sense.
  Neutral
In some ways, Dark Souls 's world design seems like an extreme counter for these complaints, and not always for the better.
  Negative
It's logical to a fault  that fault being that it never really goes anywhere particularly interesting.
  Negative
The vast majority of your time in Dark Souls  will be spent in castles or the stone walkways of villages built beneath those castles.
  Negative
There's a swamp.
  Positive
There are some catacombs.
  Neutral
It's all stuff we've seen before, and while I wouldn't expect a game with no repeated themes, I was disappointed at how few surprises Dark Souls  had waiting.
  Very negative
Some of that lack of surprise also rests on the game's frustratingly linear design.
  Negative
Both Dark Souls and Dark Souls  as well as Bloodborne followed a formula of starting in a contained space that slowly blossoms into ever more complex patterns.
  Negative
You begin with one direction to go in; you end up with many choices, exploring each and whittling them down one by one.
  Positive
In Dark Souls , I only had one or maybe two paths to explore the whole time.
  Negative
Most of the side paths that I left behind and then returned to were extremely short, ending virtual feet from where they began.
  Negative
I never felt lost or overwhelmed by this massive world; in previous games, those emotions played a vital role in Dark Souls' captivating sense of exploration.
  Positive
Dark Souls 's level design feels less ... intentional, in a way that extends well beyond the size or complexity of the world.
  Negative
At a Souls game's best, finding a bonfire to rest at or unlocking a new shortcut brings an intense wave of relief, a sense of exhilaration at having survived the latest challenge.
  Very positive
Here, I was left saying 'huh?'
  Negative
or shrugging my shoulders just as often as I felt positive.
  Positive
So many of the shortcuts are spaced poorly, presented at moments where they don't really make a significant impact.
  Negative
In one particularly noteworthy instance near the end of the game, I defeated a tough boss, which places a bonfire in the boss room.
  Negative
I rested up and left the room to explore the next area and, less than a minute's walk from the boss room, still in sight of that bonfire, I found ... another bonfire.
  Negative
Just beyond this, I stumbled onto a locked door.
  Negative
Where the series would normally tuck the keys away into some obscure corner, requiring exploration or maybe taking out a difficult miniboss, here they were on a corpse directly in front of the door.
  Negative
Hard to feel accomplished about that discovery.
  Positive
It's not that Dark Souls  doesn't have secrets.
  Negative
It has plenty that I found and, I'm sure, lots that I haven't discovered yet.
  Positive
But after years of being groomed to expect confusion and aimless wandering, I couldn't help but be disappointed in the boring, straightforward main path.
  Negative
here.
  Neutral
