Ones and Zeroes, solidifies the stealth focus of the series while spinning its paranoid dystopia plot into exciting new directions.
  Negative
On top of that, the newly released Republique Remastered moves the whole experience to a much more suitable  if less meta-fictionally clever  platform.
  Negative
At the end of the last episode, Republique protagonist Hope had seemingly been captured.
  Negative
As Episode  kicks off, you resume your role as Hope's mysterious hackerprotector and discover that she has escaped her captor ... somehow.
  Positive
Not only that, but she's closer than ever to the elevator that will take her out of the authoritarian underground society she was born into.
  Negative
Between her and that freedom: an army of patrolling guards.
  Positive
Republique has largely avoided straightforward violence throughout, and Episode  continues that trend.
  Negative
However, Hope gets a few new tools, most notably the ability to see where guards are on the map and a weapon called "sleep mines" that swiftly knock out any guards that step on them.
  Neutral
Both of these tools build on Republique's clever stealth tendencies, which make each room a puzzle to solve.
  Negative
How do you sneak through this office with three armored thugs whose patrols intersect?
  Neutral
In one situation, I carefully followed patrols on the map, caused a telephone to ring to alter one guard's path, and watched him walk right into a sleep mine I had placed.
  Negative
The map ability makes planning these paths easier than ever by eliminating any uncertainty about whether a guard is hiding just out of view of your camera.
  Negative
If Republique Episode  has the most thoughtful gameplay and plot of the series so far, the new Remastered version for PC also handily provides the best visuals as well.
  Positive
Far from a mere up-rezzed look, Republique on PC features much more detailed environments and character models.
  Positive
It's still clearly targeting playability on lower-end hardware, but you're not going to mistake this for a phone game while playing.
  Negative
If anything, playing Republique Remastered makes me frustrated that the series didn't start out on PC.
  Negative
Camouflaj set out to prove that a great, hardcore game could work on mobile platforms.
  Positive
Now with the series over half-done, the audience that could most appreciate Republique may have already passed it by.
  Negative
Here's hoping that's not the case, because this is some of the most entertaining and clever dystopian fiction ever realized in game form.
  Positive
As in previous episodes, part of the draw is not just overcoming guards but pickpocketing them and actively digging into their private information.
  Negative
Republique Episode  takes this invasion of privacy to another level.
  Negative
In order to clear her way to the exit, Hope must remove multiple guards by looking through their personal history and crafting propaganda news reports that frame them.
  Negative
Once you've found all the dirt you can on each guard, you have to choose an incriminating photo and a tidbit of recorded audio taken out of context that will make them seem guilty.
  Negative
Call it fighting fire with fire, but Hope is understandably uncomfortable with this task.
  Negative
It's one of the most interesting parts of the game so far, something that takes the obsessive collectibles and backstory all over Republique and attaches a fascinating gameplay hook to it.
  Very positive
These segments also provide a wider view of the world outside Republique's underground empire.
  Negative
As I learned about the past of several characters, I started to piece together the time frame for the game and even entertained some ideas about where in the world it takes place.
  Positive
Developer Camouflaj has made it clear that all of this is taking place in a recognizable modern world, but it has wisely made deciphering the wheres and hows of that world part of the game's overall puzzle.
  Positive
While Ones and Zeroes doesn't completely change the formula for Republique, I continue to be impressed by Camouflaj's willingness to add mechanics and expand the game with each new episode.
  Positive
The series has grown from a scrappy stealth contender into what increasingly feels like an essential exploration of video game dystopias.
  Negative
If you were still on the fence, it's time to catch up.
  Positive
here.
  Neutral
