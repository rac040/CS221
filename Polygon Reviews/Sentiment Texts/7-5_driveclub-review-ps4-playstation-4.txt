I love racing games, but I'm one of those odd ones who often prefers playing alone.
  Positive
It's fun to know that I'm beating my friends, but I usually want to jump into a race, zoom through and cross the finish line without having to get together a group of people or wait around in a lobby.
  Positive
DriveClub's greatest contribution to the racing genre is how it manages to seamlessly blend the act of racing solo with asynchronous competition against your friends.
  Very positive
That one major boon is aided by a solid if unremarkable core and some of the best visuals of this generation so far.
  Very positive
From the start, DriveClub is a relatively no-frills driving experience.
  Negative
There's a tour mode that lets you work through mostly racing-focused events building up to amateur, pro and legend trophy tournaments.
  Negative
You can jump into a single event across -some tracks that send you all around the world, from Canada to Scotland to India.
  Neutral
And then a multiplayer mode allows you to register for scheduled competitive events, such as Italian and German sports cars facing off on a snowy Norwegian mountain.
  Negative
All of these basics are easy to access through DriveClub's slick menu presentation.
  Positive
Once I got into the races, I quickly discovered that the game feels right in that kind-of-intangible way that good racing games pull off.
  Positive
The track design is solid and uses smart visual cues in the form of colored flags to help you prepare for sharp corners.
  Very positive
DriveClub falls more on the arcade than simulation side of the genre, but it still manages to make each of its cars feel accurately different.
  Positive
Those differences are especially notable in DriveClub's first-person cockpit view, which I strongly recommend using.
  Negative
Every car has a unique, fully rendered interior, and there's no better way to take in the game's gorgeous environments than through this point of view.
  Positive
It's not just the world itself that's impressive in DriveClub.
  Negative
It's the small shifts in your view  the way the sun gets in your eyes when you come over a hill, or the minor but perceptible change in how far ahead on the track you can see when the sky turns gloomy.
  Negative
Rotating weather and daynight cycles feel less like back-of-the-box bullet points here and more like a necessity to the whole experience.
  Negative
The races look great, but DriveClub's main hook is its smart, multi-level progression system.
  Positive
Any time you're in an event, regardless of whether single or multiplayer, you'll notice points flashing across your screen for various skillful actions  passing a competitor, drifting, completing a section of a race without going off the track and so on.
  Negative
You can also lose points by slamming into another car or crashing into a barrier.
  Negative
At the end of each race, your total points earned are calculated and added to your Driver Level.
  Negative
Each level gained earns new cars, which in turn allow you to perform better in future events.
  Positive
Some people are going to dislike how DriveClub forces you to wait for unlocks rather than allowing you to purchase vehicles at your discretion.
  Negative
For me, this design choice simply provided encouragement to keep moving through new events in tour mode, cycling back around to previous events with unlocked vehicles later on.
  Negative
It kept me trying different things instead of hitting my head against a single event that I couldn't improve on.
  Negative
While club functionality and challenges were up and running during our review, we had a limited amount of time with DriveClub's multiplayer event mode on pre-release servers.
  Negative
We'll continue testing this feature following the game's launch and will update our review if it significantly impacts our assessment of the game.
  Positive
Your progression and unlocks will be aided greatly if you're part of a "driveclub," the titular draw of the game.
  Positive
When you join a driveclub with up to five other friends, all of your points earned will also be added into a second pool that increases your club's level.
  Negative
As a club levels up, all of its members gain access to special cars as well as unique logos and paint jobs.
  Positive
This allows for a sense of progress even when you're not playing; every time I turned on the game to discover my club had gained a level or two and opened up a new car, I felt more motivated to keep playing and contribute to that effort.
  Positive
While the additional vehicles and visual flourishes are nice, clubs also expand the best part of the game: face-offs.
  Positive
Though racing is the core of the DriveClub experience, the game is always offering up other things to do on top of that.
  Positive
As I blasted through one lap-based race in an arid, mountainous region in Chile, I came across a section of the track with multiple tight corners packed up one right after the other.
  Positive
An orange box floating above the track before the first turn indicated a cornering face-off.
  Positive
Once I passed the box, a line appeared on the track showing off the perfect line to take through these corners  the longer I stuck to that line, the more points I got.
  Negative
In addition to providing boosts to my overall experience gain upon a track's completion, face-offs were crucial to keeping me engaged in DriveClub at all times.
  Negative
Particularly for a game that's missing some of the extras I've grown used to with racing games over the last generation  there's no rewind option and no ability to use an always-on driving line  face-offs convinced me to keep going even when I was having a bad race and was not likely to fulfill my main objectives.
  Very negative
Those primary objectives are surprisingly diverse as well.
  Positive
Each event in tour mode comes with two or three goals; a top-three finish is almost always one of those, but even if you can't pull that off, there's other stuff to aim for.
  Negative
In one memorable event midway through the amateur portion of the tour, I was put into a faster car than I'd ever driven previously and one of my goals was to hit  miles per hour at some point during the race.
  Positive
I may have ended up flipping the car, but damn it, I pulled it off.
  Negative
Even if you manage to clear out every one of those objectives in tour mode and take home the Legend trophy, DriveClub has a potentially endless source of new content in the form of player-created challenges.
  Negative
Think you're better than your buddies at drifting through the Hurrungane track in Norway?
  Neutral
You can turn that into a challenge and forward it along to your friends, and then let them forward it to their friends as well.
  Positive
Once the timer expires for the challenge, each player who has participated will win experience points based off their placement.
  Positive
Challenges can be focused on solo players or presented to whole clubs, but whatever form you prefer, they provide a great quick hit of entertainment.
  Positive
I often turned to them as a nice opener when I was first starting a session of DriveClub or as a great way to close out my evening with the game.
  Positive
Also, as with face-offs, challenges provide the competitive rush of multiplayer without actually having to deal with other people, which I greatly appreciated.
  Negative
here.
  Neutral
its disastrous launch.
  Neutral
But what really concerned me as I returned to test it out six months after the game's launch was the question of if it was too little too late.
  Negative
Was there still going to be an online community around to take advantage of the technical fixes to what had been, in my original estimation, a rather good game?
  Positive
As it turns out, yeah, there totally is.
  Negative
In tests at various times of day throughout the last few weeks, I've had almost no trouble ever finding a multiplayer match.
  Negative
All the social hooks I liked are now working perfectly, and Evolution Studios has a constant rotation of events, encouraging players to compete across a wide variety of tracks and vehicles.
  Very positive
the addition of a weather system.
  Neutral
Snow and rain bring new layers to the game, adding potential for a repeated race or even a second lap to feel completely different.
  Positive
It's debatable whether DriveClub is actually a better game than it was with the addition of new tracks and cars and the weather system, but it's certainly more of what was already good.
  Neutral
And, most importantly, it all works now.
  Positive
While I was impressed with Driveclub's smart social media-inspired challenges and team-up mechanics, all of these elements have one major requirement: functioning online support.
  Negative
While online servers worked flawlessly with the lighter load prior to launch, they have more or less ceased to function in the disastrous week since the game launched.
  Negative
According to developer Evolution Studios, the server problems are not just from high player load but tied into actual buggy server code in the game.
  Negative
Whatever the issue, we have not been able to connect to Driveclub's online options at all since launch day.
  Negative
This includes the multiplayer modes, challenges and clubs, the latter of which has vehicles locked behind it as well.
  Very positive
Driveclub still features solid racing without its online features, but the tour mode alone is not enough to pull in serious attention.
  Neutral
Challenges and clubs are a core, necessary part of the game, and they are currently largely inaccessible.
  Positive
It's a shell of the game it's supposed to be.
  Neutral
As such, we're updating our Driveclub score until such a time as we have evidence that the game's servers are consistently up and running.
  Positive
