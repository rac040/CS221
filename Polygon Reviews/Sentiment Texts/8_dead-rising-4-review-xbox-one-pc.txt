Dead Rising  is a game with very specific, holiday-focused timing.
  Positive
Its not that the fourth proper Dead Rising game  and the third from Capcom Vancouver, which took over for the Japanese publisher with the second installment  is the only game this year to take place in a holiday setting.
  Neutral
Ubisofts The Division launched in March with a similar premise: a viral disaster that began during the pre-Christmas Black Friday shopping rush.
  Negative
But where The Divisions tone is a generally serious, disquieting look at society held together by a frayed string, Dead Rising s is ... not.
  Negative
In fact, the smashed-together combination of gore, slapstick and Christmas is the kind of mashup rarely seen in video games.
  Negative
Dead Rising  isnt without issues  some of which chip away at the series defining characteristics in ways that will surely prove divisive.
  Negative
But right at this moment, the return of Frank West feels like a much-needed catharsis for big-budget open-world games.
  Negative
Dead Rising  sees the reluctant hero who started the series return, as Frank West once again finds himself stuck in a mess hes surprisingly capable of navigating, given the fact that hes kind of a dipshit.
  Negative
Frank is largely doing the same things this time around.
  Neutral
Hes still got his camera, which has been modified to allow for a kind of investigation minigame at various points, one very familiar from countless other titles at this point.
  Negative
Youre still fusing various tools and household items  or, occasionally, vehicles  into bizarre and deadly new combo weapons.
  Negative
My favorite is the Gandelf, which is made from a spear and a holiday garden elf.
  Negative
Which shoots exploding elves, and can be slammed down on the ground like  well, you get it.
  Negative
The setting this time around is also familiar: the fictional Colorado town of Willamette, the scene of the original zombie outbreak in the original Dead Rising.
  Negative
Willamette was rebuilt in the  years following those events, but the city held more secrets.
  Negative
A fugitive Frank is forced to once again face his shambling demons, this time surrounded by snow and Christmas decorations.
  Negative
And Christmas presents.
  Positive
And Christmas songs.
  Positive
Did I mention that Dead Rising  takes place around Christmas?
  Negative
This is probably my favorite thing about Dead Rising .
  Very positive
Zombie games arent unique anymore.
  Positive
Even open-world zombie games are fairly commonplace.
  Neutral
This is, for example, the fourth Dead Rising game.
  Neutral
Christmas, on the other hand, adds a unifying theme to Dead Rising  that glues everything together, and gives minor points of exploration for some of the series old staples, like Maniacs, several of whom are holiday-themed.
  Positive
But compared to previous Dead Rising games, the Maniacs  themed boss characters who were previously referred to as Psychopaths, rebranded in what appears to be a not entirely successful attempt to make them less offensive with a new name  have been considerably de-emphasized.
  Negative
There are still boss battles, but theyre generally against much more pedestrian enemies, like soldiers in power armor or particularly strong zombies.
  Negative
Meanwhile, Maniacs are side quests, easily skippable if youd rather not get involved, with little of the drama or presentation seen in previous games.
  Negative
This is a consistent thing in Dead Rising .
  Neutral
Stuff that was a Big Deal before has been considerably mitigated.
  Negative
For example, you can still save non-infected humans from zombies for a small reward.
  Negative
Before, you had to babysit survivors on their way back to a safehouse, or give them weapons and hope for the best, but here, once theyre saved, theyre good.
  Negative
They go right back on their way.
  Positive
Its one less point of failure for the player, and Dead Rising  has fewer of them than any game in the series.
  Very negative
The most game-changing shift, however, has to do with scarcity  or the lack no pun intended thereof.
  Negative
Inventory space used to be at a premium, with limited room for food and weapons.
  Negative
But now Frank has separate collections of slots for grenades, melee weapons, ranged weapons and healing items, each of which can be upgraded.
  Neutral
By the end of Dead Rising  I had about eight slots for weapons and four for healing items, meaning I was carrying around a sleighs worth of murder toys at any given moment.
  Negative
This has the side effect of making Dead Rising  the easiest of the series by far.
  Neutral
The capricious save system seen in previous Dead Rising games is replaced by a generous checkpoint-and-autosave system here, but that didnt really matter to me, because I never died in my -hour playthrough of the game.
  Negative
Im OK at games like Dead Rising, but Im not amazing, and by the end I was pretty surprised to have walked away from the game figuratively unscathed.
  Negative
That change  the absence of real threat  makes Dead Rising  feel a lot different, even if it plays largely the same.
  Negative
And if scarcity and tension are what you were always coming to Dead Rising to experience, I think youll be disappointed.
  Negative
However, this results in an open-world game almost entirely dedicated to screwing around, and causing as much carnage against dozens or hundreds of enemies at a time as possible.
  Neutral
Without the risk of previous games, I got sidetracked annihilating zombies more often  just sort of spacing out behind the wheel of a pickup truck and seeing how high I could rack up the combo meter in the game.
  Negative
It was ... relaxing.
  Neutral
Throughout my time with Dead Rising , I never hit a showstopping bug that halted my progress in the game, but I did see some occasional weirdness.
  Negative
At one point a Maniac side mission wouldnt complete, and character models occasionally got stuck on vehicles or other geometry.
  Negative
A number of reviewers at other sites also reported more serious issues with the game, including severe glitches and freezing in the final "case."
  Negative
I didnt encounter the problem, but it warrants caution, and Ill be checking forums and other venues to see if this is a persistent thing or a limited event.
  Negative
With that in mind, consider this review provisional until we can determine more about the launch state of the game.
  Negative
Its extremely weird to call a Dead Rising game relaxing, and there are a few moments where I thought I might almost get Frank killed, but they were rare.
  Negative
And this makes Dead Rising  feel more like an exploration playground than it has before.
  Negative
I didnt really care if a weapon was effective if it was funny, for example.
  Positive
I also spent more time taking photos in Dead Rising  than I did when the mechanic was originally in place in Dead Rising, even though the material benefit is basically nonexistent, shy of some experience rewards.
  Negative
But once again, I didnt care.
  Negative
It was something I did because it was fun to do, and the in-game scoring was meaningless but oddly motivating.
  Positive
Dead Rising  is a collection of exactly this kind of stuff, and I found myself drawn in.
  Negative
This is sometimes helped and sometimes not by the in-game story, which starts with a fairly interesting new conspiracy hook for the series fiction.
  Positive
Which the game just ... sort of drops after an hour or two, for something more predictable and less interesting.
  Negative
There are fewer friendships for Frank to navigate than Dead Rising  hero Nick Ramos had, but the relationship between Frank and his student Vick adds new depth to the protagonist.
  Neutral
For players who are more invested in Dead Risings survival roots, there is one potential lifeline in Dead Rising s multiplayer component.
  Negative
While cooperative play is bizarrely omitted from the main game  despite some vehicles seeming specifically designed for it  the separate online mode places up to four players in a series of escalating scenarios with a more traditional inventory system and much less resilient characters.
  Neutral
Survival there is far less assured, and you can run it alone, if you want to.
  Negative
Dead Rising  has thousands of zombies to kill, with an omnipresent Christmas theme thats bizarre, unifying and, strangely, soothing.
  Negative
Right now, as we all wind our way toward the end of a very confusing, often sad and traumatic year, I found myself enjoying the opportunity to get lost in it without having to think about it very much.
  Negative
Dead Rising  may not be smart, but I was never bored.
  Negative
here.
