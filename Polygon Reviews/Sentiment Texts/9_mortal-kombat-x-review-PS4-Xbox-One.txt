There was a time when the Mortal Kombat series used to be about one-upmanship.
  Negative
The original arcade game outdid Street Fighter's violence with its showers of blood and  for its time  graphically violent Fatalities.
  Negative
Successive Mortal Kombat entries have attempted to outdo what came before, piling on new finishing moves, adding mini-game distractions and ballooning its roster.
  Negative
With 's Mortal Kombat, developer NetherRealm Studios got back to basics, focusing on classic characters, overhauling the fighting game's mechanics and resetting two decades' worth of convoluted fiction.
  Negative
Mortal Kombat X builds on the  game's framework, both in its story and its technical implementation; the game's fighting mechanics have been refined more than they've been reinvented, save for a key addition that adds variety, not just complexity.
  Positive
Mortal Kombat X boasts a robust set of single-player modes, but it's the main story mode where NetherRealm has clearly spent the bulk of its time.
  Negative
Over the course of a dozen chapters, each focused on a particular fighter, players battle their way through a story that picks up where the previousMortal Kombat left off.
  Negative
The campaign of MKX, which runs a pretty lean four to five hours, jumps back and forth between events set during the  years immediately following Mortal Kombat, through various dimensions and across its political factions.
  Negative
You'll mainly play as Mortal Kombat's good guys  or at least those who seem like they're on the right side of the conflict at any given time   in one-on-one fights interwoven between pre-rendered cutscenes.
  Neutral
You'll do about as much watching as you will playing; some of the cutscenes that intersperse fights run a good five minutes or more, some are peppered with quick time event-style button prompts that give these moments more of an interactive movie feel.
  Negative
Fortunately, the story of Mortal Kombat X is pretty great, in a silly, sci-fi kung fu movie way.
  Neutral
NetherRealm throws in a couple satisfying cameos and nods for players who stuck with Mortal Kombat after the third game in the franchise, and there are a few moments where things get serious.
  Positive
Family relationships are touched on throughout the campaign, and it's fun to see the dynamics of Mortal Kombat X's mothers, fathers, sons and daughters explored.
  Positive
The story is complex, stuffed with playable and non-playable combatants from throughout the franchise, but NetherRealm juggles all those characters deftly.
  Negative
The cast is a mix of old, new and vaguely familiar.
  Neutral
The playable roster boasts about two dozen fighters, including veterans Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Mileena, Kitana and Sonya Blade.
  Negative
MKX also explores the next-generation of fighters in a literal way; the daughters and sons of Johnny Cage, Sonya.
  Negative
Kenshi and Jax are introduced, as are a handful of all-new creations, including two particularly fun Outworld-born characters, the insect-like D'Vorah and two-in-one fighter FerraTorr.
  Positive
Notably, X features one of the lowest ninja quotients of any Mortal Kombat game.
  Negative
That's my way of saying that the cast shows a welcome diversity of characters young and old, men and women, human and non-human.
  Positive
NetherRealm has also thankfully simplified the over-complicated and sometimes gaudy design of some of its characters, and the women in Mortal Kombat X are far less sexualized than they've been in the past, with outfits that feel more appropriate for life or death fights.
  Negative
While Mortal Kombat X's initial character roster is smaller than that of previous games, NetherRealm has essentially tripled the number of characters to choose from, thanks to the new Variations system.
  Positive
Every character in MKX comes with three fighting styles that dramatically mixes up their special move set, which have a big impact on each character's tactics.
  Positive
A fighter like Jax, for example, might play more like a grappler in one variation Wrestler, but be more effective in zoning his opponent in another variation Heavy Weapons.
  Negative
Veteran characters like Scorpion or Sub-Zero will always have their signature moves  spear and ice ball, respectively  across variations, but they'll be outfitted with other complementary attacks.
  Negative
Scorpion can summon a demon in one variation, while Sub-Zero can create ice clones of himself in another.
  Neutral
In the dozens of matches of Mortal Kombat X that I've played online via a wi-fi connection, I've experienced a wide variety of technical performance.
  Positive
Some early matches felt a bit sluggish, while others had a handful of full-second delays in action as the networking code caught up.
  Negative
But recently, the game's online performance has seemed solid; I've experienced a few fights that felt almost indistinguishable from offline fights.
  Positive
We'll be keeping an eye on the game's online performance at launch.
  Positive
An online component of the game we haven't spent much time with is Faction Wars, the persistent meta-game.
  Negative
With Faction Wars, players can join one of five groups, and simply by playing the game both in single-player and online multiplayer, contribute to that group's global standing.
  Negative
Virtually everything a player does in Mortal Kombat X contributes to their faction in some way, adding experience points to the overall pool.
  Positive
Players will be rewarded faction-specific rewards if their chosen group is at the top of the global weekly ranking, but we haven't experienced those rewards ourselves or seen what material benefit they'll have.
  Positive
It also remains to be seen if the Lin Kuei Sub-Zero's group will ever not be the game's dominant faction, as it's currently the faction most players seem to have aligned themselves with.
  Negative
Exploring those variations, finding one that suits your particular play style, or even opening yourself up to understanding new possibilities for a particular fighter, can be a lot of fun.
  Positive
The implementation of Variations is brilliant: NetherRealm has given players a familiar foundation upon which to relearn characters they've been playing with for decades.
  Positive
New in X is a stamina bar that depletes as players dash, run and break combos.
  Neutral
The stamina bar appears to limit the effectiveness of some zoning strategies, while making it a little tougher to break your opponent's combos.
  Negative
It's hard to say at this stage what the real impact of the stamina meter will have on MKX competitive play, but your opinion of it will probably depend on whether you were on the giving or receiving end of zoning spam in past games.
  Negative
Beyond story mode, players have plenty to experience in single-player.
  Negative
Towers return, allowing players to climb ladders of one-on-one fights, and Living Towers offer new, daily challenges, where players may be fighting upside-down or at twice the speed, or dealing with rockets and grenades raining down upon them in others.
  Negative
The Krypt also returns, albeit modified somewhat  it's now more like a first-person dungeon crawler.
  Positive
You'll find items, unlock secret areas, solve puzzles and even battle monsters in order to unlock everything MKX has to offer.
  Negative
It's a bit clunky to move around in, but it's also incredibly charming.
  Positive
Online, Mortal Kombat X offers a comprehensive set of competitive modes, including one-on-one fights, team battles and King of the Hill, where up to eight players can get together in a room and fight for the top spot.
  Negative
King of the Hill remains a great place to learn new techniques and show off your skills, and NetherRealm has made the venue better than ever for playing competitively.
  Positive
A new online mode called Tower Battles serves as sort of a hybrid between single-player and online multiplayer.
  Negative
Tower Battles are essentially online versions of the game's challenge towers, in which players will compete for the highest score in a particular challenge.
  Negative
You're still fighting against computer-controlled opponents with various modifiers and win conditions, but you're doing so in real-time against other players.
  Neutral
In between matches, you'll get a glimpse of how your competitors are doing, which can add a real sense of tension.
  Negative
It's a fun competitive option for players who might not yet be ready or too intimidated to explore the more direct player-versus-player modes.
  Positive
NetherRealm has perfected many of the mechanics of Mortal Kombat and it's also reached a new level of violence with Mortal Kombat X.  Fatalities are more gruesome, more graphically violent than ever.
  Negative
Characters are split and sliced in half in newly disturbing detail, and the dripping viscera on display is more unsettling in its realism than ever before.
  Negative
This is a pretty sickening game if you don't like the sight of blood.
  Neutral
I've always given the sadistic violence of Mortal Kombat a pass, because it's so ridiculously over the top that it's hard to take seriously.
  Negative
We've seen allies brutally kill each other in other MK games, but it sure is a new level of creepy to see Jax crack his daughter's head in half or watch Cassie Cage delight in tearing off her father's jaw.
  Negative
The slightly-less violent finishing moves, Brutalities, are a fantastic addition in X.
  Positive
They require a lot more skill to pull off that the rote input memorization of Fatalities, and add some real flair to multiplayer matches.
  Negative
Players need to meet certain match conditions to pull off a Brutality  Mileena, for example, might need to successfully land five Rolling Thunder moves in one match and finish the fight with that particular move  so there's a real sense of accomplishment when you pull one off.
  Negative
Brutalities add a new level of mind game to Mortal Kombat, as you might start to notice that an opponent is behaving a bit strangely, then realize that they're trying to catch you with the new finisher.
  Negative
There's also a palpable sense of humiliation when someone manages to finish you with a Brutality, especially when other players might be watching in a King of the Hill match.
  Positive
It's a new finishing move, yes, but it's also another successful step in replicating the classic Mortal Kombat arcade experience.
  Positive
Mortal Kombat X is friendly both to casual players who want to experience its rich suite of single-player content and knock around with some friends, but deep enough for competitive players who want to plumb its roster and variations.
  Positive
It's a robust, feature-rich competitive fighting game that hones what's worked for NetherRealm Studios in past games, and even shows hints of restraint and maturity amidst the gory hyper-violence.
  Negative
Paired with an ambitious online meta-game, Mortal Kombat X is one of the best fighting games in the series.
  Positive
Note: While Mortal Kombat X was reviewed using retail copies, multiplayer servers have not been operative for long enough to be certain of the game's stability.
  Negative
As such, this review will remain provisional until we have a clearer idea of MKX's launch state.
  Negative
here.
  Neutral
After spending more time withMortal Kombat X online and the Faction Wars meta game, we're confident in removing the provisional status of our review, but we're somewhat disappointed with how things have shaken out post-launch.
  Negative
Online performance in Mortal Kombat X on PlayStation  and Xbox Onehas seen improvements since launch, thanks to a handful of software updates, but it can still be unreliable.
  Negative
Matchmaking has also been problematic, as we've rarely found ourselves matched with similarly skilled opponents  an entirely reasonable expectation for a competitive game in .
  Negative
After a bumpy initial roll out, the Faction Wars component seems to be mostly working as intended though the reward for participating in faction-based battles feels like little more than a well-meaning distraction.
  Negative
Faction Wars just doesn't add a compelling reason to invest more time in Mortal Kombat X beyond the game's other competitive fighting modes.
  Negative
We've seen numerous user reports of online stability problems and matchmaking difficulties on the Windows PC version, which we have not sufficiently tested.
  Negative
As such, we're refraining from assigning a final score to the PC version of Mortal Kombat X.
  Neutral
