Record Breaker definitely takes advantage of that.
  Positive
But that's only the bottom-most layer of gameplay.
  Negative
The turn-based battles are wrapped in a cloak of strategy gameplay, which is then clothed in a heavy narrative coat of choice-based visual novel stylings.
  Negative
What's especially impressive about Devil Survivor  is not just how it draws on these various, disparate styles of gameplay.
  Negative
Rather, I was thrilled by the way it ties them so tightly together and finds ways for each to interact with each other in a way that feels natural.
  Negative
Devil Survivor : Record Breaker begins like a deliciously evil urban legend: The player-created protagonist and his friend Daichi download a new smartphone app called Nicaea.
  Negative
The rumor going around school is that this app will send you videos of your friends dying before it happens.
  Negative
Sure enough, within minutes of our heroes signing up, they receive videos of each other dying in a horrible subway accident.
  Negative
While the main characters are of course able to avoid their deaths, things only get worse from there as a mysterious disaster strikes Tokyo and demons appear all over the city.
  Negative
The story follows the protagonist, Daichi, and a ragtag group of friends they assemble as they explore a post-apocalyptic Japan and try to figure out what exactly happened.
  Negative
Shin Megami Tensei franchise: It's not another generic fantasy RPG.
  Negative
Sure, there are some anime tropes at play here  particularly with the protagonists being "chosen ones" of a sort with a special power that allows them to battle the forces of evil  but generally the characters are all regular teenagers with regular teenager attitudes and issues.
  Negative
The extraordinary situation they're thrust into lends the game an air of mystery and suspense, but it never feels like it totally overrides the simple human drama of young people confronting their own mortality in the wake of a huge disaster.
  Negative
Of course, they're also given some agency in how they respond to the disaster, which comes in two forms.
  Negative
First, narratively: Record Breaker's story progresses via lengthy, fully-voiced cutscenes.
  Negative
Players are usually given anywhere from two-to-five options of which area to visit next, and depending on the path, you may recruit new characters, save lives or lose allies whose cries for help you ignored.
  Negative
The penalties can feel harsh, but they never feel arbitrary; I was given plenty of warning and time to prepare for battles where a character's survival in the plot was on the line.
  Very negative
To save these characters, you'll need to master the second form of agency for our heroes: Record Breaker's excellent combat system.
  Positive
Every time you enter a combat scenario, you can bring a party of up to four human characters.
  Positive
Each human can be flanked by two different demon companions, essentially giving you four groups of three characters each.
  Negative
Those groups move around individually on an overhead, grid-based map  a classic strategy game setup.
  Negative
It's not that simple, though.
  Negative
In an interesting twist on genre norms, when one group clashes with another on the battlefield, the view switches to a traditional turn-based RPG combat screen.
  Positive
Both the player and enemy teams go through a single round of combat and then are placed back out on the battlefield screen.
  Negative
Record Breaker is technically a DS re-release of the original Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor , which came out on the original Nintendo DS in .
  Negative
But rather than a straight port, Atlus has gone back and added quite a bit to the game.
  Positive
Most notably, Record Breaker includes a complete second campaign that picks up where the original game's story ended.
  Negative
Though it's not quite as long, this add-on is still meaty, easily packing an extra  hours onto the already lengthy original campaign.
  Positive
It also twists the story in some fun new directions that fans of the original game will probably want to see for themselves.
  Positive
The other big addition to Record Breaker is full voice acting, including in the original campaign.
  Positive
Atlus has returned to the original script and recording new voiceovers for every human character  demons and other enemies remain unvoiced, but that eerie silence fits the bizarre creations of this series.
  Negative
Beyond those two changes, Record Breaker is full of tiny quality of life improvements, such as the ability to fast-forward past events to improve replays of the game.
  Positive
It also includes an easier difficulty setting, a godsend for less hardcore fans who still want to experience this excellent game.
  Negative
In a worse game, this extra layer to combat could have felt unnecessary.
  Negative
After all, many strategy RPGs have had plenty of depth with just strategy combat  with two sides clashing and taking turns on the map alone.
  Negative
But Record Breaker builds something wonderfully complex yet not overwhelming out of its multi-level battles.
  Positive
I found myself pulled in by the process of putting together the perfect team of demons, picking the best spells to cast on any given turn of a battle, optimizing my chances for critical hits which grant bonus attacks.
  Positive
I always felt on the verge of failure but with all the necessary information to how to improve when I failed  a tension that made my successes feel outstanding.
  Negative
As with other Shin Megami Tensei games, Record Breaker also throws a Pokemon-style demon collection meta-game on top of everything.
  Negative
By purchasing demons at an auction house, you can bring them to your side.
  Positive
From there, you can fuse demons together to form new monstrosities that carry over some of the skills of the previous generation.
  Negative
There is a frankly absurd amount of depth to this formula, though much of it is blessedly optional.
  Negative
If you want to spend hours grinding for cash and extra levels to put together the most incredible, overpowered team of demons possible, you're allowed to do so via "Free Battles" on the map screen.
  Negative
As someone who's not as obsessed with min-maxing, I was able to keep moving on with the story with a limited but enjoyable amount of time spent messing around with the make-up of my demon army.
  Positive
Between its multiple interweaving systems, I expected something to get lost in Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor : Record Breaker.
  Negative
But that didn't happen.
  Neutral
Against all odds, these competing mechanics come together and form something that feels complete  a game where a player-driven story supports a brain-taxing strategic component supporting tense, classic JRPG battles.
  Negative
That these systems can coexist at all is a surprise; that they can feel right together is a feat worth celebrating.
  Positive
here.
  Neutral
