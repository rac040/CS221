If possible, the absence of famed Augusta National, which grabbed a lot of attention when EA Sports admitted that licensing agreement was over, is the least disappointing thing about this series' debut on the current console generation.
  Negative
But we can start with the pitifully small list of real-life courses that are available  eight, compared to  in its predecessor, and even more as downloadable content.
  Negative
There are four fantasy courses ranging from realistic to bizarre.
  Positive
You can't select individual holes, all par-s or all-par s on these courses to work on a specific section giving you trouble.
  Negative
It's either front nine, back nine or the whole round.
  Neutral
You can't play in any weather other than clear skies.
  Negative
You can't play popular variants like skins, Stableford scoring or best ball.
  Negative
It's just stroke or match play.
  Neutral
Tiger Woods PGA Tour .
  Neutral
You can create a golfer of either gender, but you can't give him or her anything other than one of  pre-set heads or three body types.
  Neutral
Of all the sports video games, golf is the one where everyone creates and plays as themselves, and this is an embarrassingly decade-old toolkit serving such a baseline expectation.
  Negative
You can't play any amateur career three were in Tiger Woods .
  Negative
You get one event on the minor-league Web.com Tour in which it is nearly impossible not to earn your PGA Tour card.
  Negative
You can't even  and for me, this was the most cynical omission  see the schedule in your player's career, probably because it would be an admission of how few events are on it.
  Negative
There are two major tournaments, the U.S. Open and the British Open, but you only get that presentation in your career.
  Negative
Can't select it in a round with friends.
  Positive
In a career event, you can't simulate rounds to play only the final round, as many did in the past.
  Negative
You are given something called quick rounds, which offer five or six key holes and simulate the rest, but you must play some holes in all four rounds.
  Negative
If a course doesn't appeal to you, the only option is to withdraw.
  Negative
Rory McIlroy PGA Tour seems to want to justify the absence of so many things longtime players have come to expect by virtue of its presentation and an evolution in its basic mechanics.
  Negative
The career mode does have a new progression system that deepens your player's package of abilities instead of forcing him or her to be pure power, pure accuracy or down the middle.
  Negative
Analog swing controls are improved by a shot-strength indicator that lets you watch your golfer in action, instead of a meter, and introduces some needed variability and difficulty in placing a shot.
  Negative
The game is still very forgiving, even for advanced users who turn off most of the package of swing assists and targeting help.
  Negative
The gameplay's real strength is in putting, which now presents a reasonable and understandable challenge without babying the player with artificial preview paths, or abandoning him or her to long stretches of trial and error.
  Negative
A dashed line now represents the ideal putt path, which you then try to match using your aim and your own feeling of how fast and steep the green and its break are.
  Positive
There is a very nice feeling of accomplishment on -foot putts, and longer distances make it more sensible to just lag it close and two-putt, which in turn makes an accurate approach shot even more important.
  Positive
Rory McIlroy PGA Tour also uses the new hardware to render the entire course instead of individual holes, which eliminates both the between-hole loads and the awkward broadcast graphics you saw while waiting.
  Negative
Shots that clip trees can now plow through the branches if they're going hard enough, where in the past they would fall straight down.
  Negative
The more powerful rendering does offer courses that play truer by keeping bad but not out-of-bounds shots still in play, and playing your ball where it lies, even if it's a real humdinger, rather than repositioning it automatically.
  Negative
The crowds and their chatter are a lot more lifelike and the broadcast commentary of Rich Lerner and Frank Nobilo, of the Golf Channel, is much more conversational than the wooden and overacted delivery of Jim Nantz.
  Negative
However, it is given to repetition, even as the two helpfully chime in with anecdotes while you're taking time to line up your shot.
  Neutral
The golfers have more detailed reactions and facial expressions, but they veer to the extreme.
  Neutral
Why is my golfer doing the running-man dance after hitting his tee shot  yards on the first hole of the second round?
  Negative
Online play is well-supported, with daily and weekly tournaments always available in addition to head-to-head matches against live opponents.
  Positive
There's an arcade suite called the Night Club Challenge in which players test their accuracy or driving distance on one of three neon-trimmed courses, equipping boosts to pull off stunt shots.
  Negative
It isn't as intriguing or deep as the historical or biographical modes its two predecessors offered, but it does offer more than  tricks to pull off, many tickling the common obsession with hitting a perfect shot.
  Positive
This is Rory McIlroy PGA Tour's overarching problem.
  Negative
It is a smooth-playing game of golf, which makes the inability to use its new gameplay on the old features fans loved even more regrettable.
  Negative
Rory McIlroy PGA Tour is the last sports video game to make the console generation transition.
  Negative
It's painful to see another game  particularly this series  so gutted of features.
  Negative
After hitting its drive very thin, Rory McIlroy PGA Tour is facing a long second, even third shot before it gets back to the kind of variety and value its three predecessors offered.
  Very negative
here.
  Neutral
has added enough courses and additional content that it meets the expectations of video game golf fans much more than it did at launch.
  Positive
It bears mentioning all of the extra content is free and available to all users.
  Positive
Another five real-world courses have been added, beefing up the career mode with extra events that are immediately added to a player's schedule.
  Negative
The major championships on the schedule still do not rotate their venues as they do in real life, but simply adding courses adds more value to the career mode.
  Negative
Multiplayer has added the option of playing a match simultaneously or in a traditional turn-based way.
  Positive
Gameplay variants like best ball, alternate shot, four ball and skins game also were added, giving multiplayer more options and depth.
  Positive
This shines more light on Rory McIlroy PGA Tour's best quality, which is a strong and true-playing game of golf where courses display distinct characteristics much more than its predecessors could.
  Positive
The options for creating and customizing your golfer remain disappointingly thin, and the commentary engine still serves up some amazingly out of place remarks even if Rich Lerner and Frank Nobilo are engaged, interesting and funny in what they say.
  Positive
And yes, it would have been better if Rory McIlroy PGA Tour had all of the content above at its July launch.
  Negative
But it has undeniably evolved into a better video game that merits a revision to our score.
  Positive
