Homestuck has attracted an air of confusion from many people.
  Negative
In , Andrew Hussie, who creates webcomics in point and click adventure format, began the journey known as Homestuck.
  Negative
This comic spanned across nine years,  pages, , words, dozens of Flash videos, several albums of officially-sanctioned fan-made music, a few games, four hours of film and more.
  Very positive
Though daunting, this multimedia project fostered a massive fandom-community, one as rabid for each new update as it was completely baffling to anyone outside of that culture.
  Negative
Hiveswap, a video game companion to Homestuck.
  Negative
The campaign garnered a massive .
  Neutral
million in funding, but it also received a healthy dose of skepticism  for its source material, for the seemingly outsized amount of funding compared to the tiny team handling it and for behind-the-scenes drama as fans waited for the game to arrive.
  Negative
Five years later, Hiveswaps first of four acts is finally here.
  Negative
So, as a fandom adage goes, let me tell you about Hiveswap.
  Positive
Hiveswap: Act One instantly launches you into a dilemma: Joey Claires house is being threatened by a mysterious surge of monsters, and she needs to help her brother, Jude Harley, get these vile creatures out and away.
  Negative
Every playable character is also a pre-teen deeply unprepared and unequipped to handle this threat.
  Negative
Not that it matters, as things take a twist when Joey activates a portal against the advice of her brother.
  Negative
Hiveswap isnt afraid of showing its heart and soul, and its a heart and soul that lovingly, chidingly side-eyes the past.
  Positive
Its not nostalgic exactly, but more appreciative of the culture that came before it.
  Neutral
Hiveswap: Act One is a warm, sing-song culmination of Hussies respect for point-and-click adventure games.
  Positive
This admiration shines through every step of the way, from the vibes of the opening animation to the cluttered, explorable backgrounds.
  Positive
doll of a dog that gave birth to a mystery number of puppies, and the game takes no shame in finding humor in it all.
  Negative
Relax, of course theres an X-Files reference in this game.
  Negative
Whether youre a long-time Homestuck fan or someone completely new to the confusing series, you probably share a single question: Whats in it for me?
  Negative
Non-Homestucks, well start with you.
  Positive
You dont need to understand Homestuck to get whats going on with Hiveswap.
  Negative
In fact, I would NOT recommend attempting to tackle it before playing.
  Negative
Given the absurd length of the entirety of Homestuck see above, youd be waiting around a long time before getting to the game.
  Negative
At worst, youll just miss out on a few inside jokes and clever references.
  Negative
Hiveswap will ease you into its universes quirks and subtleties with time.
  Positive
Now, Homestucks: If youre the type of fan that used to scream at a mundane image unveiling worlds of questions, youre going to scream again.
  Negative
A lot.
  Neutral
Make no mistake, Hiveswap takes place in the Homestuck universe, and the game rewards your attention to detail and dedication as a fan in countless ways.
  Positive
Knowledge of Homestuck isnt required to enjoy Hiveswap, but it makes the whole ordeal more exciting and intimate.
  Positive
Hiveswap isnt just an empty nostalgia trip though; that culture is merely a backdrop to the curious and detailed world that the game introduces.
  Negative
In the first half of Act One, youre given space to learn about cluttered and busy, yet precious mini-worlds built into what could otherwise be a mundane environment.
  Negative
In the house, the kids are a mess; their dads an adventurer whos never home, and their babysitters a horrible adult figure.
  Negative
But this bad lifestyle allows for their home to become a treasure trove literally and figuratively for players to explore.
  Negative
Hussie and his art team gorgeously give life to these settings, the characters and their unfortunate series of events through fantastic and varying cutscenes.
  Positive
The most vital cutscenes are fully animated by hand, while other moments in the game opt for expressive still shots.
  Positive
We even see the return of exaggerated two-frame animations, an Internet relic from both Homestuck and artimage boards.
  Negative
And even when the characters are drawn in a simplistic manner, the backgrounds are all stunning and well-detailed.
  Positive
In a break with point-and-click tradition, Hiveswap does feature some fights, but youre not really fighting anything.
  Negative
Called Strifes,, these segments act as just another type of puzzle.
  Negative
MAJOR epilepsy warning for the text in these, by the way.
  Negative
There are no health bars, no time limits and no way to lose, die or get sent back otherwise.
  Negative
Its a confrontation that takes some trial and error to get out of, but even if you pick the wrong items, the game treats you to unique, humorous interactions.
  Positive
Unfortunately, Strifes are where the user interface becomes an issue, as the game only puts mild effort into introducing how to find your way around.
  Very negative
Yes, Hiveswap is a relatively simple point-and-click, but its weighed down by a convoluted UI.
  Negative
For instance, the game gives you a few mild abilities, including tap dance and ballet dance among others.
  Positive
However, the acquisition of such abilities is extremely sudden, and there are specific and few uses thus far.
  Neutral
For all of the liveliness Hiveswap: Act One provides, the build I played was slightly glitchy.
  Positive
Things like the computer in Joeys room and the closet in the same space would provide odd prompts or even none at all.
  Negative
Clicking on one item glitched out my games visuals altogether, applying an effect overlay that affected every screen I went into even the main menu!
  Very positive
, and I had to reset.
  Negative
These game-altering bugs are an irritating note on an otherwise sweet game.
  Negative
With all said and done, the first act of Hiveswap took me a total of  minutes.
  Negative
If I were a slower reader, it would have likely amounted to at least two hours, which I think is a fair amount of time to spend with the game and its universe.
  Negative
For an introductory chapter of such a reading-heavy game, though, this felt like a perfect length.
  Positive
Hiveswap: Act One is brief, but I already have a lot of hope for the world and cast introduced here.
  Positive
And the music.
  Neutral
Oh god, yes, the music.
  Positive
Theres a lot to see, and anyone looking for a light-hearted adventure will have a great time.
  Positive
Despite its minor bugs and short length, both Homestuck devotees and those who never experienced the webcomic will find a fantastic, humorous introduction to this new pocket of an already-massive universe.
  Positive
