Metroid: Samus Returns is the remake no one was asking for.
  Negative
Super Metroid, Metroid : The Return of Samus was the first portable entry in the series.
  Negative
And it was a very solid, if safe, follow-up to the original game.
  Positive
Which is why no one was really demanding that it be remade.
  Negative
Metroid catalog.
  Neutral
Metroid: Samus Returns takes place immediately after the events of the first game.
  Negative
The Space Pirates, helmed by Mother Brain, have been defeated and their nefarious plans to use creatures called Metroids as an unlimited power source have been mostly thwarted.
  Very negative
Step two for the United Federation: Ensure that no one will ever be able to use these Metroids again.
  Negative
To that end, the organization sends resident bounty hunter badass Samus Aran to the home planet of the Metroids to straight-up murder every last one.
  Negative
Yes, its a classic story of heroic genocide!
  Positive
The story lines up pretty much exactly with that of the original Game Boy game, and is told with an animated cutscene at the outset, followed by zero dialogue throughout the rest of the game.
  Negative
If youve been put off by the remarkable amount of backstory in later Metroid entries, worry not.
  Negative
This is silent Samus at her very best.
  Very positive
The peaceful simplicity of the early Metroid games really works in their favor, and Samus Returns is no exception.
  Positive
Your quest of hunting down the Metroids predictably involves exploration, gear gathering and laser blasting.
  Negative
And even though the map is completely different and much larger than the one in the original Metroid , the objective is the same: Youll enter a new area and soon discover an altar that is asking for the DNA from X number of Metroids.
  Negative
Once you collect that Metroid DNA, you return to the altar; then, some poison goo lowers, and youre able to explore deeper into the planet, where more Metroids await.
  Negative
This sounds redundant on paper, but is far more interesting in practice.
  Negative
For one thing, the combat in Samus Returns is fantastic.
  Positive
D Metroid games have always struggled with control limitations.
  Negative
Simple problems, like only being able to fire in eight directions, made certain encounters frustrating.
  Negative
Even small, puny enemies were a pain because youd have to line Samus up perfectly to make a shot.
  Negative
Samus Returns, however, introduces the ability to aim in  degrees by holding the left trigger.
  Negative
Upon doing this, Samus gun will emit a laser pointer that turns red upon targeting an enemy, even if its slightly off-screen.
  Negative
This plays into puzzles as well, where missiles must be fired at a precise angle to access a collectible.
  Neutral
The other major improvement that Samus Returns brings to D Metroid: the ability to counterattack.
  Positive
Just about every enemy in the game can be countered by hitting the X button just as theyre attacking.
  Negative
Timing the counter will allow Samus to stun the enemy and finish it off with ease.
  Positive
The countering system works with -degree aiming, as it auto-locks onto the enemy you just countered so you dont have to stress about lining up your shot.
  Negative
This combination plays into fights with all enemies, big and small.
  Negative
For smaller foes, countering will let you one-shot them, progressing through areas without taking any damage so long as youre careful.
  Negative
Larger enemies can be countered as well.
  Neutral
In boss fights, countering often yields a cutscene with Samus flying through the air, landing on the head of the beastie before unleashing rockets aplenty.
  Negative
This makes the combat in Samus Returns feel more like an action game and less like a geometric problem.
  Negative
The combat is best on display during the games many boss fights.
  Very positive
Effectively there are more than  of them, as each Metroid you hunt down is like a miniboss in and of itself.
  Negative
Early Metroids are pretty simple, going down with a counterattack and a few rockets.
  Positive
But the Metroids quickly evolve, eventually presenting complex, multi-stage battles with challenging attack patterns to memorize.
  Negative
Toward the end of the game theres one fight in particular that is one of the most challenging in the history of Metroid, even on normal difficulty.
  Negative
And thanks to the combat enhancements, these battles never feel like a chore.
  Negative
Its the pinnacle of D combat in a franchise that has always suffered on that front.
  Negative
Visuals have never been an area where Metroid has struggled, though.
  Negative
Each entry has pushed its hardware to the limits, and Samus Returns continues that tradition.
  Negative
The games graphics are in full D, albeit locked to a side-scrolling perspective, and the level of detail in each of the environments is remarkable.
  Very positive
The Metroid home planet is quite varied, from plant-ridden caves to lava pools to technological wonders deep beneath the surface.
  Negative
If you can stomach the DSs D effects, theyre a serious treat here.
  Positive
The sense of depth in these environments is perfect.
  Positive
Even on older DS handhelds, the level of detail pours through the screen in buckets.
  Negative
To call Metroid: Samus Returns a remake feels unfair.
  Negative
Remakes are old games with new coats of paint: an upgrade in resolution here, reworked artwork there.
  Positive
Samus Returns is far more than that.
  Neutral
Its a top-to-bottom reimagining, bringing the bones of a game thats over  years old into the modern era with fantastic results.
  Positive
