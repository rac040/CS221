Persona : Dancing All Night is not, as I worried, blood squeezed from a stone, and that's the first of its many surprises.
  Negative
Here's another: From start to finish, Persona : Dancing All Night nails the feel of classic PSOne-era rhythm games.
  Positive
It doesn't just emulate the spirit of DanceDanceRevolution and Bust a Groove, it improves on that spirit.
  Positive
Perhaps its biggest surprise is this: Persona  is one of my favorite games and, by unlikely extension, game franchises ever, but I still think I'd get a lot out of by Persona : Dancing All Night without that history.
  Positive
The beauty of Persona : Dancing All Night's choreographic gameplay lies in its simplicity.
  Positive
Notes fly out of the center of the screen toward six corresponding inputs: up, left and down on your left thumb, and Triangle, Circle and Cross on your right.
  Negative
You hit them in time with the music, sometimes hitting two simultaneously, sometimes holding them in.
  Negative
You can also flick either thumbstick in time with rings that expand on-screen, although this additional input layer is totally optional  you could skip them all and not fail out of a song.
  Negative
It's perhaps a little too accessible at first; as is the case with a lot of rhythm games, Persona : Dancing All Night's core gameplay just feels better when it's at its most challenging.
  Negative
Each new difficulty setting introduces new mechanics, and further punishes the slightest slip-ups during a dance.
  Negative
It can be brutal in that latter regard  I've failed entire performances after missing the last few notes in a song, although it was never frustrating enough to drive me away entirely.
  Negative
That's because of Persona : Dancing All Night's most brilliant innovation: It's bolstered by a suite of unlockable items that allow you to modify the difficulty of each song in dozens of little ways.
  Positive
Items can be switched on before a song to, for example, reduce the blow of missed notes, or keep barely-missed notes from breaking your combo, at the cost of some of your final score and earnings.
  Negative
On the inverse, special modifiers can make the track more difficult, drastically increasing the speed of notes or even rendering all the notes invisible, all the while dramatically increasing your haul should you succeed.
  Negative
It's a genius, totally modular system that lets you find the settings you prefer.
  Positive
I've been playing the game's unlockable hardest difficulty with a few forgiving modifiers turned on, giving me the rush of playing at lightspeed without the fear of instant failure should I miss a couple of beats.
  Negative
Using items, you can find your own personal difficulty threshold, which will inevitably, satisfyingly increase the more you play.
  Positive
Even without its license, Persona : Dancing All Night has a genuinely fun rhythm game design.
  Positive
However, an understanding of Persona  certainly helps make heads or tails of Dancing All Night's convoluted premise  which is, admittedly, pure fan service.
  Neutral
But man is it good fan service.
  Positive
The original members of the Investigation Team, fresh off the case of the Inaba serial killer, have been recruited by pop idol member Rise to perform as backup dancers in her comeback show.
  Negative
During their intensive dance training, other idols scheduled to perform are abducted to the Shadow World.
  Negative
In order to save them, our heroes must  brace yourselves  dance away the inhibitions of hostile, shadowy spectators while unraveling the identity of their abductor.
  Negative
Yes, it's weird, and on paper, the setup bends over backwards to justify why these former dungeon crawlers are dancing all of a sudden.
  Negative
But the premise, as silly as it may be, is painstakingly developed over hours of visual novel-style cutscenes told from multiple, cleverly overlapped perspectives.
  Negative
If you know the franchise, it's probably no surprise that the strength of Persona : Dancing All Night's story mode are the Investigation Team themselves.
  Negative
They're spectacular characters, with depth far beyond most of the comparatively single-faceted newcomers.
  Positive
The relationships between Yu, Yukiko, Chie, Yosuke and the rest aren't explored quite as deeply as the original RPG  it'd need to run for a few dozen more hours to attempt that  but each one of them has some satisfying beats.
  Negative
Speaking of satisfying beats, Persona  Dancing All Night's soundtrack is certifiably dope, regardless of your familiarity with the source material.
  Positive
Most of the tracks have been expertly remixed, so much so that the multiple remixes of the same tracks can stand on their own.
  Positive
Dancing All Night has a jukebox mode, and I'm not ashamed to admit that I've used it more than once.
  Negative
Though the game's strong suit are its characters, they can be a bit chatty at inopportune times.
  Negative
Characters will talk to each other during songs, sometimes repeating a line multiple times in a single performance.
  Positive
One character actually does a -count during a song, and not to the beat of the music.
  Negative
Every button prompt and scratch makes a customizable noise, too, which kind of ruins the song playing underneath.
  Negative
All of that can and absolutely should be turned off as soon as possible.
  Positive
One frustrating setting you cannot tweak is how poorly the online leaderboards are integrated into the game.
  Very negative
They're squirreled away under several layers of submenus, far under a "Collection" category where it doesn't really belong.
  Negative
Checking your scores against the world's is clunky every single time, and they're so deeply buried, you could be forgiven for not knowing there were online leaderboards in Persona : Dancing All Night at all.
  Very negative
There are touches of flawed execution in Persona : Dancing All Night, but they do little to upset what is otherwise a spectacular rhythm game.
  Positive
Genuine strokes of genius can be found in its modifiable gameplay and superb soundtrack, and they're compelling enough to keep the game from solely relying on its buckets of patented Persona charm.
  Positive
