Yes, it's full of nausea and loops and screaming  everything you'd expect in that regard from a game with rollercoasters in it.
  Negative
Like much of the inspiration behind it, you can build new coasters to your heart's content.
  Positive
I would love to tell you about the things ScreamRide gets right about coaster construction, and I will!
  Positive
But developer Frontier Developments leverages an incredible physics and destruction engine to make it more and, sometimes, less than the tycoon-style games of yesterday.
  Negative
Missing completely from ScreamRide is a key element of the RollerCoaster Tycoon games that serve as its spiritual forebears  park management.
  Negative
There's no long game to ScreamRide.
  Negative
It's all about the rides themselves, and the engine and the funny things you can do with it.
  Positive
There's no empire to build, no legacy to create.
  Negative
ScreamRide is instead several games, or rather, pieces of games.
  Negative
There's ScreamRider, an arcade-style racer that sends you rocketing along a series of coaster tracks.
  Positive
It reminds me most of -bit era games like Uniracers.
  Neutral
It's not about steering, so much as it is controlled, applied velocity  take a turn too fast and you might lose a passenger or two which is funny just about every time it happens, but can hurt your score, or cause unexpected damage elsewhere, and stay unstable for too long and you might derail entirely.
  Very negative
Then there's Demolition Expert.
  Neutral
While still deeply rooted in arcade mechanics of high score chases and competition with your friends list, Demolition Expert instead gives you a collection of buildings to destroy with a variety of cabins, which, yes, do in fact have people inside.
  Negative
Then there's the Engineer campaign, which gives you a series of challenges requiring you to complete rollercoaster rides with specific requirements and limited resources.
  Neutral
Each mode is dramatically different in its goals, enough so that at first it's a little disorienting that they're all together in the one package.
  Positive
But I found common threads before long.
  Positive
ScreamRider is where the game adds new mechanics and machinery to your rollercoaster vocabulary.
  Positive
Engineer is where you use those tools to solve problems, and Demolition Expert ... OK, that just seems like the cool toy that someone at Frontier couldn't help but include in the game.
  Negative
I can't blame them.
  Neutral
While every mode in ScreamRide has something worth saying, Demolition Expert is the one that speaks the most clearly, because it's doing it with explosions.
  Positive
ScreamRide has the most impressive environmental destruction I think I've ever seen in a game, and it does it all on the fly, dynamically.
  Positive
Buildings don't fall over, they collapse, often with explosive force and the assistance of several explosions.
  Negative
If debris is flying fast enough, it can in turn cause catastrophic damage that daisy-chains one fallen structure into several.
  Negative
Frontier pairs this impressive tech with some excellent puzzle design that channels pachinko-style logic  "if I can bounce this off that at just the right angle I can bring down this thing on top of that thing" and so on.
  Neutral
Demolition Expert doesn't seem to have right answers, exactly.
  Negative
Instead, some strategies fail, some things work, and some things work much better.
  Negative
I felt clever with my initial strategies in later levels but by the time I was done, I had always found a more sophisticated, higher-scoring way of achieving the same results.
  Positive
It's excellent and casually approachable in some very smart ways.
  Very positive
That approachability carries over to the Engineer challenges, which at first seem a little daunting.
  Negative
But Frontier scales these levels appropriately, starting simple with just a few kinds of pieces and introduces new tools over time, like corkscrews, loops and more.
  Positive
I never felt like I was being given a piece that felt alien to my experience with ScreamRide at the time, though the challenges of Engineer stages ramp up considerably.
  Negative
Engineer's feedback system keeps ScreamRide feeling honest, not cheap.
  Positive
Any time you're ready, you can hit down on the D-pad to send unsuspecting park visitors through your potentially unfinished ride to see exactly how it works.
  Negative
As the cars make their way down the track, ScreamRide notes events like nausea, high G-forces and lateral pressure on the riders that can cause ejections.
  Negative
It even notes high and low intensity levels, which will help tailor the ride to the challenges ScreamRide is giving you.
  Very positive
Most importantly, you can end the test run at any time, and all of these notes will appear on your track, tagged exactly where each event happened.
  Negative
This allowed me to make proper tweaks to get my coaster exactly where I wanted it.
  Negative
I never felt lost trying to satisfy Frontier's determined rule set for each level, but I also felt plenty of space to experiment and go for higher scores than my friends' on the same level.
  Positive
The same arcade sensibility is present throughout each campaign, and for me, it was a compelling factor in getting me to replay levels again and again until I got the score I wanted.
  Negative
For fans of the Rollercoaster Tycoon series, though, the most important inclusion will likely be the track creation tool, which allows you to make any of the three kinds of levels from the campaign.
  Positive
Given how robust the creation system is, this will probably be pushed into some extreme directions.
  Negative
There's a full-fledged world creation engine at play, from basic geography of stages and tile types to the full collection of coaster creation and also all the tools you need to build demolition stages.
  Negative
In truth, this is where ScreamRide feels the least approachable.
  Negative
There's an overwhelming amount of options available at any given moment.
  Positive
Many pieces and environment types are tied to progress in the game's campaigns, and if you jump into the sandbox afterward, you could spend half an hour going through everything before you place your first piece.
  Negative
It also exacerbates the finicky camera that is less of an issue elsewhere.
  Negative
And, while you can share your levels online with other players, creating your own custom challenges for your tracks, the process to do so feels bureaucratically weighted down with a checklist of tasks to complete before you can do so.
  Negative
This is indicative of a slight sensation of aimlessness that can fall over ScreamRide at times.
  Negative
It's a collection of parts that share some very impressive technology and rollercoasters, and that doesn't always feel like the strongest glue.
  Positive
A unifying, bizarre sense of humor helps a little and adds a playfully sadistic sense of humor to the whole thing.
  Negative
The in-game PA system also suggests forcefully that ScreamRide's world has a history, and, in fact, might be part of something larger and more conventionally sci-fi.
  Positive
The absence of the obsessive management elements that have defined the coaster genre for more than a decade may alienate some fans longing for a return to that kind of form.
  Negative
But behind all that is a game that succeeds really well at the game part, using next-gen tech for something other than a flashier presentation.
  Positive
The result is a little uneven, but ScreamRide still ends up as one of the first great surprises of .
  Positive
here.
  Neutral
