EA Sports UFC : relentlessly, on top of the other guy, raining down fists like Ralphie on the bully from A Christmas Story.
  Negative
Over the past eight years, mixed martial arts video games have tended to baffle me as I struggled to remember the discrete command inputs and tactics in the sport's three different phases of standing up, the "clinch" and then down on the mat.
  Negative
UFC  comes the closest of any in allowing me to win, credibly, with what I'm good at, and in helping me minimize or hide my shortcomings.
  Positive
The result in UFC  is something that, in my hands at least, looks like a real fight instead of a series of spammed inputs from my panicky hands.
  Negative
My bouts unfold with MMA's distinctive tension, followed by a burst of scream-at-the-TV action.
  Positive
Even the best fighters are still in perpetual danger, and not just from flash knockouts, which have lost some of their randomness.
  Negative
A lucky punch can cascade into all sorts of bad outcomes if you get careless, as it should.
  Negative
To unlock this action, one must understand who they are as a fighter.
  Negative
EA Sports UFC  doesn't have much of a tutorial, but it does feature a series of skill challenges that are a must for any newcomer or intimidated novice.
  Negative
You're going to have to do a little bit of everything in MMA at some point, but you have to be honest about what you're not good at so you can build a fighter with what you are.
  Neutral
In my case, I found that I was really good at takedowns and very good at avoiding them, and that I really enjoyed hitting guys in the face.
  Very positive
A ground-and-pounder may sound more like a clich than a breakthrough for those more experienced with MMA games, but I was surprised at how effective I was in picking a plan and sticking to it.
  Negative
I felt like, if I was better at submissions, kickboxing and prolonged work in the clinch, the game would have been fine letting me win that way, too.
  Negative
As a scared rookie around my fifth fight, deliberately taking on a tougher opponent fighting a muay thai style, I beat his ass inside of the first minute when I wobbled him with an uppercut, providing all the opening I needed to get him to the ground and thrash him.
  Negative
That was just as authentic as the next fight, where I submitted in the second round.
  Negative
EA Sports UFC  features a significant new assist to help players manage the grappling system.
  Positive
When you're clinched, a joystick map appears, indicating the available holds and stances you can transition to.
  Negative
It's then a matter of pushing the stick in that direction and holding it there for a period of time to complete the move.
  Negative
Naturally, this is affected by the countermoves the AI or other player will use to avoid the hold and counter-countermoves you can attempt to keep it going, as well as ratings and fighter stamina.
  Negative
But I'm no longer clueless about what constitutes a major or a minor transition, which one is appropriate in the situation, or how to execute it on the sticks.
  Negative
It's also a lot less panic-inducing when someone puts me on the ground and transitions to a dominant position; I feel like I at least know my escape route, even if I might be battered to the point that I can't make it.
  Very negative
The one-move transitions, holds and takedowns the stick modified with a trigger press make UFC  much more accessible than its predecessor.
  Positive
The drawback, however, is that I spent a lot of time looking at that on-screen indicator instead of the rest of the game, and UFC  is gorgeous.
  Positive
This was a selling point of its  predecessor, but there's still recognizable polish to UFC 's visuals.
  Positive
Animations are more lifelike and really sell the moves, without the kind of jerkiness that makes combat sports characters seem robotic.
  Positive
Moreover, this is useful information  information I missed while staring at the transition interface  because the momentary stumbles and slips are an opportunity for the hawk-eyed fighter.
  Negative
Punches, kicks and knockouts arrive with palpable force and sound to match, and as a fight wears on, both combatants can look downright hideous.
  Negative
Still, some strike controls remain as complicated as ever, leaving me pretzel-fingered as I attempted some of the moves that distinguish MMA.
  Negative
More than a few need a bumper, a left-stick motion and a face button press, and the volume of different options made it hard for me to commit more than one to memory.
  Very negative
Parrying a strike is difficult, perhaps necessarily so, but because high and low blocks are separated, it can require hovering fingers above both the right bumper and trigger  an unnatural, uncomfortable position.
  Negative
In an MMA game I want to be able to instinctively do, like, MMA things  like a superman punch or a dramatic roundhouse kick.
  Negative
But in the higher-difficulty strike drills, where I struggled to earn a D grade with jumping knees or spinning back fists, it became clear that putting my knuckles in the other guy's grill, a lot, was job one.
  Negative
The submission minigame also remains as inscrutable as ever unless you're willing to put in a ton of frustrating practice, despite a new coat of paint.
  Negative
In the first EA Sports UFC, the "stages" of a submission hold were all of an equivalent length, and every submission comprised five stages.
  Negative
UFC  tries to add variety to this by giving some submissions fewer stages, and by adding a left-stick prompt for the attacker, which if keyed in time will advance the submission to the next stage.
  Negative
This isn't as simple as it sounds.
  Negative
As in the first UFC, attacker and defender are still scooting around a four-direction map with their right sticks, trying to fill up a quadrant or block it.
  Negative
Also, any early or late left-stick press results in an instant escape for the defender, meaning it's better sometimes to not answer that prompt and continue focusing on thwarting your opponent's escape.
  Negative
I don't think I completed a single submission in the tutorial, and in my fight career I focused on avoiding rather than applying submission holds, which is a lot easier, almost unfairly so.
  Negative
It strips out a lot of value to have such a distinguishing feature of MMA inaccessible to all but the most committed practitioners.
  Negative
Online play offers a standard menu of options, including a "rivalries" wrapper that tracks your stats against fighters you challenge from your friends list, and a ranked championship series running on a promotionrelegation system similar to online leagues in FIFA.
  Negative
What I played was smooth enough that I could fight as naturally as I did versus the computer offline, but it bears mentioning that online multiplayer has been on less than a day, and only on Xbox One.
  Negative
We will revisit this review if additional time with online multiplayer affects our opinion.
  Negative
The career mode doesn't have a lot of trimmings, but you can now create a woman and take her through a career as robust as the men's division  a noteworthy if overdue addition.
  Neutral
Still, it's going to be up to the player to concoct any real narrative for themselves if they want to feel like a big-time fighter, as there isn't much in the presentation that acknowledges your progress, outside of winning a title.
  Negative
The between-bouts portion of the career mode adds a wrinkle to the training exercises, in that a fighter can hurt himself or herself if they attempt a higher-difficulty drill, particularly if it's in an unfamiliar discipline.
  Negative
There's also a wear-and-tear factor to the fights themselves; you might take a hell of a beating and still win, but that's going to shorten your career.
  Negative
It's a competent package that keeps the mode from being just a series of fights strung together, but not by much.
  Positive
UFC  also adds its own take on Ultimate Team, the microtransaction-driven staple of team titles like Madden and FIFA, and Knockout Mode, which became quite a guilty pleasure.
  Negative
Knockout Mode is more for casual play and better with a couch companion, but you can also whale on the CPU and get right to the point of a fight game, which is a KO.
  Positive
In the mode, players are reduced to hit points and strikes take one off, so when a fighter is out of hit points, he drops to the canvas like a -pound bag of puppy chow.
  Negative
I found it useful as sparring practice in ways the more structured striking drills aren't, without going through an entire match that might involve grappling and other things I don't want to do.
  Negative
Ultimate Team is essentially a career mode with online multiplayer, leaderboards and championships.
  Negative
Players create a stable of five fighters, either gender, and the card-collecting concept comes in to give them fighting moves, styles and other upgrades that you can distribute among them.
  Negative
Yes, there's the option to just buy something for real money rather than earn the virtual dough needed.
  Negative
Where I found Ultimate Team useful was in getting me to play outside of the familiar style of my career fighter, because sometimes I'd get a great card for something like a judo style.
  Negative
You can earn the virtual currency that buys these cards by playing the mode a lot, but of course EA Sports is hoping people also splurge on something they want right now, for real money.
  Negative
It's easier to forgive EA Sports UFC 's shortcomings when the game's fight action is solid, understandable and enjoyable.
  Positive
Even if some of its components are more difficult than others, the streamlining and simplification of takedowns and transitions is a pivotal change that frees the game without making it pointlessly easy.
  Negative
It would be nice to see this philosophy applied to submissions and dazzling attacks, but my victories in UFC  still felt honest and earned, and I came away feeling a mental connection to the fighter I would most want to be.
  Positive
here.
  Neutral
