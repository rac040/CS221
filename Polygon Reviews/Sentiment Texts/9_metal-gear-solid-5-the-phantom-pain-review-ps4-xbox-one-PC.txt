It's fitting that one of the recurring themes of Metal Gear Solid : The Phantom Pain is about the loss of a part of your being.
  Negative
Phantom limb pain is the sensation that flesh once a part of your body can still be felt, can cause you suffering, after it's gone.
  Negative
Series creator Hideo Kojima has been making Metal Gear games with publisher Konami for close to  years, creating sequels and prequels that bounce back and forth between the future and the past of a labyrinthine fictional world of spies, cold wars and walking nuclear weapons bearing the series' name.
  Negative
The Phantom Pain, an open-world stealth game about the adventures of Big Boss, also known as Snake, seems to be his unexpected swan song.
  Negative
The Phantom Pain closes the loop on the three decade-long Metal Gear saga and the result, warts and all, turns out to be one of the best entries in the series.
  Positive
Set between the events of 's Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker and the original Metal Gear, the  stealth game progenitor in which Big Boss plays the role of chief antagonist, The Phantom Pain serves as a sort of "missing link" between those two games, an opportunity to learn how Big Boss transformed from a sympathetic hero to an iconic villain.
  Negative
Players who haven't touched last year's Metal Gear Solid : Ground Zeroes will find themselves thrust into a conflict that, without similar knowledge of previous Big Boss-starring games Metal Gear Solid  and Peace Walker, can be pretty confusing.
  Negative
The Phantom Pain doesn't waste much time getting players up to speed, but tells them that they're on a mission of revenge, a mission to rebuild Big Boss' once-thriving private army.
  Negative
In an effort to grow that force, named Diamond Dogs, and expand the group's stronghold, Mother Base, Big Boss takes on paid mercenary missions to fund his private military group.
  Negative
These missions include exfiltrating prisoners; eliminating military commanders either through assassination or kidnapping; dismantling the infrastructure of occupying forces and more.
  Negative
Big Boss has a wealth of weapons, tools and tactics at his disposal in stealth and combat situations.
  Negative
He can sneak in quietly, knocking out foes with tranquilizer darts or go on a murderous rampage, unleashing air strikes and sniper fire at bases until everyone stationed there is dead.
  Negative
I found both tactical options to be valid in The Phantom Pain, sometimes depending on the mission at hand, though taking a stealthier approach I found paid dividends over time.
  Negative
As a stealth game pacifist, I preferred to keep my kill count low, though I rarely flinched when required to shoot some poor young soldier in the face.
  Negative
Occasionally, I felt better about just shooting them in the knees to disable them, then hoping that they'd survive a trip back to Mother Base.
  Negative
One of the most effective tools in Big Boss' bag of tricks is his set of binoculars.
  Positive
As in the game's prologue, Metal Gear Solid : Ground Zeroes, observation of the battlefield is vital to your success in The Phantom Pain; Big Boss can mark enemies and track their location with a godlike clairvoyance.
  Negative
Unmarked enemies can often surprise you and ruin your perfect stealth streak, but I prefer it to the radar system and vision cones of Metal Gear Solids past.
  Positive
The second best piece of tech in the game  certainly the most fun to use  is the Fulton surface-to-air recovery system.
  Very positive
It lets Big Boss attach a balloon to enemy soldiers, trucks, tanks, weapon emplacements, even wild animals, then extract them back to Mother Base via aircraft, where they'll become part of the Diamond Dogs army.
  Negative
Using the Fulton system to its fullest is one of The Phantom Pain's most enjoyable challenges: Successfully extracting, rather than killing, high-ranking commanders and recruiting them into your army are some of the game's best moments.
  Very positive
It's gratifying to completely clear out an enemy outpost and transport everything safely back to Mother Base, thereby increasing the power of your own private military force.
  Negative
Managing Mother Base is one of The Phantom Pain's surprising highlights.
  Positive
As you bring in new recruits to Diamond Dogs, you'll assign them to various teams Combat, Ramp;D, Intel, etc., capitalizing on their specialized skills to develop new technologies for Big Boss to use on missions.
  Negative
There's a long list of research upgrades and contract missions you can assign staff to, meaning there's always something new and interesting to do from the Mother Base menu.
  Positive
Visiting the base in person, however, isn't very rewarding.
  Negative
You're required to return to Diamond Dogs headquarters often, sometimes for narrative reasons but also to keep staff morale high and give Big Boss the occasional shower, lest his performance in the field suffer.
  Negative
But Mother Base feels empty and sterile.
  Negative
Once you're there, there's just not enough to do.
  Negative
The number of firearms, explosives and other tools that Mother Base can research for Big Boss to use in the field is staggering.
  Negative
Access to those tools and a vast number of upgrades for each unlocks over time as players develop Mother Base and recruit a long list of specialists hidden throughout missions.
  Negative
Big Boss also gains a handful of allies, called buddies in the game, who can be deployed to aid him on missions.
  Negative
The first, named D-Horse, acts as little more than a vehicle to transport Big Boss from points A to B to C. Two other buddies, DD the dog and Quiet the bikini-clad, ripped fishnets-wearing sniper, however, drastically alter how one plays The Phantom Pain.
  Negative
Who you choose to deploy with depends on how you prefer to approach The Phantom Pain's missions.
  Neutral
DD serves as a helpful spotter in operations, sniffing out threats on the battlefield, marking them and thereby extending the range of Big Boss' situational awareness, though he's not especially useful in combat situations.
  Negative
He's like the auto-pilot version of The Phantom Pain's marking system and I found his contribution invaluable during many missions.
  Positive
You can also pet DD, by far The Phantom Pain's greatest contextual button prompt.
  Positive
FOB multiplayer consists of one-on-one invasions, in which a player can attack your Mother Base, or vice versa, in an attempt to steal away personnel and resources.
  Negative
Players will receive warnings that their base is being invaded, at which point they can choose whether or not they want to personally defend their headquarters, or let the Diamond Dogs back at home fend off the attacker.
  Negative
FOB is optional; players are given the choice to participate in the mode by explicitly building a Forward Operating Base.
  Negative
For me, this happened about halfway through my playtime.
  Negative
Building a FOB grants access to additional combat deployment missions, but it doesn't appear critical to The Phantom Pain's gameplay.
  Negative
We've only spent a few minutes with FOB prior to release and in a controlled environment.
  Negative
We'll revisit FOB when The Phantom Pain is released and we have a chance to play on live servers.
  Negative
Metal Gear Online isn't scheduled to go live until October on consoles, and early next year on PC.
  Negative
We'll revisit that too when MGO becomes available.
  Negative
Neither mode has been factored into this review.
  Negative
Quiet is also incredibly useful in missions, dispatching foes to ensure Big Boss doesn't get caught or sowing mayhem to distract enemies.
  Neutral
She's also central to the plot of The Phantom Pain, more so than any other "buddy."
  Positive
The game's explanation for Quiet's mute, nearly-naked presence is inextricably tied to the game's convoluted story, and while her silence makes sense, her sexualized appearance doesn't feel earned.
  Negative
I couldn't shake the feeling that her visual design came first, with the game's ridiculous justification for her barely-there outfit coming second.
  Negative
Quiet is treated differently than other characters by the direction of the game's camera, too.
  Neutral
During cutscenes, the camera sometimes pauses for a beat to focus  or straight up lingers  on Quiet's breasts.
  Neutral
In one shot, we see it slide down the barrel of her sniper rifle, take measure of her cleavage before slowly rising up to her face.
  Negative
The camera framing puts her exposed body on display unnecessarily more often than not, whether we're looking down at Quiet's chest or gazing up at her bottom.
  Negative
Worse, a game event that hints at her being sexually assaulted felt more like a hamfisted plan to remove Quiet's pants just before she metes out gory revenge against her attackers.
  Negative
The Phantom Pain treats its few other female characters in a similar way, zeroing in on their jiggling breasts and panning across their asses in a silly, oversexualized way.
  Negative
It's distracting.
  Negative
It's annoying.
  Negative
It's tiresome.
  Negative
Those sins only serve to detract from The Phantom Pain's finely tuned stealth-based gameplay.
  Negative
Each mission, and there are dozens, plays like a polished puzzle box nestled in a vast open-world.
  Negative
Solving that puzzle with the breadth of Big Boss' tools, experimenting with new weapons and technology that evolve over time, can be tense, thrilling and so rewarding.
  Positive
The game adapts to Big Boss' changing toolbox of espionage tactics, however, and as you eventually come face-to-face with heavily armored soldiers, you'll find that your tranquilizer gun isn't nearly as effective as it was in the early portion of the game.
  Very negative
But The Phantom Pain offers a counter-strategy to that counter-strategy.
  Positive
Some of the game's deployment operations, in which you can send Diamond Dogs off on remote missions, are designed to intercept enemy shipments of, say, helmets and riot armor  the kind of stuff that neuters your tranq darts and headshots.
  Very negative
It's just one example of the interlocking systems and incredibly fine details that makes The Phantom Pain so impressive.
  Very positive
While The Phantom Pain excels on its stealthy side, some of the action-heavy set pieces  intense battles against the super-powered, supernatural Skulls soldiers and mechanized forces  are often more frustrating than they are fun.
  Negative
But I was able to hand over responsibility for killing Skulls and Metal Gear Sahelanthropus to support helicopters, Quiet and aerial bombardment runs, at least.
  Negative
Elsewhere, The Phantom Pain's story is captivating, oftentimes a bit messy  and almost wholly absent for a good portion of the early game.
  Positive
After an extended, surreal intro-cum-tutorial mission, the game just meanders for a few hours as Big Boss takes on odd jobs.
  Negative
Once the story does get going, its narrative is doled out in nicely shot cutscenes that thankfully never border on the ridiculously lengthy.
  Negative
The rest is fleshed out through cassette tapes, primarily conversations between Big Boss, Revolver Ocelot and Kaz Miller.
  Negative
Curiously and suspiciously, Big Boss, voiced by Keifer Sutherland, has very little to say during the course of the game.
  Negative
He'll often stand there oddly silent as Ocelot, Miller and other supporting characters regale him with dialogue you'd expect at least some sort of response to.
  Negative
There's no denying that Kojima has a vision, a singular style that touches every facet of The Phantom Pain.
  Positive
Missions begin and end with credits that name the supporting players and the Kojima Productions employees responsible for writing or designing each chapter.
  Negative
I estimate I was told no less than  times that The Phantom Pain was directed and produced by Kojima.
  Negative
It's a charming design quirk that regularly reminds you of the people who crafted this bold, weird, impressive game.
  Very positive
And if this is where Kojima does finally leave the series he created, it will be a bittersweet send-off, both for Big Boss and one of gaming's most intriguing auteurs.
  Positive
Metal Gear Solid : The Phantom Pain was reviewed on retail PS code at Konami's Los Angeles studio over the course of four days with equal time spent playing that retail copy at home.
  Negative
You can find additional information about Polygon's ethics policy here.
  Neutral
Over the past weeks, we've spent more time with The Phantom Pain's online features: Forward Operating Bases and Metal Gear Online, the competitive multiplayer mode that launched on consoles about a month after the game shipped.
  Negative
While both modes add a bit more variety to Metal Gear Solid 's comprehensive package, neither feature matches the quality or engrossing replayability of The Phantom Pain's campaign.
  Negative
Once players reach a certain point in the campaign  they'll be deep into The Phantom Pain by this point  they'll have the option to build a Forward Operating Base.
  Negative
As with their main headquarters, Mother Base, players can build out their FOB with new platforms and station additional staff members there.
  Negative
The main benefit for doing so is an increase in resources and a boost in researching new weapons and technology.
  Positive
FOBs come with a catch, though: Other players can invade your FOB and steal resources and personnel.
  Negative
Establishing an FOB unlocks a deeper level of base management that's thrilling at times and tedious at others.
  Negative
Invading other bases can be a lot of fun; successfully sneaking your way through another player's defenses and plundering their supplies is initially as entertaining as some of the game's single-player campaign missions.
  Positive
If you're online when another player invades your own FOB, you have the option of letting your soldiers and other security measures fend off an attacker or taking matters into your own hands, and intervening personally.
  Negative
Initially, this can be exciting, but I found myself increasingly more annoyed than entertained as my FOB was invaded; the hassle of being interrupted and potentially losing hard-earned resources just didn't feel worth the benefit of establishing an FOB.
  Negative
Having an FOB also gives players access to PF Battles  a league-based player-versus-player contest that mostly happens in the background  that encourage players to build up their security team and automated FOB defenses.
  Negative
The game will match you up with another player and assess your defensive capabilities.
  Positive
Are yours better?
  Neutral
Congratulations, you get some points that can then be spent on more resources and personnel.
  Negative
Your first FOB in The Phantom Pain is free.
  Neutral
But if players want to add additional bases, thereby adding more resources and speeding up research production, they'll have to spend an in-game currency called Mother Base coins.
  Negative
Konami is doling out a small amount of coins as part of daily rewards for logging in and playing the game.
  Negative
Players also have the option to spend real-world money to acquire MB coins.
  Negative
Pay more real money, get more in-game rewards.
  Negative
expected to launch January .
  Neutral
Metal Gear Online, a separate game mode accessible from the The Phantom Pain's main menu, consists of three competitive game types: Bounty Hunter, Cloak and Dagger, and Comms Control.
  Negative
Bounty Hunter is the closest thing that The Phantom Pain has to a team deathmatch mode; each team has a set number of tickets, with the goal being to eliminate the enemy team's stock of tickets.
  Negative
Bounty Hunter's interesting twist is how it translates the game's Fulton system to scoring.
  Negative
Players who rack up kills in Bounty Hunter will be marked with bounties; the higher your bounty, the greater risk you are to your own team.
  Negative
Knock out and Fulton a player with a bounty and you'll add their bounty score to your team's supply of tickets.
  Positive
That rule almost makes Bounty Hunter enjoyable, thanks to the rare rush that comes with successfully KOing another player and Fultoning them off the battlefield.
  Positive
But more often than not, Bounty Hunter devolves into a merely capable team deathmatch mode, where the stealth-based focus of Metal Gear Solid simply doesn't translate well.
  Negative
Cloak and Dagger, however, smartly capitalizes on Metal Gear's stealth strengths.
  Negative
In this team-based mode, one side is outfitted with nonlethal weapons and active camouflage that makes them nigh-invisible.
  Negative
The other side is armed with lethal weapons and is tasked with guarding a pair of data discs.
  Negative
Players switch roles mid-match.
  Neutral
It's essentially capture the flag, Metal Gear style, and the smartest mode in Metal Gear Online.
  Negative
Comms Control sees players attempting to control a trio of capture points.
  Negative
It's Metal Gear Online's least essential mode.
  Negative
shuttering of Konami's Los Angeles studio, the team responsible for the creation of Metal Gear Online, the mode does not have a bright long-term future.
  Negative
Neither FOBs nor Metal Gear Online swayed our overall enjoyment of Metal Gear Solid : The Phantom Pain  which excels on the strengths of its robust single-player campaign  meaningfully for the better or worse.
  Negative
Both are adequate additions to an already impressive core.
  Positive
After an initial shaky launch, the game's online features seem stable.
  Negative
As such, we're comfortable removing the provisional status from this review.
  Positive
