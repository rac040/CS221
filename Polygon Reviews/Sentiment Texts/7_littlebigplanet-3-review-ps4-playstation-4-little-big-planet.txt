LittleBigPlanet games  namely that the series has never had particularly great platforming.
  Neutral
By introducing three new character types with unique movement physics, new developer Sumo Digital has created a clever way to please everyone.
  Positive
at E , it was sold on the idea of multiple new playable characters working in unison.
  Neutral
Technically, this happens, but for a game where Sackboy finally gets some new friends, LittleBigPlanet  can be mighty lonely.
  Negative
LittleBigPlanet  begins as Sackboy's world is thrown into chaos thanks to the scheming of Newton, an invention-obsessed egomaniac given a delightful voiceover by Hugh Laurie.
  Negative
In order to thwart Newton and the evil titans he's unleashed, Sackboy has to hunt down three legendary heroes to ask for their help.
  Negative
More importantly, each of these characters adds to the variety of platforming gameplay available in LittleBigPlanet.
  Negative
For example, Oddsock brings the high-precision jumping that the series has always lacked.
  Negative
He can run up walls, jump off of them and generally land exactly where you want him every time.
  Negative
And he feels great!
  Positive
The difference between performing a precarious jump as Sackboy and doing the same as Oddsock is night and day.
  Neutral
Toggle adds physics-based shenanigans, while Swoop carries the power of flight and hovering.
  Positive
While neither of those adds quite as much as Oddsock's tight controls, their mechanics feel fully developed and fun in and of themselves.
  Positive
But the new additions to LittleBigPlanet 's characters are criminally underused in the game's brief story mode.
  Negative
I didn't even have the full crew together until directly before the final stage.
  Negative
Each new character gets one stage and one boss fight to themselves in the main story, as well as a final stage where you jump between each of the characters for different segments.
  Positive
The rest of the main-path levels stick you with Sackboy.
  Positive
For whatever it's worth, Sumo Digital has put in the effort to make Sackboy more interesting in light of his new companions.
  Positive
Sackboy is now equipped with a "Sackpocket," which carries a variety of power-ups, such as a helmet that allows him to latch onto wires and a jetpack offering short boosts through the air.
  Negative
You can equip one of these power-ups at any time that you're playing as Sackboy, and while they aren't game-changing in the way the new characters are, they certainly helped keep a third time playing as Sony's affable sackcloth hero from getting boring.
  Negative
At this point in the review, you may have picked up on something: I've talked about each of the protagonists individually but not as a team.
  Negative
The LittleBigPlanet series is, after all, highly praised for its co-op friendliness.
  Negative
And this entry was introduced at E with a lengthy level demonstration with all four heroes working together.
  Negative
That kind of teamwork with all four characters is nonexistent at worst and annoyingly buried at best.
  Negative
All of the mainline story missions stick to one character.
  Neutral
You can bring in other players, but they'll simply take on a copy of the specific character that level is based around albeit with their own chosen costume pieces to help differentiate them.
  Neutral
It would be an exaggeration to say that this ruins the game, but it feels like a huge missed opportunity.
  Very negative
Each character in LittleBigPlanet  is enjoyable to play as on their own, and I suspect they're easier to design levels around this way as well.
  Positive
But bringing all four together makes for much stranger, more frantic scenarios.
  Negative
These scarce levels brought out the kind of off-the-wall imagination that is so core to the franchise, and I wanted more of them.
  Positive
Perhaps Sumo Digital hopes that content shortage will be fixed by the community itself.
  Negative
LittleBigPlanet 's user-created content tools are deeper than ever, including the ability to make new tools for the Sackpocket.
  Positive
The game also features a lengthier and more well-rounded set of tutorials on how to create levels than ever before.
  Positive
LittleBigPlanet  also attempts to ease players into the act of creation within the story mode.
  Negative
Some side levels include new "Contraption Challenges," wherein you're tasked with putting together makeshift vehicles for different tasks.
  Negative
For example, I stuck tennis ball wheels on a water bottle and used a fan as a flapper in a challenge to take a jump and get as much air as possible.
  Negative
Contraption Challenges didn't completely ease the anxiety I feel every time I look at a blank canvas in create mode.
  Negative
But for someone who's always been more into the playing side of LittleBigPlanet rather than creating, they pushed me to explore everything the game offers a little more thoroughly.
  Negative
Perhaps the most impressive part of LittleBigPlanet  is that despite the move to a new generation of hardware, every piece of user-generated content from the previous two games is playable here.
  Positive
That means for anyone jumping into the series fresh, you'll have literally millions of player-created levels to check out, many of which are really quite good.
  Positive
That transition hasn't been without issue, however.
  Negative
While allowing all of those levels to run in LittleBigPlanet  is quite the technical feat, it's introduced a number of hiccups and bugs.
  Positive
The biggest problem I encountered seemed to involve visual layers.
  Negative
Where previous games only allowed creators to move characters around a few levels of depth on a D plane, LittleBigPlanet  allows for up to  layers to be used.
  Negative
That's an impressive number, but it's been retroactively applied in a sometimes confused way.
  Positive
While playing levels created in the previous games, I often found myself mysteriously pushed into background layers and stuck on objects or paths I was never supposed to touch.
  Negative
That's not the only bug plaguing LittleBigPlanet , either.
  Negative
I ran into weird slowdown issues when playing online multiplayer, even with only one other participant.
  Negative
I also hit strange glitches where the menu graphics would disappear, and certain sections in levels where character respawns would mysteriously stop working.
  Negative
Sony is promising a day-one patch that is supposed to fix some of these issues, but if you want a bug-free experience, you may be waiting a lot longer.
  Negative
If anything, that's the theme LittleBigPlanet  left me pondering: delayed gratification.
  Negative
Despite switching to a new developer, it has the big ideas and wide-eyed, arms-open demeanor of the series at its best.
  Positive
Yet it never totally commits, never goes all the way with its new concepts and characters.
  Negative
LittleBigPlanet 's devoted fans will surely craft some excellent levels in the months to come, but mostly this feels like a proof of concept for a much better LittleBigPlanet .
  Neutral
