This is a very good strategy game.
  Very positive
I expect nothing less from a franchise that has dedicated itself to turn-based strategy for more than two decades, from a developer that has consistently proven that it understands the dark mysteries of hooking players; the ineffable secret of "one ... more ... turn."
  Negative
Civilization , was not so much a game as a platform upon which Firaxis worked through its own discoveries about potentialities and possibilities.
  Negative
Beyond Earth manifests itself as the latest example of this process.
  Positive
Beyond Earth is an adventure about the future of humanity, an ode to discovery and to enquiry.
  Positive
It is also a work of science itself, the result of developer Firaxis' patient accumulation of data and ideas, culminating in a gameplay machine that whirrs with a fierce and quiet efficiency.
  Positive
The opening moments of a game of Beyond Earth almost precisely match the start of Civilization .
  Positive
In the latter, players began with a rudimentary settlement on Earth, around the time of the discovery of agriculture.
  Negative
Here, the game begins in the A.D. s, and that first settlement is a landing pod from Earth filled with refugees seeking a new beginning.
  Negative
The techs, the soldiers, the buildings, are all of a science fiction bent.
  Negative
Instead of learning writing and crafting a wheel for the first time, I researched Astrodynamics and built a Thorium Reactor.
  Negative
Apart from luminescent fungal visuals, the hex-based landscape remains much the same, overlaid upon a rolling mosaic of countryside dotted with features, obstacles and resources upon which players make use of their own intelligence to gather goods and execute military victories.
  Negative
Any Civilization  player entering Beyond Earth can launch themselves into this new world immediately, without any need of guidance.
  Negative
But as I looked beyond the basic structure, I started to sense some very clever tweaks, shifts and improvements that bring new efficiencies to the formula and new pleasures to the player.
  Positive
An affinity system asks the player to choose a philosophy, from a list of three.
  Negative
This pseudo-personality system feeds into every part of the game, dispensing upgrades to military units, affecting diplomatic relationships with AI civilizations and offering up paths to victory, as well as special quests and unique buildings.
  Positive
Crucially, it impacts the player's scientific research decisions.
  Negative
At first I thought that the new tech web, which eschews the more traditional linear approach, might all be window dressing, that I would find a research path fairly quickly and stick to it, as I have done in the past with this series.
  Negative
But although the early game demands certain techs as soon as possible, I found myself using the tech web in a much more opportunistic and reactive way, seeking out discoveries that would resolve immediate crises while also taking a long term strategic view where possible.
  Negative
I was really playing the discovery system, rather than simply figuring out a most efficient path.
  Negative
My passage through affinity levels gave me upgrade options on military units, which dispensed with the tedious business of spending money to update soldiers who had fallen behind the times.
  Negative
The game expected me to work at advancing my civilization, but it has taken some of the drudgery out of this process.
  Neutral
Bravo for that.
  Positive
Key resources are extensively intertwined with the building of certain units and buildings so that the importance of resources to buildings and units has been expanded, splintering the potential shape and path of each civilization according to the goods it can find.
  Negative
The link between resources and happiness has also been killed.
  Positive
The citizens in your cities must be kept healthy through specific constructions and the management of unhealthy hexes smothered in miasma.
  Negative
Keeping citizens healthy is extremely challenging, but the penalties feel more on a sliding scale than the binary punishments of the previous game.
  Negative
I don't miss chasing around for luxury goods to keep my minions from revolting or, even worse, seeking out natural wonders as short-term boosts to happiness.
  Negative
Beyond Earth has pulled back some of the features and clutter that have accumulated in the series.
  Positive
It all feels like a clever exercise in "less is more" theory.
  Negative
As I encountered each change in the formula I saw the good sense in its inclusion, exclusion or modification.
  Positive
The alterations do not come across as gimmicky.
  Negative
On the contrary, they feel like hard-thought innovations.
  Negative
Even after many hours of play, I continue finding neat little ideas.
  Positive
It's as good an indication as any that, far from taking an extant game and slapping on a sci fi wraparound, Firaxis has gazed into the future and brought meaningful changes to the format.
  Positive
At this point, I feel I ought to make a confession.
  Negative
As someone who much prefers historical fiction to futuristic speculation, I did not expect to really love this brave new world of Civness back in the 's, I never really got into Alpha Centauri.
  Negative
For me, the discovery of the printing press is always going to feel more authentic and solid than figuring out the mysteries of collaborative thought.
  Positive
I am always going to take more pleasure in a Ship-o'-the-Line than a Xeno Swarm.
  Negative
This prejudice was seriously undone by Civilization: Beyond Earth.
  Negative
Beginning with its emotionally powerful intro video above, and on through the new world, the aliens, the techs, the units, the cities, there is so much here to admire and to enjoy.
  Positive
I particularly liked the beautiful art and animation.
  Very positive
This attention to the tiniest of details, like the way a robot worker handles a girder, brings the greater world to life.
  Positive
This plays out in the sciences that the game utilizes as it paints a vision of the future.
  Positive
Firaxis hasn't exactly reinvented the notion of science fiction purple mushrooms, green aliens, spooky miasma, silver spaceships et al. but it has obviously melded these familiars with deeply researched ideas about settling new planets, about the technologies of tomorrow and about human frailties in a strange new world.
  Negative
From the beginning, it's clear that the planet you land upon is not exactly pleased to see you.
  Negative
Aliens cannot be exterminated without advanced and numerable military units.
  Negative
Resources cannot be exploited without study.
  Negative
Distances cannot be traversed without significant perils.
  Negative
There is an underlying question about why you are here and what you hope to achieve, and this plays itself out in the game's multiple victory conditions, many of which demand a relationship between the player and the planet, that is absent in previous games.
  Positive
Winning, or even surviving, feels more like an act of creativity than merely of conquest.
  Negative
This is the chief charm of Civilization games, and Beyond Earth highlights it.
  Positive
The process of playing through the game exists at a nexus between mine and the designer's imaginations, allowing for infinite creative possibilities within a tight set of rules.
  Positive
There are minor irritations in Civilization: Beyond Earth.
  Negative
The intelligence of computer-controlled players has been improved somewhat from previous games.
  Positive
They don't seem quite as susceptible to prideful rage and suicide-by-pointless-invasion, although you can still expect to see their units crawling aimlessly over your territory, turn-after-turn, or an enemy refusing to come to terms when an offensive campaign has clearly ground to a halt.
  Negative
Doing business with them  even with the addition of a new favor bargaining chip that can be cashed in later  rarely feels like its adding much to the overall experience.
  Negative
Most of the time, their incursions into my consciousness just feels like an annoyance.
  Negative
The end-game can become something of a chore.
  Neutral
If you have amassed significant resources and are playing toward a guaranteed win, it begins to feel like you're running on a treadmill.
  Negative
This is a standard problem with large-scale strategy games.
  Negative
I also do not love the simplistic visual iconic organization of units and techs.
  Negative
Obviously a nod to futuristic aesthetics, there were, nevertheless, times when I confused one kind of unit for another.
  Negative
Likewise, the Wonders are not nearly as pleasing in their presentation as in previous games and the end-game sequences seem skimpy and unsatisfactory.
  Negative
But these are quibbles about what is an entirely satisfactory strategic fantasy.
  Positive
Beyond Earth is a pretty play set that takes standard futuristic visuals and ideas and furnishes them with scientific relevance and strategic urgency.
  Negative
The game is dotted with quests and ideas that feel authentic, just like a really good sci fi novel.
  Very positive
here.
