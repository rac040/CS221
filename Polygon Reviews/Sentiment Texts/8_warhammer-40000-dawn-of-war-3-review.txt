Warhammer ,: Dawn of War  is a war game in which I view the battle from above, like a child of yore playing with tin soldiers.
  Negative
Its central activities are building futuristic, fantasy warriors and sending them off on sorties in order to capture strategic points, destroy enemy units and demolish enemy infrastructure.
  Negative
With that in mind, I approach a one-vs-one encounter with all the necessary precautions.
  Positive
I build, I prepare, I attack.
  Negative
Sneakily, I send a small detachment of snipers and space marines to maul an enemy resource point to my left.
  Negative
They will die, but their sacrifice will be worthwhile.
  Positive
By the time these soldiers are intercepted by the enemy, my gigantic main force will be well on its way to crushing heavily defended redoubts to my right, punching through to a bold assault on the enemy's central fortifications.
  Negative
As expected, the enemy rushes defenses towards my feint attack.
  Negative
But then, something odd happens to my main force.
  Negative
A giant spiral of red mist descends from the sky, like a Biblical column of death.
  Negative
It only lasts about  seconds, but in that time, my entire army is obliterated.
  Negative
The weapon is so powerful, it undoes my entire strategy.
  Positive
This is not something I'd anticipated.
  Negative
I'm not exactly doomed by this reversal  there is time to recover  but my dreams of a quick breakthrough are dashed.
  Negative
In truth, I really ought to have understood that packing my army together and setting off like a giant fist would come to grief.
  Negative
I'd already played more than  hours of Dawn of War 's single-player campaign, making use of just such a mega-weapon.
  Negative
But multiplayer contests always pose different kinds of problems than single-player campaigns.
  Negative
Unfortunately, I'm the kind of person who learns best through experience.
  Negative
The more annihilating the experience, the better I learn the lesson.
  Positive
In my next multiplayer session, I take the time to upgrade my systems to the point where I can use my own version of the sky bomb.
  Negative
I make sure to separate my units into more discrete squads, making use of handy quick-keys to separate melee and range units.
  Negative
Things work out better for me.
  Positive
Dawn of War  is a real-time strategy game from developer Relic, a company that has spent  years working almost entirely on the same genre.
  Neutral
From Homeworld to Company of Heroes to the Dawn of War series, Relic has repeatedly produced well-liked, highly rated RTS games.
  Negative
In Dawn of War , Relic has sought to scatter the remnants of lazy RTS loopholes, like my ill-fated mob attack.
  Negative
It has also strengthened the previous game's range of selectable and powerful heroes.
  Positive
Finally, it has sought to create battle simulations that demand aggressive action, rather than dull, defensive attrition tactics.
  Negative
Making real progress to the RTS is a significant challenge and, indeed, like all such games, Dawn of War  follows the rote template of building, amassing, attacking and consolidating.
  Negative
Not much has changed.
  Negative
While other genres like action-adventures and first-person shooters have progressed a great deal in recent years  benefiting from technological improvements in processing power and graphics as well as in storytelling  the RTS has stayed comparatively static.
  Negative
Perhaps the top-down boardgame view of these games only allows for incremental progression.
  Neutral
As a genre, RTS games have colonized mobile platforms and the nauseating world of free-to-play.
  Negative
But on its native PC, it has merely become more esoteric and specialized.
  Neutral
Dawn of War  fits this pattern, but it's nothing if not ferociously competent.
  Negative
Dawn of War 's entire world is based on the Warhammer K space-age tabletopfantasy fiction universe, a nihilistic environment of murderous warfare.
  Negative
Three races are on offer, each pleasingly different than the other, though adhering to long-established stereotypes.
  Neutral
Eldar, a elf-like race of wistful mystics, are angelic and magical.
  Very positive
They produce powerful ranged units, supported by persistent melee fighters.
  Positive
They are motivated by scripture and so are prone to schisms.
  Negative
They bear themselves like aristocrats, haughty and dismissive of lesser beings.
  Negative
Human Space Marines are the most centrally balanced, with a good mix of melee, range and mechanical units.
  Positive
They are motivated by honor and loyalty to their emperor.
  Positive
When they speak, they sound like a bunch of English coppers enjoying a weekend rugby tour, well prepared for a bloody good scrum.
  Positive
The Orks are, as you'd expect, ugly, mean and vicious.
  Negative
They speak  like so many of their kind  in the manner of s Cockney gangsters, a dirty rabble of working class oiks.
  Negative
They are motivated by loot and the attainment of power for its own sake.
  Negative
They are treacherous and violent.
  Negative
This is the standard class-snobbery of fantasy fiction, from the donnish Tolkien to today.
  Negative
Apart from the grotesque Orks, most of the characters in this game spout repetitious lines that would not be amiss in the most absurd medieval chivalric fables.
  Negative
These people exist for no other reason than to kill one another, and they seem perfectly content with their lot in life.
  Positive
The single-player campaign is long and comprehensive.
  Negative
Unlike previous Dawn of War games, in which the core games playable campaign races were the humans non-human expansions came later, Dawn of War  required me to play all three races in a series of chapters that amounted to a thin story about the capture of a mega-weapon and the awakening of a dark force.
  Negative
Missions ranged from resource capture to stealth to wave defense.
  Negative
While I found the campaign to be a useful way to familiarize myself with the game's many systems, units and tactics, it's also repetitive, with a few missions that are downright frustrating.
  Negative
I made much use of save games in order to get through the most enraging scenarios.
  Negative
Like most RTS games, the real value is in multiplayer.
  Positive
Dawn of War  offers -v-, -v- and -v- on a single space station map.
  Negative
It's here that Relic's dedication to the genre is tested to the full.
  Positive
Over the last  years, the Dawn of War series has evolved significantly.
  Negative
When the first game came out in , it was widely accepted as a reasonably standard addition to a fading genre, albeit one that sported good-looks and an attractive fantasy world.
  Negative
Resource gathering was a semi-automatic matter of capturing territory and building resource points, rather than fussing around with resource units.
  Negative
This central tenet remains in Dawn of War .
  Negative
There are no workers in this world.
  Negative
Resources can only be secured by conquering and holding resource points.
  Negative
These can only be harvested by investing in upgrades.
  Negative
They require defensive building projects.
  Neutral
There are a finite number of these points.
  Positive
The ones that matter are situated at the center of the map.
  Neutral
Dawn of War's  sequel swerved into Diablo territory with upgradeable squads that were designed to stay with the player.
  Negative
It also dispensed with base-building, and introduced Heroes.
  Positive
In Dawn of War , buildings are back, but there's not too many of them.
  Negative
There's generally a standard barracks, a building for specialized mid-tier units, one for advanced machines as well as another for handling upgrades and buffs.
  Negative
Units have retained some of the RPG-elements of the last game, with upgrades and secondary abilities on offer.
  Positive
There are also pre-game selectable buffs that affect favored types of units, allowing the player to focus on particular strategies.
  Positive
But these units carry a far greater sense of disposability than in Dawn of War .
  Positive
Large armies and massive battles are encouraged.
  Negative
In any given game, lots of soldiers die.
  Negative
Many of them die quickly.
  Negative
In early phases of the game, the player gets refunds on killed units.
  Negative
As the game progresses through specific timed phases, these refunds diminish.
  Negative
This  and the contested resource points  encourages probing attacks in early parts of the game, pressuring players to range outwards, rather than digging in behind fortification.
  Negative
Multiplayer maps are confounding, to say the least.
  Negative
They require multiple defensive points on home turf, as well as on those fiercely contested middle grounds.
  Negative
The loss of resource points is a significant disadvantage, and although not an automatic losing position, does make it extremely difficult to win the entire contest.
  Negative
There's no question of attempting to win by building multiple basic units fast and early.
  Neutral
The win-state requires the destruction of three placements, including an array of powerful guns.
  Negative
Victory must be earned through a combination of surprise attacks, smart attrition and solid defense.
  Positive
Undoubtedly, the main departure from previous RTS game is in the imposing power and personalities of the Elite units, a beefed up version of the last game's Heroes.
  Positive
Elites are earned over time by the accretion of Elite points, which is mostly automated but is also hurried by capturing resource areas.
  Negative
Elites have cooldown moves that yield major destruction against enemies, scattering them to the ground.
  Negative
There's also a hierarchy among them that adds complexity to their tactical use.
  Positive
Some can be introduced fairly early to a game, while others require the patience of holding out until late in the game.
  Neutral
These late game giants are so powerful that they tend to tip games one way or the other.
  Positive
At times, the use of these Elites focuses so much attention, that the business of creating and upgrading lesser units can seem almost marginal.
  Negative
An Elite can stomp a medium sized force out of existence, but it takes many standard units to take out an Elite.
  Positive
In any case, Elites don't die.
  Negative
They just take a timeout for a few minutes.
  Negative
Even so, I found myself figuring out that Elites need to be supported properly, by making the correct use of standard units, most especially how they interact with cover and stealth positions.
  Negative
This is not a game for those who like to build lots of units and throw them at an enemy, hoping that force will win the day.
  Negative
Correct use of snipers, air-power and melee units makes an enormous difference to combat outcomes.
  Negative
Dawn of War  makes an admirable attempt to nudge forward a genre that has struggled in recent years to progress.
  Negative
The addition of Elites offers intriguing and complex challenges for those who are prepared to put in the necessary practice.
  Positive
Relic has obviously thought long and hard about how realtime strategy might best be improved  even if true evolution seems out of the games grasp.
  Neutral
