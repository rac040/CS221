Ten years ago, Blizzard never would have made Overwatch.
  Negative
This is not a knock on either the company or the game.
  Negative
It's simply the state of the industry right now.
  Positive
Blizzard was once known for its juggernaut of an MMO and other big-budget sequels.
  Neutral
What became Overwatch began life as a game from that era.
  Neutral
Titan was an epic, sci-fi action massively multiplayer online game in the vein of World of Warcraft, designed to operate on the scale of that behemoth.
  Negative
But over the course of almost a decade, Titan became a boondoggle, doomed in fits and starts to become one of the most whispered about failures of the modern gaming era.
  Negative
And by the time Blizzard canceled Titan, the industry had changed.
  Negative
Blizzard had started focusing on smaller projects, games like Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm, which are easier to support and create new content for.
  Negative
But from the ashes of Titan, Blizzard found Overwatch.
  Negative
A continuation of the same philosophy behind those smaller projects, Overwatch is a tighter, more focused multiplayer shooter that strives to do just a few things  but it does them very, very well.
  Positive
Overwatch the latest in a long string of hero-centric action games that have been dominating the video game world these last few years.
  Negative
Blizzard's take on the genre is a shooter with an emphasis on class synergy and cooperation.
  Negative
In the world of Overwatch, lone wolves are left to die.
  Negative
As a multiplayer shooter, Overwatch follows in Team Fortress 's footsteps pretty closely, sticking with simply defined objectives in matches.
  Negative
Every match is some variant of "capture this point" or "defend this point."
  Negative
While not wholly original, these basic objectives accomplish one important thing: They force constant clashes between a wide range of bizarre heroes, all striving for the same strip of land.
  Positive
Overwatchs cast of characters is staggeringly diverse, even within their basic classes of Offense, Defense, Tank and Support.
  Positive
Take two Tank characters, for instance: Roadhog and Winston.
  Neutral
Tank characters are identified by their massive size, and while both Winston and Roadhog are unquestionably large and have a ton of health, that's about where the similarities end.
  Negative
Roadhog is a slow-moving, post-apocalyptic pig man seriously with a hook to drag people within range of his shotgun.
  Negative
Winston is a hyper intelligent gorilla from the moon seriously with insane mobility thanks to his leap and a defensive shield that helps keep the team alive.
  Very positive
That sort of diversity is especially impressive when you consider that it extends across the  currently playable characters in the game with more planned to be added at some point after release.
  Positive
Granted, some of these characters do fall into familiar archetypes.
  Negative
Soldier:  plays like he just walked out of a Call of Duty game, and Torbjrn has a lot in common with Team Fortress 's turret-building Engineer.
  Negative
But, more often than not, these characters feel unique within Overwatch itself and are extremely fun to play.
  Positive
While I easily found intense matches while playing as an Offense character, I was surprised to find that my enjoyment extended to playing as supports and healers.
  Positive
Unlike most healers, where your task is simply to follow someone around giving them the occasional buff, healers in Overwatch must constantly juggle responsibilities and opportunities.
  Negative
Zenyatta, a robotic yogi, is able to toss two metallic balls, one for healing friends and another for weakening enemies.
  Negative
Each game ends up feeling like a hellacious balancing act, trying to keep your friends alive while they take down targets you've marked.
  Negative
Abilities designed around teamwork are common throughout the entire cast.
  Negative
Mercy, another healer, is essentially harmless on her own.
  Negative
She's slow-moving and has a puny pistol.
  Negative
But if she targets a friendly player, even across the map, she can unfurl her wings and slingshot over to that player faster than any other character in the game.
  Negative
She can place herself right in the thick of an objective, heal a Tank and make them an unstoppable combo.
  Positive
These character combos add depth and strategy to Overwatch, following the easy-to-learn, hard-to-master adage.
  Negative
The downside is that new players may be frustrated as they begin their journey.
  Negative
This may be a consequence of all players essentially starting from scratch, but more than half of the games I played in Overwatch felt like absolute blowouts, where nary a single objective was captured.
  Negative
This makes for a frustrating experience if you're on the losing team, constantly running into an unbreakable wall of turrets and space gorillas.
  Very negative
And if you're on the winning team, winning this way feels boring.
  Negative
Some of the blame for these upsets presumably falls on matchmaking, which is struggling to determine who is good or not as Overwatch launches.
  Negative
But some of this also falls on Overwatchs map design.
  Negative
Certain maps, such as a snowy Russian military base or a Japanese village, are oriented around single chokepoints where the attacking team must stream into certain death.
  Negative
Upon crossing these chokepoints, these maps open up and offer multiple attack routes to the objective, but getting through that first hurdle is a frustrating endeavor.
  Negative
These hurdles are particularly tricky to overcome when you're playing with randoms that don't feel like cooperating.
  Negative
Since Overwatch is so focused on teamwork, playing alone is pretty miserable.
  Negative
While there are emotes to indicate your request for a timely heal or to group up, you'll regularly run up against a squad on voice chat who is dialed in to ensuring you wont survive more than  steps.
  Negative
This is less of an issue in series like Call of Duty, where a single player can swing a match with some impressive streaks, but that's really not possible in Overwatch.
  Negative
Unless you're able to convince your friends to join you on this journey, you're going to have a tough time.
  Negative
With just two or three friends, though, the game becomes immeasurably more tactical.
  Negative
When you're not busy strategizing with your friends, you may want to take a minute to enjoy the beauty of Blizzards art direction.
  Positive
The game is bursting with color and looks more like a new Disney XD show than a dark, gritty shooter.
  Positive
Even "scary" characters like the undead Reaper spout pop culture references and sport goofy alternate costumes.
  Neutral
Maps are set around the world and feel equally bright and fun, with sun-dappled Grecian streets to a steampunk London subway system.
  Positive
For a game that's about all-out slaughtering the other team, it's refreshingly Pixar-ish...without the heartbreaking "dead wife" scenes.
  Positive
You can also catch up on the lore right here.
  Positive
Within the game there's almost no backstory beyond an introductory cutscene that lays out some vague basics.
  Negative
If you don't care about the lore after all, you've saved the world before, haven't you?
  Negative
, you may ask yourself what's forcing you to keep playing.
  Neutral
That feeling of "just-one-more-game" exists, simply because Overwatch is so well designed, but it's hard to wait out miserable blowouts, especially when there's very little to "work" for.
  Negative
Upon leveling up, players are granted loot boxes which unlock a variety of cosmetic upgrades.
  Negative
Unfortunately the vast majority of loot box rewards are dull accessories I never used, such as spray paints or player icons.
  Negative
Alternate character skins are somewhat common, but the rarest legendary drops only come around about once in  boxes.
  Negative
Without paying real money, that could easily take  hours to earn just through playing, and even then there's no telling whether you'll actually like the skin you unlock.
  Negative
This frustration is slightly eased by the ability to earn coins out of loot boxes.
  Negative
You can spend that currency on anything in the game, though it's going to take a while to build up the sums you'd need to unlock some of the cooler skins.
  Neutral
This is a long way of saying that Overwatch places a heavy emphasis on in-app purchasing if you're looking to customize a handful of characters.
  Neutral
This practice has become the norm in free-to-play games, but seeing it in a - title is discouraging.
  Negative
Even Activision's own Call of Duty: Black Ops , which offered a similar system, had dozens of cool unlocks tied to player skill.
  Negative
Overwatch has hardly any.
  Negative
Overall content is equally limited in Overwatch.
  Negative
Compared to competitively priced shooters, there are considerably fewer modes just three King of the Hill variants and no campaign mode to speak of here.
  Negative
Even with  playable characters and  maps, it still ends up feeling like a barebones package against the competition, at least at the game's launch.
  Negative
While the PC version of Overwatch can be run at much higher resolutions, all versions of the game are graphically pretty comparable and on-par with one another, running at a steady  frames-per-second.
  Negative
It does feel, though, that the console version got the short end of the stick in some areas.
  Negative
A majorly annoying omission: Console players can't bring their party with them if they decide to leave a game.
  Negative
On the PC, this is an option, but on console, the only way to leave a game is to leave the party outright.
  Negative
This becomes especially annoying as friends filter online and request invites, since each invite essentially requires another disbanding.
  Very negative
Another unfortunate issue: If you're playing on PS or Xbox One and friends request to join your party, you'll be given a pop-up to hit Y to accept or the N to decline.
  Negative
This is particularly tricky given that the Xbox controller only has the former of those buttons and the PS controller has exactly none of them.
  Negative
Whoops!
  Neutral
There's no question that Overwatch is a masterfully designed game.
  Positive
The wide array of amazing, unique characters, and the original ways they interact with one another, make for a peerless teamplay experience in the shooter space.
  Positive
Some issues, like a dissatisfying progression system  and a hostility to solo players, hinder the overall experience, but the core of Overwatch remains strong throughout.
  Negative
It's an easy recommendation to make, so long as you've got some friends to back you up.
  Very positive
here.
  Neutral
