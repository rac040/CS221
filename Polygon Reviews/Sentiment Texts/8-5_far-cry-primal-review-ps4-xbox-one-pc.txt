I can't remember the last time I would have described a Ubisoft open-world game as "audacious."
  Negative
The first Assassin's Creed game, certainly, but since then the series has evolved more than it has been revolutionized.
  Positive
Even Watch Dogs, certainly the biggest departure in recent years, felt like a craven way of repurposing the standards of this publisher-specific subgenre into the most predictable environment possible.
  Negative
But "audacious" is exactly the word for Far Cry Primal, which tears the franchise down to the barest of bones and builds upon those fossils in some new, frequently satisfying and occasionally frustrating ways.
  Negative
Far Cry Primal is set in , B.C.
  Negative
The following should be obvious to you even without a degree in anthropology, but in the interest of clarity, here is what you will not find in the game: guns; vehicles; rocket launchers; hang gliders; a witty villain; a single word of un-subtitled dialogue.
  Negative
If someone slid this list across the table to you and said, "Oh, and it's a Far Cry game," you'd probably think they were having a bit of fun at your expense.
  Negative
For the first few hours, I kept waiting for Ubisoft Montreal to find some cute workarounds for the strictures of the game's setting.
  Negative
A magic machine gun that shoots bone fragments?
  Neutral
A homing slingshot?
  Neutral
I waited in vain.
  Neutral
In the first hour of the game, my main weapons were a club, a bow and a spear.
  Negative
Twenty-five hours later as I headed into the final confrontation with Ull, the Udam chieftain making life hard on my fellow Wenja, my main weapons were a better club, a better bow and a better spear.
  Negative
This is a Far Cry game in the sense that players must scour a diverse world for resources, conquer enemy bases with a blend of stealth and more ostentatious tactics, and unite a people against a common foe through their actions.
  Negative
But the way it expresses these ideas is an enormous departure, the extent of which is hard to overstate.
  Negative
Hunting, relegated to side quests in the past few Far Cry games, shares the stage equally with human-on-human action in Primal.
  Negative
As Takkar, de facto leader of the Wenja people, players must rebuild their village and upgrade their weapons with a steady supply of animal skins harvested from increasingly exotic and deadly creatures.
  Negative
Gathering is just as important as hunting; rare trees and rocks are required for most big upgrades, and a variety of plants are needed to create boosts for Takkar's strength, speed and fire resistance.
  Positive
Taking down enemy camps can produce a new fast travel location, but the real reward is in a slight increase to the population of Takkar's village.
  Negative
The Wenja have been scattered from their home by invading tribes, and Takkar is charged with rescuing them and bringing them home.
  Negative
Hosting more villagers translates to a slight experience boost and, crucially, an increase in skins and other resources being harvested by your people.
  Negative
Even Takkar's ability to heal himself is reliant on eating the meat of the animals you've brought down, so you're almost never at a point where hunting and gathering aren't crucial.
  Negative
Past Far Cry games have been domination fantasies.
  Neutral
But Primal is about survival.
  Neutral
The land of Oros is brutal, and it's only slightly less so after Takkar has unlocked all the upgrades to his weapons and his natural resistance to injury.
  Very negative
You will never be strong enough to take on a wooly mammoth or equally savage beast without a lick of planning or strategy, and that feels incredibly refreshing in a franchise that tends to elevate players to demigod status by the halfway point.
  Negative
That does not mean, however, that Takkar doesn't become more powerful.
  Negative
His greatest strength, and the biggest mechanical addition to the Far Cry formula as opposed to the many subtractions, is the protagonist's ability to tame the predators of Oros.
  Positive
Bears are ferocious, but slow.
  Negative
Cats are stealthier, but easier to kill.
  Neutral
Rare varieties have special abilities, like the black jaguar, which can kill enemies without alerting their compatriots.
  Negative
Once breeds of animals are in Takkar's service, they can be summoned at will depending on what the situation calls for.
  Negative
My impulsive desire to catch 'em all prompted a frankly embarrassing portion of my brain to create the portmanteau "Po-cave-man" which works better out loud, if only slightly.
  Negative
Also, you can shoot a flaming arrow while riding your pet saber-toothed tiger, which will be a hard act to top when "Raddest Game Stuff That Happened in " lists start popping up this December.
  Negative
If Takkar's ability to see through the eyes of an owl to tag enemies before bringing down a camp doesn't also make the list, we're in for a very rad year indeed.
  Negative
It's hard to express how much having a persistent partner spices up the equation of combat in Far Cry.
  Negative
I've always felt a little frustrated when my attempts at stealthily wiping out enemy camps devolved into gunfights, but summoning my close personal friend the mean-ass bear to even the odds is a hell of a spoonful of sugar to help that particular medicine go down.
  Negative
Some of Primal's changes haven't been honed to the laser-sharp edge of Far Cry's more established mechanics.
  Negative
For example: The ability to take down unaware enemies with a single button press returns, but chains of takedowns are often frustratingly sabotaged by overzealous pets, which cost me quite a few experience points.
  Negative
There's also a bit of all-but-expected open-world instability I fell inside rocks on two separate occasions, forcing me to fast-travel to escape, for instance.
  Negative
Animal AI produces some amazing organic moments that make the world feel vital and alive  seeing a pack of wolves chasing deer or goats is not uncommon  but when beasts behave more erratically, Oros feels more like a broken Disneyland ride than an untamed wilderness.
  Positive
Appropriately, Primal is a game that leans into Far Cry's basest lizard-brain pleasures.
  Positive
You're getting constant dopamine hits from finding the next saplinganimal skincool rock that will let you become just a smidgen less killable.
  Negative
At the same time, it eschews the trademark sardonic humor, charismatic cast and moral dilemmas that have turned the franchise into the closest thing we have to the thinking person's open-world shooter.
  Positive
This comes at a cost.
  Neutral
The perhaps chronologically appropriate lack of richly detailed characters meant that I was never particularly engaged in Primal's threadbare narrative.
  Negative
The lack of mechanical diversity led to a sameness that turned most single-player missions into something of a chore.
  Negative
But something about the utilitarian nature of Far Cry Primal clicked with me, beyond my own magpie-esque affinity for picking up every scrap of flint and animal fat dotting the landscape.
  Negative
By removing some of the more ostentatious tics from the franchise, Ubisoft has also removed many of the distractions from the beautiful, brutal land it has created for players to explore.
  Negative
This leads to the most immersive world in the Far Cry series, and one that didn't bore for a moment of the hours I spent attempting to tame it.
  Negative
here.
  Neutral
