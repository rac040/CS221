PlanetSide  captures the drama of war better than any Call of Duty or Battlefield ever has  a feat accomplished with brute force and big numbers.
  Positive
Soldiers storm sci-fi encampments instead of the beaches of Normandy, but the song's the same: Bullets and rockets fly inches overhead as foot soldiers and a convoy of assault vehicles crash against an enemy base, all to an imagined movement of "Ride of the Valkyries."
  Negative
This is PlanetSide 's iconic, advertised gameplay cross-section, and when it actually happens, it's unlike anything you've ever played.
  Negative
It's also unlike anything you've ever played when you're searching for your place in the war effort.
  Neutral
PlanetSide  is most rewarding when the player is part of something bigger than themselves  in fact, that's the only scenario in which PlanetSide  is rewarding.
  Very positive
A shooter has never made a single player feel so impotent.
  Negative
PlanetSide  is a celebration of expansionist conflict.
  Positive
Three factions are tasked with conquering vital facilities strewn across three continents.
  Negative
Each facility has a control point that must be captured and held for a predetermined amount of time, and armies can only capture facilities touching regions they already control.
  Positive
A faction's influence over a continent can really only move in waves  and, as a result, so do its armies.
  Positive
The good news is that getting involved with one of these continent-wide efforts is a fairly painless process.
  Positive
There are a few options for joining a -solder squad, which may also be part of a four-squad platoon.
  Negative
The simplest way is tapping "Insert" to auto-join a suitable group, but you might have to hoof it to the part of the battle where your team is located.
  Negative
You can also automatically deploy near your squad leader or to any active battle on the world map, though this function is on a cooldown of  minutes or more.
  Negative
Being a part of one of these platoons is genuinely thrilling, and not always for the reasons you might expect.
  Positive
Bigger armies mean bigger battles, which is where PlanetSide  handily excels.
  Positive
The fights aren't just huge, they're incredibly dynamic.
  Positive
There is a lot you could be doing in any given skirmish: reviving teammates, repairing tanks, dogfighting with light aircraft, piloting a troop transport, spearheading the charge on an ATV and so on.
  Negative
In a large enough battle, all of those things can happen simultaneously.
  Neutral
PlanetSide 's conflicts are so emergent that even the refrains between them are electrifying.
  Negative
Watching as your entire platoon leaves its HQ to start a new and glorious campaign, with tanks and airships and troops marching in a phalanx  it's a depiction of war like you'd see in a blockbuster film, and you're a part of it every step of the way.
  Negative
As a single soldier in the effort, you can only oscillate between assurance and dread, never quite sure of how the next battle will pan out.
  Negative
Sometimes, that uncertainty is more exciting than the battles themselves.
  Positive
MAG: Being part of the losing team not only lacks a sense of reward or satisfaction  it feels unfair.
  Negative
Maybe it's because your squad leader hasn't updated the waypoint for a half hour, leaving members of your team to respawn agonizingly far away.
  Neutral
Maybe it's because your -person defense force can't fend off the unchecked, -strong battalion beating down your door.
  Negative
Maybe it's because sometimes, when there are tanks posted outside of your respawn rooms harvesting your organs for XP, retreat is the only conceivable option.
  Negative
It might be impossible to balance a shooter of PlanetSide 's size with restrictions and checks to limit more punitive scenarios.
  Negative
Regardless, one-sided fights are nearly as common to PlanetSide  as tense two-or-three-sided battles.
  Negative
I spent just as much time trying to find a battle where I stood any chance of success as I did enjoying those rare balanced conflicts.
  Negative
PlanetSide 's free-to-play model is relatively elegant, not doing much to punish folks who don't cough up real-life dough.
  Positive
Most class upgrades cannot be purchased with Station Cash, the game's real-money currency.
  Negative
Real money is only used for weapons, vanity items and experience or resource boosts.
  Negative
Nearly all the upgrades, including weapons, attachments and class perks, can be unlocked by playing the game normally, though their prices escalate quickly.
  Negative
Having to play for a dozen hours or so to earn enough to unlock one weapon for one class for one faction seems excessive, designed more around player retention than game balance.
  Negative
That kind of design choice isn't even necessary, as there's already way too much to do in PlanetSide  without the grind.
  Negative
PlanetSide 's systems aren't its carrot on a stick.
  Negative
Its joys are entirely emergent.
  Positive
I found myself returning to it every night, not because I was grinding for a new perk for the Combat Medic class, but because I knew that the battles I'd participate in the evenly-matched ones, anyway would never be alike.
  Negative
The forces would be different, the tactics fresh, the last stands and the heroic charges all completely unforeseen.
  Positive
here.
  Neutral
PlanetSide 's adaptation to PlayStation  has fared better than other free-to-play online games that have attempted to cross the console divide.
  Negative
Not much has been lost in translation  certainly not the scale of PlanetSide 's occasionally massive battles, which are as exciting today as they were when the game first launched nearly three years ago.
  Negative
Unfortunately, a few technical shortcomings and unaddressed issues that have always plagued PlanetSide  keep it from reaching its full potential on PS.
  Negative
For better and worse, PlanetSide  still offers the biggest battles I've ever seen in a multiplayer shooter.
  Negative
Between the PS's sizable install base and the game's nonexistent price tag, I haven't struggled to find squadmates to team up with or enemies to assault.
  Negative
Few shooters offer activities more exciting than joining a platoon that's charging an enemy base with tanks, ATVs, dogfighters and infantry, ready to take on a deeply entrenched foe.
  Negative
Unfortunately, it's still difficult to guarantee a satisfying balance in any given battle.
  Negative
Getting barnstormed by one of the game's other two factions simply because your team can't get its shit together still feels like an exercise in futility.
  Negative
The lack of agency you feel as a single player can be suffocating, especially when you're part of an incompetent squad  one that doesn't grasp the game's most important concepts, like how to properly utilize mobile spawn points.
  Negative
It's easy to fault PlanetSide  for its unskilled contingent of players, because the game does very little to educate them.
  Negative
A few tutorial missions are thrown up on the HUD, but those offer rudimentary lessons at best.
  Negative
Strategic considerations  how to properly deploy and utilize the aforementioned Sunderer spawn points, for example  go unexplored.
  Negative
The game's economy doesn't punish free players, but it desperately needs overhauling nonetheless.
  Negative
It still takes hours of playing to earn enough currency to purchase most of the game's guns, which cuts the legs out from under the game's progression hooks completely.
  Negative
You can play for free and still be competitive with the big spenders, but you're going to need to work a lot harder to add some variety to your arsenal.
  Negative
Graphics have, understandably, taken a hit in comparison to PlanetSide 's PC version, although steadiness hasn't exactly improved in tow  your frame rate in particularly explosive battles can get really rocky.
  Negative
Other technical offenses are harder to explain.
  Negative
Sometimes your map takes a really long time to load.
  Negative
Sometimes textures don't process properly on your minimap, making enemy forces look like little squares of static.
  Negative
Sometimes vehicles just disappear, as if by magic.
  Negative
PlanetSide  works on PlayStation , but these visual and technical issues make it soundly inferior to the game's original PC version.
  Negative
It's still a deeply fascinating game, and one that's well-served by having virtually no barrier to entry.
  Positive
The harrowing, thrilling experience of being a small cog in the game's militaristic machine is something unique among modern shooters, and something few other games have accomplished.
  Very positive
It's worth playing, at least once, to try and find that experience; just don't be surprised if you have to work for it.
  Negative
