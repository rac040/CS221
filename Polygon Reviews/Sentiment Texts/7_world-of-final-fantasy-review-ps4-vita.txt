World of Final Fantasy seems like little more than adorable, fluffy fan service at first.
  Negative
In a fall filled to the brim with Final Fantasy media  A movie!
  Positive
An anime!
  Neutral
A new mainline entry!
  Positive
World of Final Fantasy is a cutesy, cameo-filled spinoff that tries to be greater than the sum of its troubled parts.
  Negative
It tries to live up to the Final Fantasy name, even as it gets bogged down in annoying throwbacks that the series has long since grown out of.
  Negative
World of Final Fantasys long-winded, convoluted narrative follows the amnesiac, magically gifted twins Reynn and Lann.
  Negative
The duo wake up at the start of the game with minimal understanding of what's going on.
  Neutral
With the help of Tama, their walking, talking fox sidekick, and denizens both familiar and foreign, Reynn and Lann's journey to save their mother  and the world  in accordance with a controversial prophecy eventually gets under way.
  Negative
The plotline's a total bore, thanks to its sibling leads.
  Negative
Despite their ignorance, the pair are cant go without commentary for even a moment.
  Negative
While I welcomed their flurry of often self-aware jokes at first, their incessant banter later had me thankful there was a fast-forward button.
  Negative
Once the story is under way, though, World of Final Fantasy offers several distractions from Reynn and Lann's yapping.
  Negative
The biggest of these are the battles, which make up the core of the gameplay.
  Negative
Reynn and Lann have two special powers that set them apart from the average role-playing game hero: They can switch between their average-sized human forms and smaller, chibi-style ones, and they can catch and harness the power of monsters called Mirages.
  Positive
Depending on if they're tall or tiny, the siblings can stack up to two monsters on their heads to create an adorable, if unstable totem pole.
  Negative
Collecting Mirages is fun and challenging, as each one has different elemental abilities and capture requirements.
  Very positive
Beyond hunting them down, I spent many hours fine-tuning my monsters' skills and party combinations to nail down different resistances and expanded abilities.
  Negative
Its easy to get lost in building and perfecting your monster collection, and World of Final Fantasy encourages the most detail-oriented player to try to catch 'em all.
  Negative
The dungeons where these Mirages are found are also easy to get lost in, which is good news to anyone resentful of the recent trend of more linear maps in some Final Fantasy games.
  Negative
Each one of these diverse, enormous areas is littered with monsters to capture and puzzles to solve.
  Negative
I spent most of the game traversing them, but each one is unique and memorable enough to keep moving from place to place feeling fresh.
  Positive
Their sizes and layouts were dizzying, but some of my biggest personal victories were conquering the dungeons' inventive shortcuts and specific intricacies.
  Negative
Each dungeon also comes with new monsters to catch, but I saw each one about a hundred times.
  Positive
The random encounter rate is, like the dialogue, one of the highest Ive ever experienced in an RPG.
  Positive
The dungeons' size forced a lot of running back and forth and back again, and constantly happening upon a lengthy monster battle on the way to the next floor gets tiring fast.
  Negative
Just as frustrating as the encounter rate is the number of puzzles required to get through each area.
  Negative
The abundance of tricky puzzles represent the game at its best and its worst.
  Negative
Like the dungeons themselves, the puzzle design is unique to each area; I often had to flip switches with specific conditions, but they were supplemental to the area-specific trials I had to solve.
  Negative
It's just that solving sliding ice puzzles to move forward through the long, layered dungeons gets grating after hours and hours.
  Negative
The dungeons are one of World of Final Fantasy's more nostalgic indulgences, and they began to feel overstuffed with roadblocks.
  Negative
I frittered away needless hours in dungeons that sent me in circles to solve puzzles with zero narrative motivation, all while the same monsters loaded slowly onto my screen, time and again.
  Very negative
What was once interesting design became monotonous quickly.
  Negative
There's a big payoff for surviving these arduous dungeon trials, though.
  Negative
I got to see some of my favorite classic Final Fantasy heroes in action, albeit usually in cutscenes.
  Positive
These are aww-worthy highlights in a sea of otherwise terrible dialogue.
  Negative
The presence of characters like Cloud, Lightning and Tidus doesn't feel as forced as it might; they simply inhabit and protect this, the World of Final Fantasy.
  Negative
I also gained the ability to summon certain Final Fantasy stars in battle for a limited time, but I could only actually play as them in special "champion quests."
  Negative
Unsurprisingly, these quests are often where the game shines.
  Neutral
Instead of following the same rote dungeon runs that drive the main storyline, the side missions include varied types of gameplay.
  Negative
In one, I raced across a map as an adorable version of Final Fantasy s Lightning against a time limit toward a boss.
  Negative
Another included a charming, tough puzzle game starring Vivi and Terra Final Fantasy  and , respectively.
  Positive
They're excellent palate cleansers and more substantive ways of getting hands-on with fan favorites than in-battle cameos.
  Positive
Champion quests are accessible whenever the player gets bored of dungeon crawling.
  Negative
Between those and the minutia of Mirage taming  not to mention a battle coliseum, which spotlights the fun intricacies of fighting  World of Final Fantasy offers a few diversions from the repetition of the main campaign.
  Negative
There's still much to be desired, considering the series' legacy of unforgettable characters and stories, but the variety of options and the pure joy of monster management bode for some deep pleasures.
  Positive
World of Final Fantasy wants to be fan service for everybody, an almost impossible task in such a long-running, varied franchise.
  Positive
In that regard, the game may look like lighthearted filler on the surface.
  Negative
But those shimmers of something greater and World of Final Fantasys more original, modern elements are worthwhile, even if they don't quite make up for the hours of annoyances that pay lip service to nostalgia.
  Positive
here.
