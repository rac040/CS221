And that's actually a good thing.
  Positive
Resident Evil  is a much messier game than the first Revelations.
  Positive
But they share one important trait: an uncertainty about whatResident Evil actually is and a willingness to throw everything at the wall.
  Positive
Resident Evil , Revelations  finds a focus that recent entries have sorely lacked.
  Negative
It has its own strange experiment as a series of episodic releases, but that's just a distraction from the exceedingly strong game at the core here.

Resident Evil Revelations  follows two classic characters from the series' past: Claire Redfield and Barry Burton.
  Negative
In the opening scenes Barry's daughter, Moira, is kidnapped alongside Claire, and the duo are imprisoned on a mysterious island.
  Negative
The narrative jumps back and forth between those two exploring and a second story thread six months later as Barry comes to the island to find Moira.
  Negative
It's notable that Capcom has built a really fun, dumb action storyline almost entirely around women.
  Negative
Three of the four playable characters in the main campaign are women, as is the primary antagonist.
  Negative
They're also memorable, interesting characters, especially newcomer Moira.
  Positive
Her hilariously bizarre stream-of-consciousness swear words can be off-putting  one of her first lines involves the phrase "moist barrel of fucks"  but it congeals into a strange kind of character development over the course of the game.
  Negative
And though Revelations  seems set up for an obvious, "big strong man comes to the rescue" plotline with Barry's chapters, it twists that premise in some really satisfying ways near the conclusion.
  Positive
The dueling storylines set up a predictable rhythm to each episode of the game: You explore an area as Claire and Moira, reach a cliffhanger ending, switch over to Barry and Natalia, the mysterious little girl he teams up with, and retread the same areas but from a different angle.
  Negative
The repetition can get a little numbing by episode three or so, especially because these aren't terribly unique or beautiful settings.
  Negative
Aside from a few outdoor areas on the scenic island where Claire and Moira have been dumped, Revelations 's locations read like a checklist of generic video game levels: abandoned prison, sewer system, rundown apartment building, etc.
  Negative
The graphics  a minor upgrade over the first game  weren't impressive enough to make those spaces much more interesting.
  Negative
I always pushed through, but that was completely thanks to the solid essentials of the gameplay.
  Positive
The main essential is, of course, combat.
  Positive
Resident Evil Revelation 's gunplay just feels really good.
  Positive
Even with my earliest, weakest weapons, the shambling hordes of the undead actually reacted to being shot, so I knew I was causing damage.
  Negative
Headshots and hitting other weak points brought enemies down faster; I felt rewarded for thinking my actions through and playing strategically.
  Negative
You can also expand your options through skills that you purchase with gems scattered throughout each area.
  Negative
New finisher moves for Barry and Claire were essential unlocks, while I struggled to get a handle on other upgrades, such as one that caused my shots to do more damage if I fired while crouching.
  Negative
In a single playthrough, I unlocked less than half of all the skills available, so there are almost certainly other cool strategies I completely missed.
  Negative
In addition to developing your character's abilities, you can equip each individual gun with mods that you discover in locked chests throughout the levels.
  Positive
Many of these are fairly mundane  more damage, faster reload times, etc.
  Negative
but some really fun, weird options start showing up later in the game.
  Positive
For example, I found a charge mod that allowed me to hold down the shoot button to build up a more powerful shot ala Mega Man.
  Negative
Or there's the burst mod, which let my gun shoot two bullets at once.
  Neutral
Pricing isn't something we generally take into consideration for Polygon reviews, and we're not here.
  Negative
But if you're considering jumping into Resident Evil Revelations , it's worth taking note of Capcom's bizarre, multi-version pricing scheme available.
  Negative
Resident Evil Revelation 's four episodes can each be purchased digitally for .

Paying .

  Neutral
Why the bump in price?
  Negative
The Complete Season comes with two not-very-good bonus episodes, which are themselves available for .
  Negative
apiece.
  Neutral
It also includes a bonus character in raid mode.
  Negative
If that's all too confusing, you can just buy a retail disc version of the full game ... for .
  Negative
.
  Neutral
For the extra , the retail disc nets you one more raid mode character and a four-map "Throwback Map Pack," also for raid mode.
  Negative
It's nice that Capcom gave everyone options, but if I had to recommend one I'd spring for the digital Complete Season pass and forget all the rest of this confusing mess.
  Negative
With all of this emphasis on shooting, old-school Resident Evil fans may be wondering where the horror is and, well ... it's not really here at all.
  Negative
Ammo can be sparse at points, especially given the huge number of enemies you're put against, so resource management is a concern.
  Negative
But this mostly just serves to raise tension.
  Negative
Beyond a few early jump scares, there weren't many moments of pure terror in Revelations .
  Negative
In fact, the scariest moments of the game weren't scary for the right reasons.
  Negative
While playing Resident Evil Revelations  single-player, you have the option to swap from Claire to Moira and Barry to Natalia and vice versa.
  Negative
Moira and Natalia are interesting side characters for one big reason: They cannot use guns.
  Positive
Moira can use her flashlight to blind enemies, opening them up for further attacks from Claire, while Natalia has special powers that let her sense weak points or even find invisible foes.
  Negative
But they cannot use guns.
  Negative
In a game that, when it comes down to it, is all about shooting, that's a really strange choice.
  Negative
And while it doesn't end up mattering much in single-player  you aren't forced to play as any individual character for very long  I found myself profoundly unsatisfied any time I took on the role of Moira or Natalia in cooperative play.
  Negative
Revelations, the sequel features "raid mode," a pure action addition that's all about running and gunning through areas, leveling up your character, and unlocking new bonuses, weapons and other characters to use.
  Negative
Raid mode is, quite frankly, a goddamn blast, the most pure and fun form of the gameplay at the heart of Revelations .
  Positive
And it's packed with an overwhelming amount of stuff to unlock and power up.
  Positive
It's also only available in single-player or local split-screen co-op right now.
  Neutral
Online multiplayer for raid mode was supposed to be available by the time the final episode was released; now Capcom is saying it will be here by the end of March.
  Negative
Whatever the case, the delay sucks and negatively impacts what might be the game's best mode.
  Negative
While it has obvious areas for improvement mdash; its level design, its online functionality, its visuals mdash; Resident Evil Revelations  has a strange sort of confidence in what it's trying to do that the series has needed for some time now.
  Negative
It isn't doing anything new, but that may be precisely why it's able to handle the core gameplay so well.
  Positive
If Capcom has decided that light-horror, high-tension action is the firm and final direction for Resident Evil moving forward, Revelations  at least embraces that and provides a road map for where to take it next.
  Positive
here.
