Castlevania-style roguelike.
  Neutral
But while that pat description may be accurate and frankly pretty enticing on its own, it also belies just how thrilling, addictive and expertly-honed this early access game is.
  Positive
This is normally the bit where I'd lay out the story as a framing device, but frankly there's not much to say.
  Negative
You're a person without a head hell-bent on reclaiming cells for your decomposing body.
  Neutral
That's about it.
  Neutral
Dead Cells, but I can honestly say I'm not missing it.
  Negative
When the action is this fluid and fun, it's hard to pine for a non-existent plot.
  Positive
That action is the real star of the show, and I'm going to struggle to do it justice without just shoving a controller in your hand.
  Positive
Dead Cells somewhat resembles "Metroidvania" games, with sprawling D stages littered with items, secrets behind destructible walls, etc.
  Negative
But you won't be kept out of areas because you haven't unlocked the right tool, a hallmark of the genre.
  Negative
The only thing standing in your way is about a bazillion bloodthirsty enemies.
  Negative
As you weave your way through progressively punishing and ever-changing stages, you'll pick up a dizzying array of weaponry: two main weapons on the face buttons, two more powerful attacks on the triggers that require a bit of time between each use.
  Negative
You'll inevitably swap out weapons as you equip more powerful tools, and this is where Dead Cells really starts to shine.
  Very negative
Your whip does mediocre damage ... unless you hit the enemy with its tip, which means a brutally effective critical attack.
  Negative
One sword does critical damage when your health is below half, which makes for a terrifying, thrilling run.
  Negative
There's a rapier that crits after right after you roll, making for much more mobile combat.
  Positive
Another weapon coats enemies in oil, not so great ... unless you have a fire attack to follow it up.
  Negative
Later, I found weapons that made for diabolical pairs, like, for example, a turret that poisons enemies and a fire grenade that just happens to do bonus damage to poisoned enemies.
  Negative
Those bonuses are randomly assigned, so I was constantly lured away from over-reliance on any one style of attack.
  Negative
And every weapon and tool changed my play style so dramatically that I was constantly learning and evolving.
  Negative
It's such a compelling formula that even after a devastating loss, I was always eager to hop right back in and see what new tools and techniques awaited me.
  Positive
And the losses will be devastating.
  Negative
Death means starting back at square one roguelike, remember?
  Neutral
with everything on your person having vanished into the ether.
  Neutral
There is solace to be had though.
  Negative
As you claim cells from fallen enemies, you can use them to purchase new weapons or upgrade your existing arsenal.
  Negative
That is, assuming, you can keep them until the end of the stage, where your health is refilled and your cells can be redeemed.
  Negative
If you die while you're holding them ... yup, they're gone too.
  Negative
Over time, you'll find that you're able to push just a little bit further into the depths of Dead Cells, where increasingly enticing goodies lie in wait.
  Negative
There are also some special items that allow you to activate shortcuts and skip the early low-yield stages entirely, though doing so often thrusts you into deadly ground that you're woefully unprepared for.
  Negative
That's one of countless trade-offs in Dead Cells.
  Neutral
Will you let go of your necklace that allows triple jumping to get one free death?
  Neutral
Will you open a cursed chest if it means you'll die in one hit until it's lifted?
  Positive
These choices can be agonizing, but they also keep the game from ever feeling stale.
  Negative
There are no such compromises in Dead Cell's presentation, which blends -bit affect with modern, beautiful animation reminiscent of the rotoscoping in the original Prince of Persia.
  Negative
It's something to behold, and helps this already fluid game feel even smoother.
  Very positive
There is, of course, still room for growth in this early version of the game.
  Positive
Some weapons, like the turret and magnet grenade that draws enemies in while electrocuting them, are so powerful that I feel frustrated if I'm not gifted them in a playthrough.
  Negative
Also, the benefits you get from parrying with a shield rarely feel worth the risk of putting yourself in the line of fire.
  Positive
I tend to avoid them entirely.
  Neutral
Also, the randomly generated stages often create weird blind alleys that feel as though they would have a reward at the end, but don't.
  Negative
It would be nice for a little more variety in each level  once you start to recognize every element of them, it scarcely matters the way they're assembled.
  Negative
To be straight with you, I had to really plumb the depths of my critical mind to scrounge up those dings.
  Negative
They are problems, don't get me wrong.
  Negative
They just can't come close to dimming the pleasure of this fast, fluid experience.
  Negative
Dead Cells may be the most fun I've had in a game all year.
  Positive
