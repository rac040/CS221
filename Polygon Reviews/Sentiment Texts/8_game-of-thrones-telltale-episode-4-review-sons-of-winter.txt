primarily during the fourth season of the TV series.
  Neutral
Players take the roles of five different characters: Rodrik Forrester, Lord Forrester's first-born son; Mira Forrester, the eldest daughter; Asher Forrester, the exiled second-born son; Ethan Forrester, the third-born son; and Gared Tuttle, squire to Lord Forrester.
  Negative
In the spirit of the series' multi-perspective plotting, senior editor Ben Kuchera and senior reporter Samit Sarkar engage in a back-and-forth discussion of Episode Four, "Sons of Winter."
  Positive
Score one for the good guys, eh?
  Negative
"Sons of Winter" felt like Telltale cranking a release valve on Game of Thrones, relieving some of the pressure that had been building up over the previous three episodes.
  Negative
Much of that buildup finally begins to pay off in "Sons of Winter," and our beleaguered heroes finally score a few victories in long-stewing confrontations, some great action sequences and, most importantly, a few "oh snap" dialogue moments.
  Positive
That doesn't mean the Forresters are out of the woods yet  not by a long shot.
  Negative
These were relatively small triumphs in the grand scheme of this series, offering players a satisfying but ominous dollop of good news.
  Positive
I say "ominous" not just because we've still got two episodes left, but also because the characters' current situations are still as precarious as they've ever been.
  Negative
Having said that, "Sons of Winter" moved Game of Thrones' story forward more than any of the previous three episodes.
  Positive
In the process, it kept tightening the screws on players, continuing to force them to grapple with issues like friendship and trust.
  Negative
Having learned something about a character, whether friend or foe, do you use that fact against them in order to get ahead?
  Negative
Do you sacrifice your personal relationships for the good of the Forrester family?
  Neutral
Do you dare to call someone's bluff?
  Neutral
I played on the Xbox One, and was frustrated more than once when technical issues kept sound files from playing.
  Neutral
It's hard to keep the momentum up when something amazing happens with next to no sound.
  Negative
That being said ...
This was the episode that I said "screw it" and really went for it with my decisions, and that boldness paid off in many ways.
  Negative
Game of Thrones has always been a world where conversation can be just as deadly as combat, and trying to turn people against each other during a party as Mira can be just as fun as a major battle in any other game.
  Negative
And this is a good time for the story to turn a bit.
  Positive
You can't ask the player to go through the entire season feeling like every character is under the boot of someone else; you have to let the pressure off somewhere, and the few victories here that House Forrester enjoys were a good step in that direction.
  Negative
One of the more frustrating moments happened during a dinner scene, however.
  Negative
I decided to press my luck a certain way, and things went poorly.
  Negative
They went poorly in a shocking, but somewhat interesting manner.
  Negative
It didn't matter, though.
  Negative
I did it "wrong" and the game reset, and I had to play the scene another way to survive.
  Negative
In fact, I had to rely on a fact that the previous scene seemed to contradict; either a character cares about someone else or they don't, but it's strange to see it written one way as "wrong" and the other way as "correct."
  Negative
I get that sometimes you can fail a quick-time event and die, but it was a bummer to play a scene a certain way and be told that it was incorrect until I made another selection.
  Negative
It was the first time I felt really boxed in by the game, and it was a bit disappointing, especially in the middle of such a good episode.
  Negative
It sounds like I made the "right" decisions in that dinner scene, because I thought it was perfect.
  Very positive
The option I chose had a callback to a scene just minutes before, and it was another instance of a character using their wits to manipulate an opponent.
  Negative
That was the best element of the Mira scene you mentioned, which was probably my favorite part of the episode.
  Negative
Mira and Sera against the world, y'all  after all, I did owe her a favor after she snuck me into the party.
  Negative
There's an issue with that King's Landing sequence, though: Mira and the player learn information that the other playable characters don't have access to Mira hasn't yet told her family, as far as we know.
  Negative
This episode doesn't contain any narrative payoff to that discrepancy, but perhaps it will come into play in the future.
  Negative
The Walking Dead, and our heroes' lives still hang in the balance.
  Neutral
The studio does seem to be rewarding boldness, and based on the events of "Sons of Winter," there won't be any half-measures available to players as the story moves toward its eventual climax.
  Positive
The best thing I can say about this episode is that I'm finally over the fact that the characters you know from the show are "safe."
  Positive
Now I care enough about the characters created for the game that I'm fine with the stakes being limited to their fates.
  Positive
We may have been pulled into the game with the idea that it would fun to verbally spar with Cersei and Tyrion, but now I care what happens to the Forresters themselves.
  Negative
The story is picking up steam, and the wait between episodes is becoming even harder to tolerate.
  Positive
Ben: It's going to be fun to see how people feel who pick up the game when all the episodes are out and scream through the whole story in a day or two; the wait helps keep the tension high, and it allows you to really stretch out and feel the changes from episode to episode.
  Positive
It's interesting that this episode came out so close to the last episode of the show, which is one of the best in the series.
  Positive
Game of Thrones as a sort of meta-property is doing very well.
  Positive
here.
