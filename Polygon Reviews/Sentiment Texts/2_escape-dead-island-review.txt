Escape Dead Island is also difficult to explain in that I'm not certain the written word has the capability of communicating what a ghoulish, infuriating, dull, taxing, miserable amount of excrement Deep Silver has managed to squeeze onto a single unsuspecting disc.
  Negative
This is, and I'm fairly certain I'm not exaggerating, the worst game I've ever finished.
  Negative
So if Escape Dead Island isn't a Dead Island game in the sense that we have come to think of that franchise, then what IS it?
  Negative
Well, superficially, it's the story of Cliff Calo, a guy born of privilege determined to sort out rumors of a zombie-infested island and also prove something to his media mogul father.
  Negative
If Cliff's quest to grow up and shake his dad's influence didn't collapse into a jumbled mess under the weight of some flashy but meaningless hallucinations and non sequiturs, it might have been Escape Dead Island's single redeeming feature.
  Negative
Alas, this is not the case.
  Negative
That's what Escape Dead Island is about, but this oddball offshoot can best be defined by what it is not.
  Negative
Escape Dead Island Isn't A Stealth Game: Cliff is very vulnerable, but his "stealth" options boil down to sneaking up behind zombies and stabbing them in the head with a screwdriver with the same animation every time, thankyouverymuch or avoiding them.
  Negative
As it's usually impossible to see which way a zombie is looking until you're too close to do anything about it, the "stealth" boils down to whether a zombie is looking at you or not.
  Negative
Sometimes you can methodically go from zombie to zombie stabbing heads; sometimes that approach is suicide.
  Negative
It's a shot in the dark.
  Neutral
You're also forced into a lot of situations where you have to kill everything in sight, clumsily communicated by, I kid you not, mysterious pillars that emerge from the ground to block the exit.
  Very negative
On a couple of occasions, I stealthed my way into a corner there was no way out of other than fighting an overwhelming horde.
  Negative
Once, I found myself in this position right after a checkpoint, so I couldn't take a different approach to the Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid ending I had painted myself into.
  Positive
My solution?
  Neutral
Glad you asked!
  Neutral
I attempted the scenario two dozen times until the most dangerous enemy got stuck in an animation glitch.
  Negative
There's also an unconscionable amount of backtracking that's not only Dullsville, USA, but also makes the establishing of any sort of stealthy tension impossible.
  Negative
I snuck through the massive airfield the first time; by my fourth journey, I'd resigned myself to just sprinting and hoping for the best.
  Negative
Escape Dead Island Isn't A Survival Horror Game: "So, you're running away a lot, maybe it's survival horror?"
  Negative
Well, that's very optimistic of you, but no, it's not really that either.
  Neutral
There are frequent checkpoints and Cliff's health refills automatically, so there's no resource management, no sense of desperation or urgency.
  Very negative
There are, it's worth noting, medkits to collect, but these simply add a point to your "Max Health," a stat that's difficult to get excited about or even keep track of seeing as the game never relays it to you.
  Negative
Escape Dead Island also provides you with two fairly ineffective guns you can collect in the game, a pistol and shotgun, but ammo isn't exactly scarce.
  Neutral
In fact, if you die more than once at a checkpoint, an unseen force will just leave a few rounds on the ground when you spawn.
  Negative
It's as though the game is saying, "Yeah, sorry, this part isn't balanced at all.
  Negative
Would these bullets help?
  Neutral
I have no idea, I've never played this far."
  Negative
Also not particularly scary: Zombies will neither crawl after you nor follow you down even the smallest of ledges.
  Negative
"Nope, sorry boys, he's gone down a ladder," one zombie shambling a few feet above my head seems to say to his similarly shambling buddy.
  Negative
"We'll never catch him now."
  Neutral
It Isn't An Action Game: With those two options removed, you may assume Escape Dead Island to be an action game, but that's not quite right either.
  Negative
Fighting zombies is never ever fun.
  Negative
Ever.
  Neutral
Combat animation is sluggish, the camera is unhelpful and even the weakest zombies can kill you with a few hits.
  Very negative
But the grimmest examples of Escape Dead Island's failings as an action game come in the final couple of hours, when you're forced into a closed arena with multiple zombies that simultaneously burn you with acid from  yards away with perfect accuracy while their compatriots slice your guts open.
  Negative
After  yes, for-ty attempts at one of these sections, I stumbled upon the strategy that allowed me to eke through: I ran in circles endlessly around the edge of the platform I was on until the zombies accidentally leapt to their deaths.
  Very negative
Those guys must not have gotten the "Ledges  Death" memo.
  Neutral
It's Not Worth Playing for Any Reason Whatsoever: I could bloviate endlessly about the failings of Escape Dead Island.
  Negative
It looks god-awful, even for a last-generation game, with a "graphic novel" style that really boils down to "we didn't put textures on anything."
  Negative
It hard-crashed three times, once in the main menu when I was simply perusing collectibles I had found.
  Negative
It lacks any fast travel, which is hard to read as anything other than a crude attempt at padding out an experience that would be maybe six hours without all the backtracking.
  Negative
here.
