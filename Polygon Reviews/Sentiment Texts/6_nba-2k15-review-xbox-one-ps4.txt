A trade proposal unfolds as an actual conversation with another team executive.
  Positive
An opposing coach, standing outside his locker room after the game, calls you over and compliments your -point night  in his own voice.
  Very negative
After taking down a division rival, you can talk smack on Twitter to the player who couldn't stop you.
  Negative
When it comes alive, NBA K is the new frontier of sports video gaming, developing role-playing elements and an online competitiveco-operative mode in ways no other licensed sports title does today.
  Negative
Yet that also exposes the game's greatest weakness: The intoxicating depth of gameplay NBA K offers makes it positively infuriating when some online problem denies you access to it.
  Positive
The NBA K series has always had strong, appealing career modes, but this is the year when playing as a single superstar overtakes the bread-and-butter franchise mode for accessibility and appeal.
  Positive
Straight-up novices can, after about five warm-up games, play NBA K's MyCareer on Pro difficulty the basic level and have a blast without feeling babied by the AI.
  Negative
For players who don't know basketball, there's an option to initiate plays for your team automatically and overlay their diagrams on the floor, telling you where to go and what to do.
  Negative
Likewise, the story that MyCareer tells  an undrafted phenomenon getting his Wonka-ticket shot with a tryout and a -day contract  allows the player to join his favorite club in a couple of narratively authentic ways.
  Negative
For example, if you're a pure shooter and your favorite team is the Golden State Warriors, you can try out for them.
  Negative
Just realize you'll need to throw down in that tryout to get an offer.
  Negative
If they do sign you, you'll need to be nearly perfect in live competition, with gunners like Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry well ahead of you on the depth chart, if you're going to stick around.
  Negative
Or, you could take a tryout with a team with lesser expectations, and better prospects at cracking the starting lineup, shoot the daylights out of the ball, and after proving yourself try to sign with your preferred team in the off-season.
  Neutral
The gameplay itself is greatly helped by a new shooting meter, which is a semicircle underneath the player's feet.
  Positive
It fairly synthesizes the three components of a successful shot in video game basketball: the player's attribute rating, his fatigue, and then the human player's skill at timing the shot.
  Positive
In NBA K, you're given a notch to hit on the meter that widens and narrows with the player's range to the basket.
  Negative
Hitting spot-up jump shots with it is fairly simple at any difficulty level.
  Positive
But shots that come after a lot of motion or shooting against a defender will have a greater variable of success or failure even if you time it perfectly.
  Negative
In sum, shooting feels honest  you can't hit everything just because you have perfect timing, and getting your player open first will make even poorly timed shots go in.
  Negative
On the other side of the ball, NBA K still offers little assistance to those trying to play defense.
  Negative
Effective pressure defense involves moving the right stick which spreads a defender's arms while laying on the left triggerL which activates close defense but even then, your man is likely to spin and scrape you off on a teammate.
  Negative
The floaty movement of players in NBA K also makes it hard to finitely pinpoint your defender where you want him, and when your mark is hauling ass to the basket and you jam the Rtrigger for turbo, you frequently overrun the play.
  Very negative
This defensive confusion is particularly a problem in MyPark, the online streetball mode, where players with high speed and ballhandling ratings can easily fake out lower-rated ballers that are just trying to shadow their man.
  Negative
MyPark is an intriguing competition space but its appeal seems limited to diehards.
  Neutral
Players are asked to pick one of three cities to call home permanently, I should add with specific bonuses granted based on the style of play there.
  Negative
There's a convoluted structure of rivalries with the other parks that plays into how one accrues experience in the Park.
  Negative
This is even if you can get MyPark to function.
  Neutral
Of all online modes, MyPark was the one most bothered by server disconnections and inexplicable bootings through its first week, particularly when you're trying to play with someone from your friends list.
  Negative
Yet even when it does run smoothly, only players who have an active command of specialty ballhandling moves on the gamepad should venture into MyPark, where the competition can be brutal to newcomers.
  Negative
The games are either -on- or -on-, placing a premium on one-on-one play over passing, setting picks or shot creation.
  Negative
You can upgrade your player's moves with "dunk packages," but they cost VC or "virtual currency."
  Negative
As the player you bring to MyPark is the same guy you're balling with in MyCareer, it's more likely you're spending whatever VC you freely earn on basic attributes as you make your name in the NBA, not flashy moves that by themselves offer no performance boost.
  Negative
There's also social pressure to buy distinct clothes for your player, another way NBA K makes its real-world money.
  Negative
You can bring an otherwise awesome player in MyCareer into MyPark and feel completely underpowered and even under-dressed next to others who have clearly spent money on their avatar.
  Negative
For most users, the Lord-of-the-Flies competition and balky online support make MyPark a disappointment so far, despite the promise it holds.
  Negative
That's not to say that MyCareer is the same kind of vehicle making money off of a player's sense of exceptionalism.
  Negative
It is very, very rare when a sports video game makes you play wholeheartedly for an AI teammate, much less make a career decision for one.
  Positive
Yet the ferment of gameplay and narrative in NBA K's MyCareer really does bring that out.
  Negative
Just like Jeremy Lin for the New York Knicks two years ago, my created star burst out of anonymity and into the league, playing his way into the Phoenix Suns' starting lineup from just a -day contract.
  Negative
As Phoenix steamed toward an unlikely playoff berth, my sleazebag agent started scheming about how we'd approach free agency in the offseason, and the big payday that would mean for us both.
  Negative
I egged him on with my replies.
  Negative
Markieff Morris, the Suns' - forward, found text-message evidence of this treachery when my player left his mobile phone unlocked in the locker room before a critical game against Oklahoma City.
  Negative
Morris and co-captain Goran Dragic confronted him in the tunnel.
  Negative
The press got wind of the showdown and everything blew up into a huge scandal on Twitter.
  Negative
Fast forward to the end of the season, after losing in the opening round of the playoffs to Golden State.
  Negative
I'm sitting here, with my PS gamepad in hand, and I have a contract offer from the Charlotte Hornets  that team is my only true professional sports love.
  Negative
Yet I'm remembering how, after Morris and Dragic called me out in the tunnel, we went out and wiped the floor with Oklahoma City to clinch our playoff berth.
  Negative
I'm remembering how I blocked cover superstar Kevin Durant in transition, then fed Morris on the fast break for a dunk as the crowd went nuts and he did a rain dance backward.
  Negative
I'm not embroidering any of this; it all took place in the video game.
  Negative
NBA K was already a polished and and engrossing sports series.
  Positive
With NBA K, it's the biggest soap opera on your console.
  Negative
That's for better and for worse.
  Negative
MyCareer is one of three major gameplay modes that depend on an online connection, for how they're required to store data in the cloud.
  Negative
Fortunately, MyGM  in which you control an entire team and make franchise management decisions  has been uncoupled from this online obligation, which practically caused a scandal in NBA K. Thus, when NBA K's servers are overwhelmed or offline, the real-world drama begins.
  Negative
K Sports has created an online status page to give some transparency to this, but it doesn't change the fact that one of the game's principal career modes, if not its best one overall, requires an online connection even when every game in it is played offline against the computer.
  Neutral
K Sports has been apologizing for its online instability going back to .
  Negative
Every year K Sports promises improvement in online support, and every year it seems this game faces the same woes for weeks after release.
  Positive
A patch has been submitted that will supposedly address some of the problems in MyPark, in which players are booted completely out of the game back to their console's dashboard.
  Negative
MyCareer corrected an earlier problem in which a player's face even scanned and other biographical data would be lost upon returning from a server outage, but there still are reports of lost data  including Virtual Currency balances.Whether and whenever this stabilizes, the simple fact remains that huge chunks of the game's experience are at the mercy of something beyond the user's control.
  Negative
MyCareer, the lifestylesuperstar mode that distinguishes NBA K from all other sports series, is the most accessible it's ever been, to players of all skill levels.
  Negative
MyPark, for those patient and talented enough, is an ambitious attempt to indulge the gunfighter fantasy of being the baddest man on the blacktop.
  Positive
And the game is wrapped in the most intelligent and responsive broadcast presentation you will see in any sports title, down to the halftime interviews real-life players recorded themselves.
  Positive
If the guts of the game are available, NBA K is the best sports title of the year, by a New York mile.
  Positive
The design choices at its edges  either needlessly making offline features dependent on online access, or insufficiently supporting the dedicated online modes  stain what is otherwise a role model for all sports video games.
  Negative
here.
