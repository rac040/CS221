Ys : Lacrimosa of Dana is to completely ignore everything about its title.
  Negative
Ys is a long-running action-RPG series from Japan, but chances are, if youve ever played one, you dont need this review telling you all about it.
  Negative
And Lacrimosa of Dana?
  Neutral
What are these nonsense words?
  Neutral
Trust me: It doesnt matter.
  Neutral
The baffling name doesnt mean anything until deep into the game, and it shouldnt scare you off.
  Negative
Everything about the Ys  package screams that its an incredibly niche game, something only the most hardcore fans of Japanese role-playing games can enjoy.
  Positive
But the reality couldnt be further from that.
  Negative
Though full of anime-tinted high drama that may put off some players, Lacrimosa of Dana is one of the tightest-designed action-RPGs Ive ever played, a game that elevates the series to a stellar new level in everything but name.
  Positive
Ys s opening sees series protagonist Adol Christin and his best buddy Dogi on a ship sailing to their next adventure.
  Neutral
The ship is attacked by a massive sea creature, and Adol finds himself washed ashore on a mysterious island.
  Negative
Although Lacrimosa of Dana is situated at a specific place in the series timeline, with occasional references to past and future games, it requires no real knowledge of the plot so far.
  Negative
Like most games in the series, its a stand-alone adventure.
  Neutral
However, Ys  sets itself apart from previous Ys games  and indeed, from the Japanese RPG genre as a whole  with a unique setup.
  Neutral
Getting stranded on an island isnt necessarily a new idea in RPGs, but at most it usually serves as a brief setpiece in a lengthy journey.
  Negative
In Lacrimosa of Dana, the island is the full game, and every inch of Adols quest is about struggling for survival and searching for a way to escape.
  Negative
Adol isnt on the island long before he starts running into other survivors from the large cruise ship he was on.
  Negative
These ragtag travelers form a community known as Castaway Village, and its up to Adol and a handful of other combat-ready allies to make sure it thrives by gathering materials, finding more shipwrecked pals and slowly mapping out the massive, mysterious island.
  Negative
Survival isnt as easy a proposition as it seems at first.
  Negative
Adol and his friends quickly discover that the island of Seiren holds many secrets  most pressingly, its home to a huge number of dinosaurs or ancient species, as the game refers to them that should be extinct and that dont appear pleased to have had their quiet home disturbed.
  Positive
As Adol and crew explore, they collect materials such as wood, ore and meat that are fed back into Castaway Village, and used to resolve villagers requests and strengthen defenses for the inevitable dino attacks.
  Negative
The more you put into taking care of Castaway Village, the happier the residents will be, and the more youll get back from them in return.
  Positive
Ys: Memories of Celceta; its a fairly standard hack-and-slash setup, but youre rewarded for perfectly timed blocks, dodges and skill attacks.
  Negative
Its speedy, fun, just challenging enough and very rewarding to master.
  Very positive
The combat isnt what makes Ys  special, though.
  Positive
Rather, its the added lightly strategic layer of having to always worry about defending your village, about finding gifts to increase the happiness of your fellow castaways, about finding more castaways so you can clear out a boulder blocking progress on one side of the island and so on.
  Negative
Virtually every moment in the game presents a half dozen different directions Adol could go in, a smattering of goals to choose from  each of which either open up other goals or offer rewards that can immediately make his party more powerful.
  Negative
Ys  doesnt just work on this structural level, but also in the moment to moment.
  Negative
Adol and the five other playable characters in the game just feel good to move.
  Positive
You can swap between all six playable characters on the fly, and  between three of them at the press of a single button.
  Negative
That allows for simple, quick battle tactics, like switching to a ranged character to take down flying enemies.
  Negative
Even the slowest party member  a chunky lush of a fisherman named Sahad  can roll around nimbly in combat, and the party as a whole gains further exploration abilities by way of adventure gear.
  Negative
The adventure gear ends up being another incredibly smart and compelling chain in Ys s game design.
  Positive
Each piece of gear provides a different benefit, such as lighting up dark areas, allowing you to climb vines, letting you breathe underwater or my personal favorite letting you double-jump.
  Positive
Every time you discover a new piece of adventure gear, new portions of the map open up for exploration, allowing you to fill in more of the island and find fresh treasures or survivors.
  Positive
This element isnt new to the Ys series, but more so than in any previous title it makes Lacrimosa of Dana feel like an action-RPG spin on Metroid.
  Negative
Its brilliant.
  Very positive
The only thing about Ys  that isnt brilliant is its story, and even that is a bland but forgivable distraction at worst and a genuinely entertaining adventure in its best moments.
  Positive
As is the way with Japanese RPGs, Lacrimosa of Danas sparse narrative eventually expands to include an ancient civilization, a character with a bad case of amnesia and a surprise threat to the world that Adol and his friends must contend with in addition to finding a way off of Seiren.
  Negative
Ys  mostly handles this plot fine  there arent too many overlong cutscenes until the very end  but there were definitely moments when I wanted to get back to the action rather than listen to the main characters fret over what to do next.
  Negative
The best moments of the game focus on the mismatched townspeople of Castaway Village itself.
  Positive
Theyre mostly a collection of anime tropes, but theyre cliches that feel well-executed.
  Negative
Each member of the community has a largely self-contained, satisfying character arc, and if you work with them and follow each plot thread to completion, the game provides a real sense of how the experience of being stranded on the island has changed them.
  Positive
Also, you get to solve a murder mystery at one point, and thats pretty rad.
  Negative
My biggest concern about the writing in Ys   and this is an issue for the series going forward as well  is that it feels like at least some of its occasional inanity may stem from the translation.
  Negative
Since s excellent Ys: The Oath in Felghana, Xseed Games has handled localization duties for the franchise.
  Negative
NIS America takes over publishing the Ys series in North America with Lacrimosa of Dana, and though I have not played the game in Japanese and cannot comment on the actual accuracy of the translation, I feel comfortable saying that this entry features many more extremely awkward and half-baked lines than the last few.
  Negative
Story has never been the pull of the Ys franchise for me, though, and if youre not yet familiar with the series, its not why you should give this game a chance.
  Negative
And make no mistake: You should give Ys : Lacrimosa of Dana a chance.
  Negative
Developer Nihon Falcom has always been talented, but this project represents a new high for the studio, a game where each piece comes together and interlocks in a way that feels damn near perfect.
  Positive
Dont let the obscure name fool you; forgettable story aside, this is one of the best action-RPGs of this generation.
  Negative
