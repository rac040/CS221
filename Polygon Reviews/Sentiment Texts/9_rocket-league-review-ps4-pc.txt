The concept is easy to grasp: You have to use futuristic cars to knock a ball into a goal.
  Negative
You can jump into the air to hit the ball with your car, you can use a finite amount of boost to speed up, and theres a handbrake to allow for tighter turns.
  Positive
Thats it.
  Neutral
You can see everything the game has to offer in minutes.
  Positive
The amount of complexity that comes from those simple commands and rules may be infinite, however.
  Positive
Its not just a matter of learning how to hit the ball with you car, but understanding how to angle your car to aim the ball, while controlling your momentum to make sure youre in position to help your team.
  Negative
This is the genius of Rocket Leagues design: It introduces a well-known concept and then adds a complication.
  Positive
Soccer, or football for our international readers, is a sport played by human beings who can stop on a dime and turn in any direction; our bipedal design allows us to deal with the sport in a very efficient manner.
  Positive
Rocket League forces you to deal with the turning radius of your car, and that changes everything.
  Negative
You have to know how to get in front of the moving ball, while pointed in the right direction with the proper amount of momentum to take a shot at the goal or to knock the ball away from your own goal.
  Negative
What seems like a fun, arcade-style sport game quickly ascends into a world of angles, throttle and reversals, a realm where every action must be  carefully planned.
  Negative
When I first picked up the game, I felt as if I was driving a monster truck; as I practiced and improved I learned to turn it into a scalpel.
  Positive
Its the mixture of chaos and precision that makes Rocket League so much fun.
  Positive
Some rounds consist of well-tuned teams with a good variety of defense and offense players working together, only going airborne when they need to hit the ball.
  Negative
Other rounds turn into a brawl, with the ball and cars flying this way and that, without much regard for accuracy.
  Negative
There are two gambles you can make in Rocket League: You can either bet on your own skills, or the other teams incompetence.

  Negative
Rocket League offers a wide variety of options for camera placement and movement, including a toggle that either focuses on your car or the ball.
  Positive
You can even adjust the field of view via a slider, a rarity in console games.
  Positive
It may seem like a trivial thing, but so much of the game depends on how you see the field and acting quickly on that information.
  Negative
I was able to spend about  minutes tweaking options to get a view that felt a bit more comfortable than the default, and its great to be given that option.
  Positive
Rocket Leagues game modes are as pared down yet essential as its controls.
  Negative
You can duel with another player in one-on-one matches or play team games with up to four players per side.
  Negative
The complexity and intensity ramps up as you add players, and larger games demand more thought and effort behind each point scored.

  Negative
Rocket League has a persistent scoring and leveling system, like most modern online games.
  Positive

  Positive
The refreshing thing is that these points and levels are only good for cosmetic options.

  Negative
A player with  hours of practice is going to be better due to the skills they picked up, not the gear theyve earned.
  Negative
This is not to say that Rocket Leagues bots are terrible.
  Negative
Theyre efficient and capable, and they tend to dominate in an annoying way if a human player drops out of an online match.
  Negative
The bots are rarely confused about whats going on, nor do they ever completely bungle their shots, whereas human players can be found out of position, suffering from communication issues or messing up their own teammates shots.
  Very negative
That near-perfection is why playing against bots never really feels like the real thing.
  Negative
Again, banking on the errors of the other team can be just as helpful as betting on your own competence.
  Negative
Bots are machines, and they act like it.
  Neutral
Rocket Leagues combination of skill-based gameplay, the chaos of live competition and the internally consistent physics creates a game thats almost overwhelming emotionally.
