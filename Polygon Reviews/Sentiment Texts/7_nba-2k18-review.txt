NBA K might play brilliantly, but its off-the-court issues get in the way of its success.
  Negative
The game delivers a tremendous simulation of the sport, with sparkling presentation to match and a renewed focus on the inner-city origins that many NBA athletes share.
  Very positive
Then developer Visual Concepts takes this otherwise stellar game on a detour toward microtransactions.
  Negative
The NBA K series has been on this path for years, but its emphasis on microtransactions reaches a new peak in NBA K.
  Negative
It often feels like the better pieces of the game  of which there are plenty  get lost in its obsession with squeezing more money out of its players.
  Negative
change NBA Ks cover after a blockbuster trade put its cover athlete in a different uniform.
  Negative
To better capture that growing disarray in the leagues offices, NBA K introduces a story to its franchise mode, MyGM.
  Negative
A player  your created MyPlayer, specifically  suffers a career-ending knee injury and later takes up the reins as general manager.
  Negative
Trade Kyrie Irving away or put him at a different position; thats the crux of a team GM gig, with a hint of occasional internal team drama involved.
  Negative
Its a stretch to call it a story mode as the menu does, but minor expansions to MyGM include dialogue exchanges and player interactions new to NBA K.
Madden NFL s Longshot or even previous years of NBA K. For instance, DJs agent isnt much of one, but he does have a catchphrase: Eat what you kill.
  Negative
The characters dont seem to understand what that means and they say so, but NBA K runs with it for the humor.
  Negative
When playing as DJ, youll encounter NBA Ks The Neighborhood.
  Negative
Consider it a hub of activity for DJs career.
  Negative
In a MMO-lite twist, its possible to walk around with numerous hundreds, maybe, if servers fill up of other player-controlled DJs, playing pickup games, trading scores in minigames or socializing.
  Negative
The presence of other players is generally pointless outside of light competition, however; I ended up just ignoring the crowd.
  Very negative
I soon realized The Neighborhood just replaces NBA Ks core menu.
  Negative
In that sense, its merely a clumsy way to navigate.
  Negative
Want a haircut?
  Neutral
Walk the block to the barbershop.
  Positive
Want to change clothes?
  Neutral
Go home first.
  Neutral
Need new shoes?
  Neutral
Jog down to Foot Locker.
  Negative
Looking to catch a quick pickup game?
  Neutral
The court is down the street on your left.
  Negative
Plodding as this navigation is, theres a touch of personality and culture inside.
  Negative
At the barbershop, DJ is served like a local celebrity while they chat about general gossip.
  Negative
The friendly if sleepy attendant of a food cart brings in some laughs.
  Positive
These spaces are also nicely decorated, cramped and flush with old brick buildings circa s New York.
  Negative
Its a strong representation of the impoverished to lower-middle-class upbringing of NBA stars who got their start in places like Harlems Rucker Park.
  Neutral
However, The Neighborhood is also sullied by corporate sponsors.
  Neutral
A bit of gentrification in the old neighborhood?
  Neutral
Maybe.
  Neutral
But its not only a Foot Locker location sitting on a corner or Gatorade-sponsored gyms.
  Negative
The owners of the barbershop present DJ with a gift, JBL headphones, of which DJ chimes in, Are these the new JBLs?
  Positive
Gatorade is a central piece of the story, called out by the broadcast team during games as much as it is advertised during gym training sessions buying virtual bottles of Gatorade for stamina includes a spiel about electrolytes.
  Negative
Selling a bit of ad space  even overdone ad space  isnt inherently problematic.
  Negative
Its emblematic of an online-connected era.
  Neutral
Theres an authenticity in rotating courtside banners and between-play chatter by the announcers, changing as the year moves on with new sponsors cycling in.
  Negative
The insistence on using Virtual Currency VC for everything compounds the issue, though.
  Negative
NBA K wants you to drink Gatorade, but its also interested in getting you to spend more real money in the game.
  Negative
VC has exploded into an infestation over the years, and its a powerful lure.
  Positive
Buying special editions of NBA K grants bonus VC, an attractive proposition considering that player upgrades, new hairstyles, clothes and shoes require currency.
  Negative
Spending VC on shoes means less VC to upgrade DJ, and less opportunity to hold your own in pickup or Pro-Am modes against real-world competition.
  Negative
The slog to earn currency without spending real money is inexcusable; shoes run , VC and one player category upgrade asks for , VC, but you only earn about  VC in the average game.
  Negative
The poking and prodding from VC-related pop-up offers when booting up a new K session irritates further.
  Negative
The microtransactions can be ignored, at least, when in franchise mode, one of the few parts of NBA K where VC is not available.
  Negative
On the court, various tweaks continue to improve NBA Ks simulation of basketball.
  Neutral
Shots use a sharp new timing meter, and in NBA K, the difference between open and contested shots is appropriately significant.
  Positive
Any defenders hand in the vicinity is likely to send a jumper off course.
  Negative
At default settings, new AI tweaks allow the opposing offense to maintain possession organically, using the shot clock to work the ball around.
  Negative
Not only does this look natural, but the days of playing only six-minute quarters for realistic results have passed.
  Negative
I stuck to nine to  minutes per quarter to produce realistic scores at default settings, inching closer to the full  minutes of a real game.
  Negative
To further add to the sense of realism, NBA K is absolutely gorgeous in motion.
  Positive
Even excluding the stellar HDR support, tweaks to character models and textures bring out myriad small details.
  Negative
Beards look better than anywhere else.
  Neutral
Plus, a new production package is in place this year, from pregame national anthems to hilarious bits from the studio team of Ernie Johnson, Shaquille ONeal and Kenny Smith.
  Positive
The groups character models need a do-over, but their interactions remain natural.
  Negative
Game commentary brings over some familiar lines Kevin Harlan returns yet continues to progress with guest commentators from Kobe Bryant to  dunk contest champ Brent Barry.
  Negative
Of course, its no surprise that NBA K looks good; the series has looked the part since its advent on the Dreamcast, staying relevant visually and staking out its own part of basketball culture.
  Negative
NBA K continues the trend, capturing the feel of basketballs urban centers in The Neighborhood.
  Positive
Its too bad, then, that The Neighborhood is covered in ads and persistent microtransaction begging.
  Negative
The growing push to spend real dollars on VC impacts those looking to build even the most basic of player avatars.
  Negative
Its too much in NBA K, holding back nearly every mode and customization option.
  Negative
VC is an unavoidable truth.
  Neutral
But on the court  especially in the excellent franchise mode, free from the grasp of microtransactions  NBA K lives up to its predecessors and at times even bests them.
  Negative
