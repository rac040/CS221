Were in uncharted territory with Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare.
  Neutral
I derided it as being one of the worst installments in Call of Duty history.
  Negative
downvoted videos in YouTube history, the end result is something far more interesting than anyone would have guessed  at least in its campaign.
  Positive
Call of Dutys recent forays into future warfare make this new journey into the outer reaches of our solar system kind of a no-brainer, but despite the setting, Infinite Warfares campaign is something of a return to basics.
  Neutral
The waves of AI and VR ridiculousness of Black Ops s campaign have been abandoned in favor of a simple story about one core concept: whether the mission is more important than the lives under ones command.
  Negative
Its a question that might have seemed too heavy for previous games in the franchise; even some of the best Black Ops and Advanced Warfare, for example struggled with depth and, at most, had few standout characters.
  Negative
Infinite Warfare, on the other hand, offers the strongest writing and characters the series has seen thus far.
  Positive
A measure of narrative strength and success is whether you can remember a characters name, or whether you care if they die.
  Positive
And I cared.
  Positive
A lot.
  Neutral
I havent cared this much since Gaz and the gang from the first Modern Warfare were summarily executed in that campaigns closing seconds.
  Negative
And why did I care?
  Negative
Infinite Warfares cast is fleshed out.
  Positive
Theyre believable characters with personalities and motivations, characters I wanted to see make it out safe and sound.
  Positive
Not all of them do.
  Neutral
The storys only real weak point?
  Negative
A spot of celebrity stunt casting in Kit Harington Game of Thrones Jon Snow.
  Positive
Unlike your shipmates, Haringtons Admiral Kotch is flat and uninspired, offering shallow platitudes and threats of Martian dominance yes, hes from Mars.
  Negative
His appearances are mercifully few and far between, with the bulk of your time spent jawing with your newfound buddies.
  Negative
Beyond the story, the campaign succeeds on several fronts.
  Positive
The interstellar setting allows for quite a bit of environmental variety, even if the boots-on-the-ground gameplay hasnt changed all that much since the first Black Ops.
  Negative
Standout levels include a trip to Earths moon and a mission that takes place on a rapidly spinning asteroid that makes it seem like theres a -second-long daynight cycle.
  Negative
Planetary variety did wonders to make me feel like I wasnt repeatedly assaulting the same old arctic military base.
  Negative
Another success: ship-to-ship dogfighting.
  Positive
While it lacks the depth of more involved space simulations like TIE Fighter or Freespace, the dogfighting sequences are a great way to add some more variety to the Call of Duty formula.
  Positive
Certain missions have you fighting on a planets surface before jumping into a ship and flying into space to board an enemy starship, complete with out-of-ship zero-gravity sequences, all over the course of just a few minutes.
  Negative
And unlike short vehicle sequences in past games, which felt like cute gimmicks, the ships here feel fully integrated into the overall package.
  Positive
The campaigns overall length is comparable to previous installments, at just over seven hours, but thats padded a bit by another first: side missions.
  Negative
Not to be confused with the groan-inducing survival scenarios in Black Ops , Infinite Warfares short, -minute endeavors offer a mix of infantry-based ship assaults and pure dogfighting sequences.
  Negative
One of the most interesting sequences has you donning an enemy uniform to go undercover and assassinate enemy leadership.
  Positive
You can actually stealth your way through the whole mission, eventually sucking all the air out of the conference room theyre meeting in.
  Negative
All of the side missions have their own little twists to make them feel unique, even if they reuse a lot of assets.
  Positive
I realize that many people skip right past the Call of Duty campaign, only playing a mission here and there while waiting for friends to hop online to play multiplayer.
  Negative
Dont make that mistake with Infinite Warfare.
  Negative
Its an exceptional single-player experience, and the strongest part of what this package has to offer.
  Positive
Unlike its campaign, multiplayer in Infinite Warfare is, well ... safe.
  Positive
The last Call of Duty game that Infinity Ward worked on, Ghosts, messed with a lot of the systems that worked so well in Black Ops .
  Positive
It took risks, shifting from the simple and elegant Pick  system to something far more convoluted.
  Negative
It also suffered from technical and balance issues.
  Negative
This year, it feels a bit like the developer decided to take its biggest risks in the campaign, while playing it very safe on the multiplayer front.
  Negative
If you played Black Ops , the multiplayer in Infinite Warfare is damn near identical.
  Negative
Movement feels the same, with boost jumps and wall-running returning.
  Positive
Character abilities work the same as well, although this time theyre locked to specialized rigs that come with a selectable super and passive ability.
  Negative
Some of the perks have been switched around, and the killstreaks are a little more space-oriented  laser bombardments instead of explosives, for example  but for the most part, this is Black Ops  multiplayer with new maps and some bells and whistles tied on.
  Very negative
One of those bells is a new system called Mission Teams.
  Positive
Before each match, youre able to select one of three random objectives.
  Negative
These objectives are determined by your chosen team.
  Negative
The first team you unlock is the easiest, with objectives focused on getting kills with guns or abilities.
  Negative
As you level up, youll unlock new teams with more varied and challenging objectives.
  Negative
Why does this work?
  Negative
Finally theres a reason to finish a match.
  Neutral
Call of Duty has a bit of a reputation for being brutal on newcomers, and if youre losing by a boatload, you may feel like youre just throwing yourself into a meat grinder over and over again.
  Very negative
With Mission Teams you have something to work for, even if the match is a total loss.
  Negative
Completing these mini-objectives will level up your Mission Teams and eventually unlock skins and new guns that are exclusive to that team.
  Negative
Its a nice addition for more casual players who want to feel like theyre actually making progress without destroying the flow for everyone else.
  Positive
Mission Teams arent the only way to unlock new guns.
  Negative
The belovedhated supply drops of Black Ops  are back in Infinite Warfare, with an added twist: salvage.
  Positive
In the previous iteration of supply drops, you were at the whimsy of luck when you were trying to get a specific gun to drop.
  Negative
Now, with salvage earned when opening supply drops, completing missions and finding duplicate items, you can save up your resources to unlock specific gun variants.
  Negative
The end result: Even if you have the worst luck in the world and the gun youre pushing for never drops, youll eventually have enough salvage to buy it outright.
  Negative
Sadly, there are still guns that will unlock only from supply drops, but eventually they will become craftable as well, as new guns get added.
  Negative
Its an interesting system that allows for yet another form of progression, though I do have balance concerns.
  Positive
Unlocking some of the epic-tier guns without spending any money beyond the  or more you already shelled out could take weeks or even months.
  Negative
That feels like those who pay will have an advantage over those who dont, at least at launch.
  Negative
Infinity Wards diligence on gun balancing is really the X-factor here, and right now we just have to hope the studio will keep things fair.
  Negative
Even if youre not into the randomness of supply drops and the time sink of salvage collecting, theres still plenty to work for in Infinite Warfare.
  Negative
The series is peerless when it comes to customization, and there are dozens of gun skins, emblems and player banners to customize your character with.
  Negative
Every gun, perk and piece of equipment has its own challenges and unlocks, leaving true obsessives with a good years worth of stuff to keep them busy.
  Positive
Its a relief to see that Call of Duty hasnt strayed from these tenets of constant progression and reward when other franchises, like this years otherwise excellent Battlefield , have pared back massively on this front.
  Negative
Infinity Wards contributions to the core gameplay introduced in Black Ops  are welcome, even if they feel additive rather than revolutionary.
  Negative
Its fair to say that if you found last years multiplayer to be to your liking, youll get the same level of enjoyment out of this years multiplayer.
  Negative
Thats assuming you can stomach another full year of what is essentially the same game with a few minor upgrades.
  Negative
Like its multiplayer mode, Zombies in Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare seems to lean heavily on Treyarchs pre-established formula.
  Negative
Four random heroes are gathered together in a zany environment and must do a series of increasingly obscure tasks to unlock a mysterious Easter egg.
  Negative
This years installment is set in the s, with archetypes like the Valley girl, the nerd, the jock and the, uh, rapper is this even an archetype?
  Negative
, attempting to survive in a zombie-filled amusement park.
  Neutral
The fundamentals are identical to just about every other Zombies map weve seen thus far, but several concessions have been made to encourage those who have been scared off by the modes notorious difficulty.
  Negative
For one thing, its actually pretty easy to survive, at least to wave , without knowing anything.
  Positive
Exploration is also pretty straightforward, with maps to guide you around and sections of the park being themed "Come to the rocket ship!"
  Positive
or "Were in the arcade!"
  Neutral
for easy identification.
  Neutral
The mode also tells you a lot more about what you should be doing.
  Positive
Treyarchs Zombies maps are known for being stingy with guidance.
  Negative
Here, though, there are numerous help screens and tooltips.
  Negative
One of the pickups you can stumble upon is a sack of jelly beans.
  Negative
Throw some on the ground and nothing happens.
  Negative
In a previous game you might have thought, "Oh well, maybe I have to save these for later?"
  Neutral
Here youre actually told to shoot the candy to set it ablaze, creating a temporary barrier to ward off zombies.
  Negative
Its not exactly holding your hand, but its not completely tight-lipped either.
  Negative
Well call it quasi-helpful.
  Neutral
Another bone thrown to the player is that weapon experience and attachments in multiplayer actually carry over to Zombies.
  Negative
If youve unlocked a silencer in multiplayer and have that specific weapon unlocked in Zombies, itll come packed with that attachment when you buy it off a wall.
  Negative
Its similar to the system in Black Ops , but again is a little friendlier and more generous, a running theme in this mode.
  Negative
Theres no doubt that Infinity Ward made a wise call in ditching the Ghosts franchise.
  Negative
Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare offers one of the best campaigns the series has provided, with stellar writing and varied environments.
  Positive
While that level of ingenuity didnt transfer over to multiplayer and Zombies, taken as an entire package, Infinite Warfare is a standout effort whose biggest sin is not trying to reinvent the wheel at every turn.
  Negative
here.
  Neutral
After spending a week on live servers, Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare seems to behaving ... mostly.
  Negative
Intermittent lag compensation issues have plagued certain multiplayer matches games for me, resulting in near-instant, unfair deaths.
  Negative
All Call of Duty games have suffered from this to some extent, but the issue seems particularly pronounced in Infinite Warfare.
  Negative
Hardcore modes help to mitigate it until the problem is addressed, but it's an issue that's keeping multiplayer from reaching the heights that Black Ops  did.
  Negative
A larger problem, involving major frame-rate issues on the Xbox One version of the game in Zombies mode, was fixed in a patch late last week.
  Negative
As such, we're removing the provisional flag from our review, and the score is unchanged.
  Negative
