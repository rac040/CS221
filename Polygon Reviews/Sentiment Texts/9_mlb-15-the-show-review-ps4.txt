MLB  The Show developer Sony San Diego makes greatness look effortless.
  Positive
Few of the new elements this year are dazzling departures from the series' previous games.
  Very positive
The studio's renewed focus on iterating on the existing core, instead of coming up with showy new features, is emblematic of its relentless dedication to refinement.
  Negative
Nearly every part of the game has received some attention, with notable improvements in some key areas.
  Positive
MLB  is buoyed by subtle upgrades that combine to paper over a few lingering deficiencies and uphold the franchise's stellar track record.
  Negative
MLB  The Show introduced two major features, Quick Counts and Player Lock, that drastically reduced the length of an average game.
  Negative
But last year's interminable load times on PlayStation  negated the time-saving additions.
  Negative
Load times are mercifully much shorter in MLB   an improvement that's particularly meaningful in a sports title, where you're constantly jumping in and out of games.
  Negative
MLB  offers an entirely new method of swinging the bat that I loved immediately: directional hitting.
  Positive
You move the left stick during a swing to try to influence a hit in a particular direction left side, right side, fly ball, ground ball.
  Negative
Directional hitting is a great riskreward mechanic, amplifying your chances if you get a pitch where you're looking and reducing them if you don't.
  Negative
In directional hitting, the hitting camera shifts toward the direction in which you're aiming.
  Negative
This makes it easier to read pitches in the area, helping you determine whether they'll be strikes or balls, and makes it tougher to get a bead on pitches elsewhere.
  Negative
Directional hitting is a smart addition as an intermediate setting that will help players graduate from the simple timing-based hitting to the challenging zone hitting option, where you must move the bat to the ball's location.
  Negative
Sony San Diego made a meaningful change to pitching as well as batting.
  Positive
The new pitch trail is a wonderful tweak to the pitching interface, indicating exactly where a pitch with movement should end up in or out of the strike zone.
  Positive
This is much clearer than the nebulous old system of chevrons illustrating the general direction and degree of a pitch's break.
  Negative
It also provides a clear differentiation between pitchers of varying skill levels, and gives you the Platonic ideal of every pitch for each hurler.
  Very positive
This dovetails nicely with Sony San Diego's tweaks to fielding.
  Positive
The studio greatly reduced the magnetic attraction between a fly ball's landing spot and a fielder.
  Negative
This makes the act of catching pop-ups much less automatic than before, putting the onus on you to get your fielder into position at the right time without overrunning the ball.
  Negative
The change has definitely caused me to make more errors in the outfield, which is frustrating.
  Negative
Yet it fits with the increased agency that MLB  gives to fielders.
  Positive
It feels like you have more  control over players in the field, and defensive outcomes feel less preordained as a result.
  Negative
The fields themselves are marvelous.
  Positive
The Show has always rendered these cathedrals of baseball spectacularly, but the addition of a realistic daynight cycle, and sun positioning that's aligned with the time of year, shows off the ballparks in a whole new light.
  Positive
The fans within the stadiums do a better job of responding to the situation at hand, too.
  Negative
There's nothing like the feeling of the crowd coming alive as you get set to deliver a two-strike pitch, and hearing the roar when you get the punch-out.
  Negative
This is also reflected with MLB 's emphasis on player emotion  hitting a homer is always a great feeling, but I really got a kick out of seeing the opposing pitcher get pissed off at himself.
  Positive
The audio side of MLB 's presentation doesn't match the visuals.
  Negative
The series' commentary is perennially some of the poorest in any sports title.
  Negative
Matt Vasgersian, Steve Lyons and Eric Karros still speak mostly in generic terms about the action and the players involved, and it rarely feels like there's any interplay between them.
  Very negative
Even with new lines, the commentary remains the worst element of the game and is in dire need of a shake-up.
  Negative
this trade, injuries, milestones and more.
  Neutral
This is the kind of detail I'd love to hear from the in-game commentary.
  Positive
The other changes to Franchise are smart tweaks that make the mode more realistic and engaging.
  Positive
General manager contracts set goals for your club that you must try to accomplish within three seasons.
  Negative
In addition to giving you something to strive for, the goals establish parameters for your management philosophy.
  Positive
Is your team a playoff contender, or rebuilding for the future?
  Negative
MLB 's revamped trade logic means that CPU-controlled clubs act in accordance with their current position.
  Neutral
Some are looking to dump high-paid players and free up their budget, and others are willing to give up prized prospects in an effort to win now.
  Negative
All of this made my virtual league feel more alive.
  Negative
You can increase your Franchise budget by accepting sponsorships from real-life brands like Nike and Rawlings.
  Negative
This is a smart way to integrate those companies, whose official gear appears in The Show for the first time, without it feeling like mere product placement.
  Negative
Equipment is the only noteworthy change this year to Road to the Show, the single-player career mode, allowing you to outfit your player with bats, gloves, cleats, batting gloves and superstitious "ritual" items that raise his attributes.
  Negative
Road to the Show remains my favorite career mode in all of sports gaming, brilliantly enmeshing you in the journey from the amateur draft to the big leagues.
  Positive
While I'm not thrilled that it's essentially unchanged here from MLB , it's still a tremendous experience.
  Positive
MLB  is also the first game in the series to allow you to import your Franchise, Season or Road to the Show experience from the previous year, and the process is smooth as long as you're sticking with the same console.
  Negative
I really appreciated the ability to pick up with my career where I left off in MLB ; this is a feature whose importance can't be overstated for annual buyers.
  Very negative
MLB 's other main mode, Diamond Dynasty, doesn't allow for importing progress, perhaps because it received a much-needed overhaul this year.
  Negative
Sony San Diego greatly simplified what used to be a confusing, convoluted mess of virtual trading cards, contracts, editable fake players and real MLB athletes.
  Negative
You now put together a squad from your collection of MLB player cards.
  Neutral
You can earn additional cards by playing Diamond Dynasty or  through MLB 's new overarching rewards system  any other mode, or buy them with Stubs, the in-game currency.
  Negative
Every time the notification for a new card popped up, it made me want to jump back into Diamond Dynasty to see if I could put the player to good use.
  Negative
My main complaint with the mode is that the games take too long  they're full nine-inning affairs that you can't shorten with Quick Counts or Player Lock, even when you're playing against the CPU.
  Negative
Many Diamond Dynasty games are played online, which has been a death sentence in previous years because of The Show's history of awful online play.
  Negative
That's perhaps the biggest area of improvement in MLB : I'm pleasantly surprised to report that I had no notable problems playing the game online.
  Positive
I did see some isolated instances of weirdness, like improper blending between two animations, but the experience was lag-free even when I was sitting in New York playing a friend in San Francisco.
  Negative
Yasiel Puig, the flamboyant star outfielder for the Los Angeles Dodgers, is the cover athlete for MLB .
  Positive
But his appearance on the cover belies the game inside the box.
  Positive
Sony San Diego eschewed developing splashy back-of-the-box bullet points in favor of refining an already great game, exhibiting a confidence that is itself quietly remarkable  just like this series' consistency.
  Very positive
here.
  Neutral
