After  years, it was time for Pokmon to shake things up.
  Neutral
Pokmon Sun and Moon, the pair that move the series into its seventh generation, serve as not just a refinement, but a reinvention of what the series has gotten right and wrong over the past two decades.
  Positive
Older games have previously altered the series in big ways, adding online multiplayer and convenient shortcuts over the years.
  Negative
Sun and Moon go even further, introducing much-needed adjustments to item management, traveling and battling.
  Negative
The games also buck core elements of the Pokmon formula, like gyms and badges, to create a unique experience.
  Positive
These are risky moves to make for a franchise with so much nostalgia behind it, but they all lead to what is the most memorable Pokmon journey in years.
  Positive
That's evident from the very beginning, which establishes these games as more serious about their story than their predecessors.
  Negative
The classic narrative of collecting 'em all on the way to becoming regional Pokmon League champion is tweaked: The -year-old protagonist, who's just moved in from the original games' land of Kanto, must first complete several trials of skill to prove their worth to the region's strongest trainers.
  Positive
To do so, they must travel across their new home's four isles and become better acquainted with Alola, its people, its Pokmon and its priorities.
  Negative
I was surprised by how taken I was with the story.
  Neutral
Pokmon is rarely a series that prioritizes plot, but Alola is a fascinating new world.
  Positive
Thanks to a small cast, the games encourage you to become close to each character, and relationships with the humans of Alola are meaningful, just like those forged with its Pokmon.
  Positive
I loved building out my own Pokmon team as per usual, but I cared just as much about the fate of my new friends and fellow aspiring Pokmon masters as I followed them closely from town to town, island to island.
  Negative
Pokmon Sun and Moon's revision of the classic "visit a town, beat its gym, move to the next town" set-up is just as striking as their storyline.
  Positive
The island trials that replace traditional gym battles feel like a more personal experience, with each presiding captain getting to know and care about the player and their particular skills.
  Negative
Although there's still a face off against a leader with a type-based team, the path there is diverse and unpredictable, especially for a Pokmon veteran.
  Positive
I found these challenges to be a disorienting change of pace at first.
  Negative
How could I gauge my progress when each island has a different number of captains, and each trial has unique conditions?
  Neutral
What does taking photos of Pokmon have to do with becoming the very best trainer that ever was?
  Neutral
But the trials play a large part in how Sun and Moon reconstructs the Pokmon formula.
  Negative
Their impact on the story is direct, and the diverse gameplay worked in tandem with that story.
  Positive
This isn't to suggest that Sun and Moon ignore the most important part of any Pokmon game, however.
  Negative
There are plenty of battles to be fought, whether in the wild or the new Battle Royal feature, against friends and seasoned Alolan champs.
  Negative
This is an excellent thing, because I've never loved fighting Pokmon more than I do this generation.
  Very positive
Part of that is because of Sun and Moons fantastic presentation: These are beautiful games, some framerate dips during more spectacular battles aside.
  Positive
But the most affecting change made to the series here is a great quality of life improvement.
  Very positive
A type effectiveness indicator bakes into the gameplay what I've had to regularly look up on my own since I first played Pokmon Red in .
  Positive
After facing off against a Pokmon once, the game automatically charts whether a move will be effective or not.
  Negative
This is fantastic for newcomers, but it's also a relief for people like me who have had to juggle the specifics of an increasing number of Pokmon types over the year.
  Positive
The effectiveness indicator is joined by a "call for help" mechanic, where wild Pokmon under duress will cry out for an assist from another Pokmon with varying success.
  Negative
These additions make the sometimes tedious random battles way less so.
  Negative
I used to be someone who avoided tall grass unless I was hunting for a certain Pokmon, because battles could often become a grind.
  Negative
In Sun and Moon, it's much easier to develop a battle strategy on the fly.
  Negative
That means that a one-on-one fight turning into two-on-one at a moment's notice is a welcome challenge, not a point of anxiety.
  Negative
The Alola region's diverse ecosystem makes random battles even more exciting.
  Negative
It also is a boon for collectors.
  Negative
The importance of crafting a strong Pokmon crew to take to victory in battle isn't lost on Sun and Moon, and that's apparent in the story, too: The main prize of the island trials is no longer badges, but a set of high-powered gems called Z-Crystals.
  Negative
They're a way more useful reward, as any Pokmon can use the Z-Crystal that corresponds to the type of one of its moves.
  Negative
Unlike the more limited selection of overpowered Mega stones in the previous generation games Pokmon X and Y, anyone can use a Z-Crystal and is encouraged to do so.
  Negative
They're flashy and they're fun to use, even if the benefit isn't as great as it's made out to be.
  Positive
The multiplayer offerings in Sun and Moon are mostly carried over from X and Y and Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire.
  Negative
Wonder Trade and the Global Trade System return for some easy Pokmon swapping, and there's also various battle options.
  Negative
The new Festival Plaza feature that houses all of the online options feels a little congested  it's both a hub for battles and trades and a place to get in some single-player competitive training.
  Negative
Expect international strangers to stop by at random, although there's not a ton to do with them beyond hoping they accept a multiplayer request.
  Neutral
As for squaring off against friends, Sun and Moon are not exempt from Nintendo's archaic online friends list system.
  Negative
It's probably less stressful and tedious to set up a multiplayer session in person than one that's silently beholden to an internet connection, where my fellow player and I were hit with weird errors and lag.
  Negative
New features include the Battle Royal mode, which is basically just a multiplayer free-for-all, and global missions, which are a fairly dull set of timed activities where you can earn points while doing laps around the Festival Plaza.
  Negative
Pokmon veterans already know what their needs are when it comes to online, but those stopping in for the first time won't find these options that exciting.
  Negative
Flashy and fun is Pokmon Sun and Moon's modus operandi, and I found it to be an impressive, successful combo.
  Positive
But much of the spectacle is derived from the very linear storyline, which doesn't bode well for the games' longevity after the plot comes to a close.
  Negative
Sun and Moon trades expanded content for a straight, if well-told, adventure, marking yet another deviation from the Pokmon series formula.
  Negative
I found myself even more disappointed by this exchange than I otherwise would be, largely due to fond memories of robust side quests in previous generation games.
  Negative
The sparseness of the Alola region reflects this change in priorities.
  Negative
Beautiful as the setting may be, there's not a whole lot to do on these islands beyond completing the trials and finding Pokmon.
  Positive
There are ways to keep busy outside of besting the island captains and collecting all -plus Pokmon, but they're few and farther between.
  Negative
There's even a marker on the map that tells you exactly where to go in Alola at all times, a new element that points to just how straightforward Sun and Moon are compared to previous entries.
  Negative
Where older games encouraged exploration, the games just wanted me to keep moving forward and not look back.
  Negative
In my travels, I found little to unearth in Alola outside of where the story was pointing me toward, and that's a disappointing change.
  Negative
There are few side quests to get lost in, both during or outside of the storyline.
  Negative
Dedicated completionists and battle pros will discover a lot to love from the new fights that open up after the story's done, but I'm left wanting more ways to just hang out with my Pokmon, both during and after the main game.
  Negative
Pokmon's th anniversary year has been all about celebrating what's great about the series, but the newest pair of games prove that the series is ready and able to make big changes without sacrificing that original spirit.
  Positive
Without the heaps of content of series-defining entries like Red, Silver and X, Sun and Moon don't quite stand as endlessly replayable classics, but they're a wonderful testament to why Pokmon is still so special all these years later.
  Positive
here.
  Neutral
