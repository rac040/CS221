Day of the Tentacle Remastered seeks to travel back to a time when adventure games were at their height, and manages to hit that mark.
  Positive
Mostly.
  Neutral
The purest entry in the growing catalog of LucasArts remasters, Day of the Tentacle has been updated by developer Double Fine with all of its charm and characteristic clever puzzles and liberal use of humor.
  Positive
Day of the Tentacle Remastered truly feels like a labor of love.
  Neutral
Unfortunately, a new coat of paint provides some much-needed gloss, but can't quite hide some poor pacing and confusing puzzle design.
  Negative
The sequel to the seminal adventure game Maniac Mansion, Day of the Tentacle concerns itself with a mutant, sludge-eating purple tentacle's dastardly plot to take over the world.
  Negative
The game drops players in the shoes of three protagonists: the nebbish geek Bernard, the laid-back Hoagie and the spaced-out Laverne.
  Negative
With the help of mad scientist Dr. Fred, they set course for yesterday in their half time machine, half porta-potty Chron-O-John when disaster strikes.
  Negative
Hoagie is trapped  years in the past and Laverne  years in the future, while Bernard lands back in the present.
  Negative
This setup gives Day of the Tentacle plenty of chances for complex puzzles alongside humorous callbacks and call-forwards.
  Positive
The game is set in a single location, the Maniac Mansion of its predecessor.
  Neutral
But each character must explore the mansion in their respective time period.
  Positive
Characters rely on each other more often than they did in Maniac Mansion, and that cooperation makes the adventure seem grander than ever.
  Negative
Broken Age.
  Neutral
The solutions to Day of the Tentacle's puzzles are wonderful  attaching a battery to Ben Franklin's kite so that a lighting bolt recharges it; decorating a mummy so it will win a "human show"; drying a sweater for hundreds of years so it shrinks to the right size.
  Positive
But the paths toward them are less than elegant.
  Positive
Day of the Tentacle isn't great at guiding players toward solutions, and it's easy to grab objects you won't need until much further down the line on another character.
  Negative
It grinds the game to a halt, even an adventure game.
  Positive
Day of the Tentacle Remastered manages to shine considerably more in the 'remastered' area.
  Positive
The transition from pixel art to something more hand-drawn is striking, as backgrounds transform into bright and joyful cartoon landscapes.
  Very positive
Spot-on character designs bring the cast to new life, and cleaned-up dialogue recordings and a new, non-MIDI soundtrack are highly appreciated as well.
  Positive
Day of the Tentacle Remastered takes great care to give the player a sense of the game's historical worth with a large library of unlockable concept art and a very competent developer's commentary track; this helps place the game in a proper context.
  Positive
The ability to jump between the classic game and the remaster at any time preserves the original while highlighting its improvements.
  Positive
However, Day of the Tentacle Remastered's most functional changes involve alterations to the user interface and experience that make the game easier to play.
  Neutral
The original version cluttered the screen with a list of verbs and inventory items.
  Negative
Remastered borrows a page from later LucasArts games like Sam and Max Hit the Road, handling actions with a pop-up wheel full of options.
  Negative
This more modern interface gives Day of the Tentacle Remastered more room to breathe, and it makes for swifter navigation and interaction.
  Positive
This edit is an important one, as Day of the Tentacle's charm wanes far more quickly than that of other LucasArts titles.
  Negative
Not all pieces of the game are equal.
  Negative
Bernard's aimless wandering in the present can't compete with Hoagie's interactions with the Founding Fathers, while Laverne's sedate mannerisms undercut the charm of her puzzle solutions.
  Negative
The game starts strong, but its momentum takes a noticeable hit toward the middle.
  Positive
An extended sequence of back-and-forth jumping between Bernard and Laverne offers a painful and dispirited stretch of gameplay, though Day of the Tentacle finds some of its initial magic again in time for the finale.
  Negative
Some of Day of the Tentacle Remastered's brightest moments are spent entirely away from puzzles, in chatting with the game's characters.
  Negative
The dialogue is snappy, and visual gags are at a premium  time traveling can shift environments or even explain how they got to be that way to begin with.
  Positive
But Day of the Tentacle often pushes hard on jokes that don't quite land.
  Negative
This is most prominent in a puzzle involving left-handed and right-handed hammers, which only manages lukewarm laughs thanks to some physical humor.
  Very negative
A gag about the rights to Maniac Mansion ends up becoming the cornerstone of a puzzle that's too self-referential for its own good.
  Negative
In these instances, the cartoon logic grows a little too ludicrous, and more than a bit tiresome.
  Negative
Day of the Tentacle Remastered provides a wonderfully crafted recreation of the original game, and Double Fine's streamlining of some of its rougher edges makes it a more approachable experience for modern audiences.
  Positive
But its revisions only go so deep, and can't quite manage to elevate source material that elicits chuckles rather than the riotous giggle fits it clearly expects.
  Negative
here.
