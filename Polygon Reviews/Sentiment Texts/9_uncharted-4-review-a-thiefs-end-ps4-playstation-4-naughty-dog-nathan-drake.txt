Uncharted : A Thief's End, I never wanted to set foot into an ancient tomb or long-lost treasure trove with Nathan Drake again.
  Negative
Uncharted series, and should serve as a benchmark for other franchises approaching their twilight years.
  Negative
There are no threads left unresolved, no relationships left unexplored and no shirts left partially untucked.
  Negative
It's as cathartic an ending as you could hope for, and then some.
  Negative
But that catharsis is built around a game that's so much more intimate and  shockingly  quiet than the other Uncharted adventures.
  Positive
The memorable, exploding setpieces the series is known for are sparsely used in Uncharted .
  Positive
Past games tossed Nathan Drake into a capsized boat or a crashing cargo plane, but in this final chapter, he's subjected to a far more dangerous ordeal: a thorough exploration of the fact that he can, at times, be kind of an asshole.
  Negative
Uncharted .
  Neutral
The chemistry between the two characters, fostered by returning actors Nolan North and Emily Rose, is the best it's ever been.
  Very positive
They're both given countless opportunities to do stellar character work, and every scene they share carries a lovely, hilarious, heartbreaking emotional payload.
  Positive
Nate's retirement is interrupted by the return of his brother Sam, a former accomplice who was seemingly killed while on a job  years prior.
  Negative
Sam's life is in danger, he explains, and the only way he can be saved is if he and Nate pick up that job where they left off.
  Negative
Nate acquiesces, and, under questionable pretenses, sets off on his final adventure.
  Negative
Uncharted  has the most cogent campaign of the series.
  Neutral
There are no warlords seeking ancient weapons of mass destruction, no sunken cities with immortal mutant guardians  there's just the lost pirate colony of Libertalia and a literal boatload of treasure hidden within.
  Very negative
It's a straightforward bounty, but it's refreshingly grounded, focusing more on the parties chasing Libertalia than some mystical MacGuffin waiting at the end of their quest.
  Positive
Uncharted  is a game about the high cost of obsession.
  Neutral
Everyone, from the pirate founders of Libertalia, to the first explorers who died hunting it down, to the game's current-day heroes and villains, is subject to the oppressive weight of their own unchecked ambition.
  Very negative
As cautionary tales go, it's pretty nuanced, and a surprising turn from the franchise's earlier entries, which treated Nathan Drake's unquenchable thirst for adventure and glory as something resembling a superpower.
  Positive
That ambition manifests in different ways.
  Positive
For the wealthy and ruthless Rafe Adler, it's a desire to prove his worth beyond his inheritance.
  Negative
For the mercenary leader Nadine Ross, it's the duty to satisfy a client and rescue her company from collapse.
  Negative
For Captain Henry Avery  a founder of Libertalia  it's the pursuit of redemption, as inspired Saint Dismas, the "Penitent Thief" present at Jesus' crucifixion.
  Negative
The constant specter of ambition makes every character in Uncharted   even the old pirate kings who died centuries ago, whose plights are detailed through copious journal entries  relatable.
  Negative
But it's also what makes Nathan Drake such a fascinating character in this, his final quest: His ambition isn't nearly as explicit as everyone else's.
  Positive
He's there to save his brother, sure, but there's something else pulling him along; something toxic, something that causes him to make terrible decisions with terrible consequences.
  Negative
It's something that made me wonder if, just maybe, the Nathan Drake I've seen in this series is actually Nathan Drake at his worst.
  Negative
Speaking of: Uncharted  still sees Drake mow down a few dozen platoons of nameless mercenaries throughout its campaign.
  Negative
That combat is totally serviceable  it's reminiscent of Uncharted 's blend of stealth takedowns and cover-based gunplay, but with more fluid movement to allow you to weave between cover points more easily.
  Neutral
But it's still the least interesting thing about the game; fortunately, battles are fewer and farther between this time around, and even the most climactic fights feel way less protracted than the exhausting stop-and-pop shootouts of Uncharteds past.
  Negative
Of course, if Uncharted 's gunfights weigh you down, you can spice them up with the game's biggest mechanical addition: a grappling hook you can attach to specific points.
  Negative
Most arenas have at least one grappling point you can latch onto, allowing you to swing to higher ground or simply blast foes while suspended from the ceiling like a piata.
  Negative
It's dumb and dangerous, but it's inarguably more fun than engaging in battle on terra firma.
  Positive
My time with Uncharted 's online multiplayer component was limited to a few hours of matches in a pre-release session, but I really enjoyed what I had a chance to play.
  Positive
It's reminiscent of the run-and-gun competitive modes from the previous games, but with a larger emphasis on teamwork and survival.
  Negative
Taking too much damage puts you in a downed state, which a nearby teammate can revive you from, keeping the opposing squad from scoring off of your death.
  Negative
That's not exactly a new concept, but it's enough to organically force players in Uncharted 's multiplayer to stick together while leaping, climbing and  thanks to the addition of the new grappling hook  swinging all around the map, attempting to flank their opponents and gain higher ground.
  Negative
Loadouts are also deeper this time around, giving you more ways to outfox your enemies, support your teammates or go lone wolf, supported by summonable AI soldiers and powerful, supernatural Mysticals.
  Positive
Those boons have to be purchased with in-game currency, which you'll earn based on your performance and by hurrying to the treasures that spawn all around the map, giving you further impetus to always stay on the move.
  Positive
It was extremely easy to pick up on Uncharted 's multiplayer component; within a few matches I was scoring big for my team, sneaking behind enemy lines with a covert cliffside approach or risky head-on grappling swing.
  Very negative
With a bevy of unlockable loadout options and aesthetic upgrades, as well as plans for DLC that you'll be able to purchase solely with in-game currency, it seems like the tracks have been laid for the game's competitive side to have a pretty long tail.
  Negative
The grappling hook also adds some much-needed variety to climbing.
  Positive
Swinging on a grapple point affords Drake a free range of motion, allowing you to leap to  or completely over  distant perches with superhuman magnetism.
  Negative
The Last of Us' ubiquitous floating pallets  under a ledge that's just out of reach.
  Negative
Uncharted 's cliffside train wreck  but the overall pacing of Uncharted  fares much better than its somewhat uneven predecessors.
  Negative
But it wasn't the promise of bigger, more dangerous explosions that pulled me through Uncharted 's campaign, which I completed ravenously over a two-day binge.
  Negative
It was a desire for Nathan Drake to just be done with it all: the killing, the lying, the recklessness, the selfish pursuit of fortune and glory.
  Negative
And that desire wasn't just me projecting my feelings onto a video game character  it's the arc that Drake and Uncharted  follow unswervingly.
  Negative
There is nothing cheap about how Naughty Dog has decided to retire this franchise  no door is left open for a crass surprise sequel  and there's nothing ambiguous about its resolution.
  Negative
Every other Uncharted game has, to varying degrees, posed a question  "can a thief be good?"
  Negative
and summarily moved on without wagering a guess.
  Positive
In finding an answer, Uncharted 's story soars, and presents a moving, fulfilling finale.
  Positive
here.
  Neutral
