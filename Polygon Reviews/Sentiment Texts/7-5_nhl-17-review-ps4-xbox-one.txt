NHL  makes a few major strides, but it cant manage a giant leap.
  Negative
Theres more to do in NHL  than in perhaps any previous entry in the franchise.
  Neutral
Along with adding new modes, developer EA Vancouver has expanded on existing options in both breadth and depth; hockey fans of all stripes are likely to find something here that will pull them in.
  Positive
Thats a baseline expectation these days in simulation sports games, but NHL  goes above and beyond with features like a quick, draft-based mode thats inspired by similar offerings in Madden and FIFA.
  Positive
last year.
  Neutral
Despite a grand overhaul to the stagnant Be a GM mode and a major expansion to EA Sports Hockey League, NHL s growth is held in check by a persistent staleness, as well as some frustrating issues both in and out of the rink.
  Negative
The most notable and impactful change on the ice is the return of net battles, in which attackers and defenders can jockey for position in front of the goal.
  Negative
I still have to remind myself that the feature actually exists in NHL , since its been gone for three years, but it pays dividends in ways besides making the game look more like real hockey.
  Positive
I let out a triumphant yelp the first time I evaded a defenseman just in time to deflect a teammates slap shot past the goalie.
  Negative
Regardless of whether you use net battles, the CPU certainly will  the AI is happy to tie up your forwards and lift their sticks, preventing them from receiving passes in scoring position.
  Positive
EA Vancouver never should have removed net battles, but in adding them back in, the developer has made the feature deeper, with options for both defenders and attackers.
  Negative
Now that bigger forwards can use their size to their advantage and park themselves in front of the net, I saw many more deflected goals.
  Positive
Deflections always have an element of "right place, right time" to them, but in the past, those goals felt entirely random  a person happened to be in position when an outside shot came in.
  Neutral
In NHL , I found myself taking slap shots from the point and attempting to aim them at an area where a teammate engaged in a net battle might be able to deflect the puck in.
  Negative
Just as some old gameplay problems remain present in NHL , the Be a Pro mode returns this year almost unchanged.
  Negative
The single-player career mode hasnt received any notable upgrades this year.
  Positive
Be a Pro is due for an overhaul, especially considering the storytelling elements that competitors like NBA K and now FIFA are incorporating into their career modes.
  Negative
For a start, it would be nice to see some more intelligent coaching AI.
  Positive
I started out with my major junior team on the first forward line, and quickly became the best player in the Western Hockey League.
  Negative
Yet my coach sometimes kept me on the bench for  minutes  half a period!
  Negative
between shifts.
  Neutral
And if youre losing late in a close game, AI coaches may pull the goalie, but Ive never seen one call a timeout.
  Negative
Smart hockey coaches take timeouts so their top line can catch its breath and get back on the ice for crunch time.
  Positive
But if I got tired late in the third period, Id end up sitting out until the final horn.
  Negative
Its somewhat understandable for Be a Pro to have been neglected this year, considering the transformation of Be a GM into Franchise mode.
  Negative
The new name is justified by the introduction of managing finances beyond your players salaries.
  Positive
In addition to putting together a winning roster by dealing with personnel concerns like injuries, player morale and a minor league affiliate, youll have to keep your owner satisfied by turning a profit.
  Negative
Each teams owner has a different personality and level of expectations depending on the clubs current situation, like "rebuilding" or "contender."
  Positive
From there, the owner sets various goals that youll aim to meet in order to keep the executive happy.
  Positive
Your owner gives you a budget that you must allocate to salaries, advertising, promotional nights and arena maintenance.
  Negative
For instance, parts of the building will degrade over the course of the season and youll have to repair them periodically, lest the fans get unhappy with the state of, say, the bathrooms.
  Negative
I wouldnt ordinarily call out a games UI, but the layout of the menus in NHL s Franchise is one of the modes greatest strengths.
  Positive
Since youre making so many financial decisions  like setting prices for tickets, concessions and more  its great that the interface provides data to help you make those changes, such as fan feedback on the pricing and graphs of your teams sales performance versus that of the entire league.
  Negative
I just wish it would notify you of situations that affect pricing, like the fact that you can and should raise ticket prices as your team advances through the playoffs.
  Negative
Franchises "Fan Happiness" metric, which takes into account arena maintenance as well as your teams performance, doesnt work as well.
  Negative
In my first year as general manager of the Buffalo Sabres  a team classified as being in "rebuilding" mode, meaning that my owner didnt expect the club to make the playoffs  I won the Stanley Cup.
  Negative
I spent my entire arena budget before the playoffs even began, so the restrooms and even the seats themselves were falling into disrepair by years end.
  Negative
But it makes little sense that the fans elation at their team winning the Cup would be dampened much by subpar stadium facilities.
  Negative
If youre tired of the fans nonsense, you can try relocating your team to one of more than two dozen North American cities.
  Negative
Aside from the inherent thrill of bringing an NHL club back to a town that formerly had one, like Quebec City, Quebec, or Hartford, Connecticut, the fun of relocation comes in building a rink from scratch using NHL s robust arena creator.
  Negative
The only constraint to your imagination is, as always, your budget.
  Positive
I tend to spend most of my sports gaming time in career modes, but NHL s Franchise is so good that I expect itll hold my interest more than Be a Pro this year.
  Positive
apparent bug in which I didnt get credit  neither for the win nor my gaudy stats in the game  for completing an EASHL quick match.
  Negative
I discovered this the hard way.
  Neutral
The premise of Draft Champions sounds fun: Put together a team through  rounds of randomized players.
  Positive
But the games compressed range of player ratings  another long-standing issue for the NHL series  means that unlike in Madden, youre almost guaranteed to get a very good squad, which severely lowers the stakes.
  Positive
Frank Gehrys trophy instead of Lord Stanleys.
  Neutral
That reuse captures NHL  in a nutshell.
  Positive
In places like the revamped Franchise mode and the improved EA Sports Hockey League, the game is full of promising new elements that are held back by a number of nagging issues.
  Positive
In others, like Be a Pro, the lack of change is more pervasive.
  Negative
Despite the major additions and upgrades in NHL , a sense of stagnation threatens the considerable progress that the series has made in three years on current consoles.
  Negative
Without an unqualified success in NHL , I felt that ever more keenly this year.
  Positive
here.
  Neutral
