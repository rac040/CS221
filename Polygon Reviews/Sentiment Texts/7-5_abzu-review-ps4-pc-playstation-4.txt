Abzu, it's getting harder to write game reviews and not just because I have to frequently check the spelling of the title.
  Negative
In the last  years, the vocabulary we use when we talk about games has had to expand exponentially, creating new semantic nooks and crannies for titles that are less traditional game and more experiences or narratives.
  Negative
Games have had to evolve too, as they became more experimental, constantly playing with which mechanics support storytelling and aesthetic beauty, and which just get in the way.
  Negative
Abzu developer Giant Squid is belligerent about the latter, never letting mechanics impede the joy of underwater exploration, and, if you'll pardon the pun, it may have gone a bit off the deep end.
  Very negative
Journey but underwater."
  Neutral
That's an easy comparison, convenient to the point of being trite, but it's a useful jumping-off point  or diving-off point?
  Negative
In Abzu, you are an unspeaking protagonist who only interacts with the world via sonic pings.
  Negative
Story isn't explicitly conveyed, but rather alluded to in the environment.
  Negative
Also like Journey, Abzu can be completed in a couple of hours.
  Negative
The game's pedigree makes the comparison even more sound.
  Neutral
Its creative director is Matt Nava, Journey's art director.
  Negative
The games also share a composer, Austin Wintory.
  Positive
There are, however, plenty of important divergences.
  Positive
The world of Journey was so solitary that the occasional presence of a second player felt like an oasis.
  Positive
Abzu, however, is literally teeming with life.
  Negative
Manta rays glide lazily past the player; massive schools of fish swim in dizzying cyclones; dolphins play and flit circles around the solitary diver.
  Negative
There's not a square foot of this ocean that doesn't pulse with beautiful, colorful life.
  Negative
It's the main draw of the game, and frankly, just experiencing this world is enough to recommend Abzu.
  Positive
Did I mention you can grab a dolphin's fin and ride it?
  Negative
Because you totally can.
  Positive
The highlights of Abzu are several sequences where the diver is scooped up by a rushing current and sent careening through the ocean.
  Negative
The combination of Wintory's soaring yet melancholically whimsical score and the lavishly colored groups of fish, dolphins and whales that swim by your side make for a thrilling spectacle that would seem at home in a Miyazaki film.
  Negative
No matter how visually or symphonically rich these sequences may be, they're robbed of a bit of intensity by the fact that they ask for little input from the player.
  Negative
Journey was never hard, per se, but it required a bit of proficiency to keep the action moving.
  Positive
The threat of making a mistake provided an intensity and, by extension, emotional investment that Abzu never quite reaches.
  Negative
Even when you're exploring freely, there's little going on mechanically.
  Negative
You'll swim through nearly the whole game, only stopping on land for a few brief moments.
  Negative
You'll find small robots you can use to open doors.
  Negative
There are mines that can be easily avoided, and only slow you down a bit if you fail to do so.
  Negative
There are a couple of switches to flip, though calling them puzzles would be a profound overstatement.
  Neutral
Speaking from a purely mechanical perspective, Abzu is profoundly unengaging.
  Negative
As I've said, the astounding presentation fills much of that gap, but not completely.
  Neutral
It's not buoyed much by the narrative, which is so abstract I've played the thing twice and still have only the vaguest idea of who the diver is or what she is doing.
  Negative
There are hieroglyphs throughout the ocean that should fill in the blanks, but I'll have to rely on players smarter than me to fully explain their meaning.
  Negative
Your character does have a surprisingly affecting relationship with a great white shark, but it's not nearly enough to emotionally ground the game.
  Neutral
Abzu asks so little of the player mechanically that it feels like we are more witness than participant.
  Negative
If we have a counterpart to "background music" in games, it is Abzu.
  Negative
It invites you to let your mind wander and be swept away by its aesthetics while making precious few demands of your conscious mind.
  Positive
This is, if you will, a background game, and a supremely chill one to boot.
  Positive
Abzu literally lets you press a button to meditate in specific locations, which translates to just watching fish swim around and occasionally eat one another.
  Neutral
It's profoundly relaxing, but does little to make the player feel more connected to the game as a whole.
  Neutral
Exploring and playing in Abzu's oceans is a gorgeous, soothing experience that's easy to recommend.
  Positive
We have precious few games that strive for placidity and even fewer that reach it as handily as Giant Squid has here.
  Negative
But for all its aesthetic wonder, Abzu's threadbare mechanics feel like they're keeping the player at arm's length.
  Negative
For a game that's all about plumbing the depths, it's just a little shallow.
  Negative
here.
  Neutral
