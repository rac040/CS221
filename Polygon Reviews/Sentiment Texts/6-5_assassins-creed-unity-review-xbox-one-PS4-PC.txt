Assassin's Creed Unity has the weight of a console transition lying heavily upon it.
  Neutral
As of Nov. , , there will have been eight main Assassin's Creed games since , including Assassin's Creed Unity.
  Negative
The series has seen annualized releases since , along with a willingness to experiment that other series haven't.
  Positive
But it's also increasingly lost sight of its primary design sensibilities  social stealth, target acquisition and single, spectacular kills.
  Negative
Unity is poised to change that.
  Neutral
Assassin's Creed : Black Flag may have been the first AC game on the new consoles, but it was a cross-generational port.
  Negative
With the new-gen-only Unity, main developer Ubisoft Montreal is taking the series back to its roots while bringing online co-op and social functionality to Assassin's Creed proper.
  Negative
In many ways, Assassin's Creed Unity suggests where the franchise can go with cooperative play and exciting, more fully realized worlds.
  Negative
But Unity feels like nothing so much as a meal taken out of the oven too soon.
  Negative
Assassin's Creed Unity begins in late-th-century France.
  Neutral
As the country sits on the precipice of revolution, Assassins and Templars play puppet master over both sides of the conflict in an effort to ...
I'm not sure, actually.
  Negative
I've been a fan of Assassin's Creed's narrative and fiction since the series started in , an apologist even, but I'll admit to feeling more lost than not as I played through Assassin's Creed Unity.
  Negative
Main character Arno has a backstory that establishes his attachment to the Assassins, but it isn't clear why he's involved with them.
  Negative
Arno isn't interested in the Assassins' greater mission.
  Negative
Instead, he's unraveling a murder mystery that also happens to involve a nebulous "evil" conspiracy.
  Negative
It's only ever clear that both the Assassins and Templars are caught up in the back-and-forth politics of their era, and that neither are effective in their plans.
  Negative
Ultimately, the end of the game goes out of its way to tell you how little any of Unity's story matters.
  Negative
Even the modern-day meta-narrative element is at an all-time low, save for the aforementioned "oh, never mind" it saddles Unity with.
  Negative
It discards the excellent fourth-wall-poking Abstergo Studios direction of Black Flag for the flimsiest of contrivances to get the game moving.
  Positive
It does at least provide for a decent reason to divert Unity's otherwise th-century setting into some bizarre, time-warping directions here and there, but otherwise, it doesn't have a lot of reason for being here.
  Negative
More than possibly any Assassin's Creed game before it, Unity's plot seems contrived primarily as a way to thrust Arno into an action adventure game taking place in as many different important places and times within the French Revolution as possible.
  Negative
In that, at least, Unity is successful.
  Positive
Unity is laser-focused on Paris as it was and came to be over the course of the revolution, and that is a story it tells more effectively.
  Positive
This is assisted by one of the most astonishingly realized settings I've seen in a game.
  Negative
Assassin's Creed Unity is often jaw-droppingly beautiful, filling its virtual Paris with light, with intimidating recreations of real-world landmarks and, most obviously, with people.
  Positive
The streets of Unity's Paris are legitimately teeming with people  people who are gathering in angry mobs, standing to hear revolutionary tracts read on corners, fighting with the monarchy's forces and often running from those conflicts.
  Negative
In many ways Arno feels more like a witness to the rebirth of a country, of its national identity.
  Negative
This isn't ground games typically tread, and I really enjoyed Unity's exploration of such a complicated and messy transformation.
  Positive
This focus on Paris alone with an occasional side trip to Versailles carries over to the game world's structure.
  Positive
Buildings now are often much more than facades to be climbed on  many structures feature fully realized interiors to be explored as well.
  Negative
This extends to many of the major landmarks of Paris, such as the Palais de Justice and Notre Dame cathedral.
  Negative
The transition to a more organic sense of place and more involved world signifies a change in much of Assassin's Creed Unity's mission structure from previous games.
  Positive
Arno's assignments and goals are typically specific targets that involve penetrating a fortified structure.
  Negative
Unity has a more stealth-oriented posture, and it's for the better.
  Negative
Finding weaknesses in a building's perimeter, discovering holes in security and attempting to capitalize on these things for a "clean" kill on my targets made for a stronger, more satisfying and rewarding core loop than Assassin's Creed has seen for some time.
  Negative
A major part of that reward comes from an increase in enemy lethality.
  Positive
Enemies in Unity will cut you down quickly if you give them the chance, and guns are even more lethal.
  Negative
Combat has been redone, with a counter system with less margin for error and enemies that will leave you less space to focus on one enemy in a group unmolested.
  Negative
Arno can't walk the streets of Paris unafraid of all opposition  I was taken out in short order by random street thugs or guards that saw something I'd rather they hadn't more than once.
  Negative
Stealth is almost always the best option and, honestly, the one that left me feeling more cool when it succeeded.
  Positive
Arno's basic physical competency is better than his forebears, which helps.
  Negative
A sweeping overhaul of the series' animation systems leads to much more graceful transitions from one action to another.
  Positive
Traversal has been somewhat simplified  holding the right trigger engages free run as usual, with the A button activating upward motion and the B button tilting Arno down.
  Negative
This is a literal lifesaver coming from previous games: now, to get down from a tall structure, you need only hold forward and B and pick your path, which will generally put Arno on "safe" footing in his descent.
  Negative
This greatly reduced the incidences of me accidentally jumping carelessly to my death as a result of the game misreading my input intentions or me misreading a structure's pathing.
  Negative
But many of the same problems that have plagued the series for years remain.
  Negative
Arno's feet can get tangled in random environmental bits  my most mortal enemy was the occasional randomly situated chair, in case you were wondering.
  Negative
Arno often stares dumbfoundedly at waist-high obstacles if you don't hit them at a run, which is particularly annoying given the massive emphasis on building interiors.
  Negative
Granted, there's a lot of crap piled on the streets of Paris as well, impromptu barricades reflecting the revolutionary fervor sweeping the city.
  Negative
The only thing they seemed to stop was my forward progress.
  Negative
There are also new culprits added to the mix that filled my controller-throwing meter.
  Positive
Windows are a particular menace, especially egregious given how often Unity demands you use them.
  Negative
The only time I could reliably go into a window was at a full run  picking my way inside while hanging from a wall, whether to the right or left, above or below, was almost enough to make me give up the stealth route and walk in through the front door.
  Negative
It's not just that these problems exist.
  Negative
It's that every Assassin's Creed game has had them for so long that I can't remember not dealing with them.
  Negative
And while each Assassin's Creed has moved farther away from the core of the series, whether that's in exploring a wilderness, assembling a brotherhood, sailing a ship or even dabbling in tower defense, Assassin's Creed Unity's re-narrowed focus on a single city and vertical traversal makes these navigation problems even less acceptable.
  Negative
Unity relies more on its basic mechanics than any game in the series since , and it buckles under the pressure.
  Negative
Assassin's Creed Unity buckles in other ways, making for the least stable, worst-performing major release I've played this year.
  Negative
Its moment-to-moment performance varies between acceptable and abysmal, falling toward the latter entirely too often with a frame rate I'd ballpark in the teens somewhere or, rarely, the single digits.
  Negative
Worse, I experience a number of hard crashes on the Xbox One version provided for review, and I fell through the ground into formless oblivion seven or eight times in my -ish hours with the game.
  Negative
Load times are also prohibitively long, often taking a minute or more.
  Negative
All of this adds up to a game whose technical issues often make it more difficult to play.
  Positive
Assassin's Creed Unity isn't as frame rate-sensitive as a shooter like Call of Duty, but navigating the world when the game was struggling to respond to my inputs felt like a chore.
  Negative
Unity finds some saving grace in its broader social aspects and cooperative multiplayer.
  Positive
There are clubs to create or join in order to work with other players to accomplish broader metagame objectives, which in turn reward you with additional progression in the main game.
  Negative
This is invaluable, as Assassin's Creed Unity has a more rigid gating of abilities.
  Negative
There's also a more involved gear system than previous games, with multiple tiers and kinds of armor for each body part, each tailored to a different play style.
  Positive
I tended to favor items that augmented my stealth capabilities, making me harder to spot and letting me lose myself in crowds faster.
  Negative
This personalization manifests in co-op play.
  Neutral
Up to four players can join together and wander Paris, but your group can only complete specific cooperative missions.
  Negative
The most surprising thing about co-op is that it works, and running around as a gang of assassins in a sprawling th-century city is one of the more distinctive cooperative experiences I've had.
  Positive
But pay attention to the mission difficulty ratings  many of the more advanced assignments in Assassin's Creed Unity clearly seemed designed for four players, with powerful, deadly enemies arranged to avert stealth approaches for all but the most prepared groups.
  Negative
