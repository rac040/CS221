I went into Dream Daddy hoping that it would be good, but not necessarily believing it.
  Negative
I want what Dream Daddy is selling: a romance game about queer dads that love each other and love their kids.
  Positive
It doesnt necessarily approach this construct with the nuance and hard edges that are present for real-life queer single dads.

Its a pretty cool accomplishment for a silly game birthed from a meme.
