In a genre dominated by big-budget console titles, most games attach to something familiar  a team logo, a broadcast announcer, a stadium  to create a bond with the player.
  Positive
Super Mega Baseball binds the player to the sport itself.
  Negative
It's an arcade-style sports title, with cartoonish players and mirthful touches.
  Negative
In its core, though, is one of the most thoughtful and balanced sports games I've ever played, "arcade" or "sim," licensed or not.
  Positive
The imagination that went into this game is most apparent in Super Mega Baseball's pitching system, which elegantly combines the challenges of accuracy and timing as the pitch is being delivered, without resorting to meters, gimmicky gestures or visual information that dominates the screen.
  Positive
It essentially breaks down to finding the proper release point for a pitch, which determines its effectiveness and accuracy in real life, too.
  Negative
Other baseball games take an approach to timing and release point, but Super Mega Baseball's way allows for more of the mistakes  some of them with happy outcomes  that influence a duel with a hitter.
  Positive
It plays out like this: The player steers a drifting reticle toward his target, and releases  as close to the center of that target as possible.
  Negative
The pitch then gets a numerical rating - based on its effectiveness.
  Negative
One may also ignore the target and throw it somewhere else, inside or outside the strike zone.
  Negative
It will be a weaker pitch, but the hitting AI senses these weak pitches and will occasionally go after them.
  Negative
You can get a hitter particularly a poor one in a pressure situation to chase a bad pitch, where that happens entirely at random in something like MLB  The Show.
  Negative
Pitchers have two pitch types, one that's easier to control, but will never result in a high-rated pitch, and one that's harder to pinpoint, but if you do, it can be overwhelmingly effective.
  Negative
Against dangerous hitters whom I could afford to walk, I'd use the more accurate alternative to nibble around the edges of the strike zone.
  Negative
Power pitching is good fun when there's nobody on base, of course.
  Positive
It's also useful when you have to go after a hitter in a pressure situation.
  Neutral
The layered approach gave me a sense of pacing my starting pitcher in a way that other games don't.
  Negative
Hitters also have two swings, regular and for power, with a similar trade-off in accuracy and distance though it is possible to hit home runs with a regular swing.
  Positive
Where Super Mega Baseball's hitting shines is, again, with a very uncomplicated aiming system, letting you anticipate or wait on a pitch thrown to a certain part of the plate and then jump all over it if it goes there.
  Negative
Fielding and baserunning controls are rather standard for the genre, but hearty praise must be given to the game's physics.
  Negative
I saw ball trajectories of all types  home runs that bounced on the top of the fence, line drives that wrapped around the bag and kicked around in foul territory, and even bad hops off the lip of the grass bordering the infield dirt.
  Negative
The robust physics keep Super Mega Baseball from the bugaboo of repetitive gameplay that afflicts many arcade sports titles.
  Negative
Super Mega Baseball's secret sauce is in several variable influences that combine to make for some truly exciting and memorable at-bats.
  Positive
Each encounter is graded for pressure, with ones in late innings, runners on base and a narrow lead for either team being the most pressure-packed.
  Negative
Some pitchers are easily panicked; others will be confident.
  Positive
The best situation is when your player goes "in the zone."
  Positive
My catcher in the season-long mode goes in the zone whenever there's two strikes on her in an extreme pressure situation, and she has hit at least four game-winning home runs.
  Negative
Here's a fifth, in the bottom of the eighth inning, down two runs.
  Negative
Super Mega Baseball also tracks "Mojo," which rises or falls during a game according to a player's success or lack thereof.
  Negative
All players start out with different mojo.
  Neutral
It's important to get to a pitcher who has a lot of it early, so that they're not a problem in the later innings if they're still around.
  Positive
But a middle reliever with a big fastball doesn't look so tough when he has puny mojo and a bad accuracy rating.
  Negative
All of this conspires to give your players reputations and personalities as you take them through a season campaigns of ,  and  games, with playoffs, are offered.
  Positive
My second baseman has solid contact and power ratings, but his low mojo makes slumps a real problem.
  Neutral
I finally benched his ass, tired of watching him ground into double plays.
  Negative
The  fictitious teams all have comical mascots, ridiculous logos and players with double-entendre names.
  Negative
The rosters are fully customizable, meaning any gender, all ethnicities and body types, but their base ratings and attributes do not change.
  Negative
Even if you rename the whole lineup, you have to learn to live  and win  with the jokers you're dealt.
  Positive
I have.
  Neutral
I'm in the middle of my second season with the Wideloads, and I haven't cared about the characters in any video game this much since The Walking Dead: Season One.
  Negative
The game's brilliant upgrade system forces you to get to know your players' needs and strengths.
  Positive
Through the year, coaches, trainers, gear providers and stylists will become available for hire, each bringing three boosts that can be doled out to any player with an open slot.
  Negative
But it's a package deal: A boost you really want may be accompanied by two you already have or can't use.
  Negative
I found uses for boosts I otherwise wouldn't have considered, and felt that I was improving the club without driving it to super-team status.
  Negative
The boosts are comically named  for example, picking up the "legal representation" boost delivers a mojo buff.
  Positive
Players can be given "celebrity date" or "reality show appearance" boosts in addition to super carbon-fiber bats or the "greased uniform" that improves speed.
  Negative
It all builds up to performance-enhancing drugs at the highest level including a "horse hormones" buff with an outstanding icon.
  Positive
Super Mega Baseball's primary drawback is a lack of modes.
  Negative
There's no online multiplayer, for example, though there is local multiplayer.
  Negative
Although it has four richly illustrated stadiums, some might find the lack of variety repetitive in a longer campaign your venue is assigned at random, home or road, in season.
  Negative
None of that diminishes Super Mega Baseball as an arcade sports video game for the ages, worthy of the likes of Tecmo Super Bowl, NBA Jam, Mutant League Football and Backyard Baseball.
  Negative
No sports video game of  approached its subject with as much imagination as Super Mega Baseball.
  Negative
In such a rigid genre with high barriers to new ideas, this game is a legitimate breakthrough.
  Positive
here.
  Neutral
