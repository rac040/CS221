The Long Journey Home is a game of great ambition  an ambition that pulled me in before I realized the limited scope of its mechanics.
  Positive
The Long Journey Home or read the description on its Steam store page, youll get a sense for what this game wants to be: a procedurally generated science-fiction universe; a coherent, emergent sci-fi odyssey that players can shape through diplomacy, craft and skill.
  Negative
Its a tantalizing idea, and one that got me immediately excited to discover more.
  Positive
The reality is a lot less appealing than the pitch.
  Negative
The Long Journey Home contains some colorful ideas, but its dragged down by an overwhelming dependence on repetitive, discouraging tests of mechanical patience and skill.
  Negative
The Long Journey Home stylizes itself as a more scientific, literary roguelike.
  Negative
You play as the guiding hand behind an expedition to test humanity's first jump drive.
  Neutral
It malfunctions, of course, and deposits you on the other side of the galaxy, around a hundred jumps away from Earth.
  Negative
To get back, you'll have to meet alien races, conquer hostile terrain and upgrade your ship.
  Negative
At least, that's the framing idea.
  Neutral
The vast majority of my time with The Long Journey Home was spent controlling the velocity of a fragile spacecraft as I harvested resources from procedurally generated planets.
  Negative
On the primary star map, gravity is represented as a grid, folding and dipping as planets, moons and stars leave their gravitational indentations.
  Negative
And then there's the shuttle landing minigame, where you have to settle your lander down on a resource while managing approach vector, wind speed and escape velocity.
  Negative
These are the overwhelmingly primary mechanics of the game.
  Neutral
No matter what the page on the Steam store promises about diplomacy, trading and surprise encounters, eighty percent of the actual game is trying not to smash into the ground during these frustrating sequences.
  Negative
It's extraordinarily difficult to navigate around mountains, planets and meteorites in The Long Journey Home.
  Negative
A small miscalculation of velocity when you're trying to achieve stable orbit, and you bounce off the atmosphere, damaging your ship, injuring your crew and forcing you to try again.
  Negative
Even after over a dozen hours familiarizing myself with the game and its controls, I found myself approaching each new planet three or four times, swinging wide, coming up short, too fast, too shallow.
  Negative
The lander sequences are even more unforgiving and awkward.
  Negative
I routinely shaved off over half the lander's health just trying to perch it atop the meager resources the planet offers.
  Negative
Generally speaking, I did more damage to my lander trying to collect metal than I could ever repair with the metal harvested.
  Negative
Not to mention that bouncing your lander off the surface will seriously injure your pilot.
  Negative
A simple mistake can cause two or three semi-permanent damage conditions that you'll have to spend precious and rare items to repair.
  Negative
The Long Journey Home is a game dependent on extremely miserly resource management, and any kind of deep progress is only made possible by planning your expeditions with care.
  Negative
The game gives you an impression like you don't have to land on dangerous planets, that you can pick and choose to only make dangerous landings in emergencies, but the math just never added up that way.
  Neutral
It can take over five individual metal nodes to fix your ship, and a single mineral resource is almost never enough to allow a system-to-system jump.
  Negative
Being imprecise with velocity and skimming off a planet's atmosphere can give you a  percent penalty to filling up your jump drive, which can quickly leave you stranded.
  Negative
So you have to hoover up everything you see to survive.
  Positive
But there are so many serious, long-lasting, deeply impactful penalties for even the simplest of navigation errors in the simplest conditions that it's hard to come out ahead.
  Negative
I routinely quit back to the main menu and reloaded over and over to ensure that I would pull off successful resource runs with minimal damage to my lander.
  Negative
The most intriguing elements of The Long Journey Home are the ones teased as being in the late game: discovering ancient relics, resolving major interstellar conflicts, grand arcs of plot that are only suggested in the early game.
  Negative
But the whole thing is so mechanically punitive, so quick to mire you in the simplest, least engaging mechanics, that actually arriving at those most complex levels seems as distant as Earth itself.
  Very negative
Combat adds a whole new dimension of pain to the experience: Your ship, at least to start, is only capable of firing broadsides.
  Negative
These sequences play out like top-down naval engagements where your puny human vessel, firing and moving as agonizingly slowly as a Spanish galleon, must spar off against alien ships with homing missiles and defensive fighters.
  Negative
After dozens of fights, I still couldn't pin down proper aiming technique.
  Negative
My only workable tactic was to ram the enemy vessel, hook on the geometry of their ship, and fire point-blank.
  Negative
Combat can be expected about once per star system after the first star cluster, with some systems holding a half dozen enemy ships who all ask for Blood or Coin.
  Negative
The aggressive pace of the combat encounters further gates the narrative content behind a skill wall.
  Negative
There are complicated systems of allegiance with the aliens you meet, and they respond in complex ways to prompts and quests.
  Negative
For example, I accidently showed the leader of a pirate base the head of one of his lieutenants, whose ship I destroyed when they tried to rob me.
  Negative
At first, he screamed at the insult, then immediately offered me a job as a pirate for my bloodthirsty gall.
  Negative
Or consider an over-friendly race who offer helpful items, leaving you to realize too late that the items give your crew an infestation.
  Neutral
Narratively speaking, this is engaging.
  Positive
But mechanically, its infuriating: insult on top of injury.
  Negative
The excitement of being offered a piracy job is dulled when you consider that it means you have to spend more time with the combat minigame.
  Negative
I can tell that The Long Journey is a complicated game, but the narrative is the least complex thing about it.
  Neutral
That's the fundamental frustration of the game: It's marketed to people exactly like me, sci-fi fans who want a video game that's grounded in the optimism and curiosity of the science fiction novels of yesteryear.
  Negative
Artistically, thematically, the game follows in those footsteps.
  Negative
But don't get the impression that it's a casual game by any means.
  Negative
It's a cruel and finicky physics puzzler.
  Negative
It requires absolute attention be paid to each one of its many mechanical systems, even on the easiest difficulty.
  Negative
It supposes the power of your imagination is enough to make micromanaging the curve and flight velocity of a cursor on a screen exciting.
  Positive
