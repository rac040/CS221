Inside is a better game than Limbo.
  Positive
I don't make that claim lightly.
  Neutral
Limbo, the first and, before now, only game from Inside developer Playdead, stands as one of the first great triumphs of console indie games.
  Very positive
It was a gorgeous, clever, moody, polished platformer that gushed confidence, boasting a stark black-and-white art style and a haunting, unspoken narrative that left itself open to interpretation.
  Very positive
It was fantastic.
  Very positive
But Inside is better.
  Positive
If you're wondering why I'm comparing Inside so directly to its predecessor, that's because it's an extremely easy comparison to make.
  Negative
Like Limbo, Inside is a melancholy, sparsely colored D puzzle-platformer.
  Negative
LikeLimbo, Inside puts you in the shoes of a small boy cast into a mysterious, dangerous, often disturbing situation.
  Negative
It's also a staunchly linear game  you'll spend most of Inside running from left to right, navigating through occasional often lethal puzzles that bar your progression, before moving on to the next sequence.
  Negative
It's what Playdead does within the framework it established with Limbo that makes Inside so damn good.
  Positive
From the opening title card to the moment the credits roll, don't expect to see a single word of text or dialogue in Inside  there is none.
  Negative
While Limbo was ostensibly a story about a boy rescuing his sister, Inside is more concerned with pulling you into its world than telling the story of any one specific character.
  Positive
Thankfully, this shift in focus is earned, as the universe Inside depicts is one of the most eerie, most captivating settings I've ever encountered in a game.
  Positive
Where Limbo dealt primarily in silhouettes, Inside's world is a much more concrete setting, literally and figuratively, than anything you saw in Playdead's previous game.
  Negative
I hesitate to give specifics, because it's best discovered on your own, but broadly, Inside expertly depicts a run-down, dystopian universe think Half-Life 's City , but, uh, bleaker populated by individuals whose exact nature I had just barely started to understand by the end.
  Negative
Inside drips atmosphere and effortless world-building.
  Neutral
You'll find no audio logs or graffiti written on walls in blood here, as Inside trades in subtler, more ambiguous hints at its true nature.
  Negative
That nature bears more than a passing resemblance to Playdead's previous game.
  Neutral
For all the beautiful set dressing, Inside is, at its core, a puzzle game  and it's a very good one.
  Positive
You're free to experiment with each puzzle's elements  to prod at the machines, environments, people and other elements, to explore their exact properties, test things out  but each encounter is balanced in such a way that makes them all next to impossible to brute-force.
  Negative
It's unlikely that you'll pass any of Inside's puzzles without knowing exactly what you did to solve it, which made each one I conquered that much more satisfying.
  Neutral
There will probably be moments in Inside that stump you, with no hint system to speak of and puzzles that occasionally require some serious lateral thinking.
  Negative
When I got stuck, I stood up, walked away, came back and reconsidered every piece of the puzzle.
  Positive
The solution was always right in front of me  usually on the very screen I was staring at.
  Positive
In hindsight, every solution in Inside feels obvious, and I struggle to think of a single instance where I felt cheated or misled by its logic.
  Negative
Likewise, the game feels entirely free of those pesky puzzle solutions that should work but don't.
  Negative
Inside did a marvelous job of virtually never putting me in situations where I knew how to solve a puzzle, but couldn't quite execute on the solution.
  Negative
The game feels honed and heavily edited, with each mechanic used only as long as it's interesting to do so.
  Negative
It's a lean, efficient, almost entirely non-repetitive experience, and each of its puzzles has something new to teach.
  Negative
The game is full of moments that feel truly handcrafted  it's not the longest game in the world, but it's packed with countless memorable setpieces that I remembered with perfect clarity my second time through.
  Positive
The game is riddled with bespoke details, like knocking over a rusted refrigerator in a forest and watching leaves fly into the air, that have no gameplay relevance but exist just to add to a sense of place.
  Negative
For a game this beautiful and physics-driven, it's a startlingly responsive one, whose animations perfectly straddle the line between looking convincing and feeling great  a rare feat.
  Positive
But physics are where Inside's greatest innovations lie.
  Negative
There's a momentum and weight to every animation in Inside that feels good, reliable, consistent.
  Positive
Every stumble, every frantic, panicked run animation, every death, is bound to  and sold by  the game's robust procedural animation system.
  Neutral
It's also a technical masterpiece.
  Very positive
Inside has been six years in the making, and it shows: It's among the most refined video games I've ever played.
  Positive
For all the ambition of its physics, the game engine never flinches.
  Negative
Across four playthroughs, I somehow never saw the cracks.
  Negative
That seamlessness affords Inside an impact that other sidescrollers just never manage.
  Negative
Yes, it has things to say about class, free will, even games.
  Positive
It occasionally steps right up to the line of "edgy" ... but it never steps over it.
  Positive
It's a remarkable exercise in taste and restraint, with a tonal and emotional range I didn't know Playdead was capable of.
  Positive
Inside is also, by far, the scariest sidescroller I've ever played.
  Negative
The game is adept at putting you in terrifying situations, but it's truly at its best when it's forcing you, as the player, to put yourself in those situations to progress.
  Neutral
Some of Inside's best sequences are hand-tailored, perfectly timed close calls, tuned to minimize player frustration while maximizing player anxiety, that always leave you feeling like you barely escaped by the skin of your teeth.
  Positive
It's at once both horrifying and exhilarating in a way I didn't think a .
  Positive
D puzzle platformer could be, and its masterful use of tension is one of Inside's most impressive accomplishments.
  Very positive
More importantly, for all the things Inside has in common with Limbo, the ending isn't one of them: Inside actually sticks its landing and ends in an immensely satisfying way.
  Positive
The final act of Inside is legitimately one of the craziest things I've ever seen in a video game.
  Negative
I won't spoil it here.
  Negative
But it's beautiful, gruesome, one of the most hypnotic pieces of animation I've ever seen in any medium  and the whole thing is interactive.
  Positive
You might not walk away from Inside with every nagging question answered, but man, does it conclude.
  Negative
By every conceivable metric, Inside improves on the groundwork laid by Limbo.
  Negative
It deftly balances its elements.
  Positive
It could so easily have been too dark, too funny, too preachy  but it always stops just shy of going too far in any of those directions.
  Negative
At a glance, you could be forgiven for thinking that it hews a little too close to its predecessor.
  Negative
But Inside achieves something that Limbo didn't: It actually lives up to its opening moments, delivering astounding setpieces and an unforgettable final sequence.
  Positive
Those jaw-dropping last moments are a fitting endcap to this superbly crafted, beautiful game.
  Positive
here.
  Neutral
