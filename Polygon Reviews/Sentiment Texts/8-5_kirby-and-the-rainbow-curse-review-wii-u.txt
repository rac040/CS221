As a new game in the long-running Kirby franchise, Rainbow Curse brings little in the way of innovation.
  Negative
Its clay-themed world is killer cute, but the charm of its plucky pink hero is familiar to anyone who's ever played a Kirby game: Here's an adorable character saving his adorable friends, with gameplay mechanics that youll be able to grasp from the first level.
  Positive
Kirby and the Rainbow Curse has no desire to subvert that reputation, but instead embraces the straightforward.
  Negative
It's a game that asks you to repeat the same actions over and over, but with careful purpose each time.
  Negative
Kirby and the Rainbow Curse follows up on the early Nintendo DS game Kirby: Canvas Curse nearly a decade later.
  Negative
Dreamland has been sucked dry of its color and life by an evil force.
  Negative
Kirby is revived by a paintbrush fairy, but developer HAL Laboratorys pink puff of a hero is stripped of all his basic powers  eating enemies, copying abilities, even the freedom to move on his own.
  Negative
Where past games have placed emphasis on power-ups, Rainbow Curse reduces Kirby to a tiny ball of clay whose actions are molded by the player and their stylus.
  Negative
The swipes I made on the GamePad spat out a length of rainbow rope, which acted as Kirby's lifeline.
  Negative
These ropes serve a couple different purposes; on a basic level, Kirby will cling to them to achieve forward motion, or roll across them as a bridge.
  Positive
But theyre also a potential playground for Kirby to twirl and spin around.
  Negative
They can even provide clever protection against harsher elements.
  Negative
I traced out long, winding ropes to hurl Kirby into treasure, or deftly scratched protective lines around him to create a barrier.
  Negative
Acting as both guide and protector is as challenging as it is satisfying, and watching Kirby roll smoothly along a masterfully drawn line was gratifying every time.
  Positive
Rainbow Curse isn't as easy as drawing lines, however.
  Negative
Your rainbow thread will need to recharge, which can leave Kirby potentially defenseless for a short time.
  Negative
This adds smart limitations, especially when levels charged me with keeping Kirby buoyed by the rainbow in otherwise empty spaces.
  Positive
Rainbows will fade after a short amount of time, but the game allows you to undo a bad draw by simply slashing through it with another stroke.
  Negative
HAL Laboratory breaks Kirby and the Rainbow Curse into themed worlds that include a handful of levels culminating in a boss fight.
  Negative
Each world is short, but they all elaborate on Rainbow Curse's basic mechanics.
  Negative
The ocean-themed world, for example, sent my stylus scurrying after Kirby as he got swept up in fast currents.
  Positive
A volcano-themed world, meanwhile, forced me to think one step ahead as I kept Kirby away from lava pits or deflected fiery waterfalls.
  Negative
Every movement I made felt like it served a purpose, because as a helpless, doomed-to-roll-without-end ball, Kirby needed the constant attention of my stylus.
  Negative
Occasionally the game introduces vehicles to transform into: rocketships, tanks, submarines and so forth.
  Neutral
These experiences usually only last for a level or so in each world, but theyre a sweet way to add some variety to a game otherwise filled with rainbow spaghetti.
  Positive
I loved cruising around water levels that featured the submarine, for example, because it completely changed the way I played.
  Positive
Submarine Kirby can only move when you tap a specific location to relocate him to; when you fire, you have to use your rainbow ropes to direct his torpedoes.
  Negative
After spending most of my time thinking about how and where to move Kirby, it was refreshing to use the games mechanics in a new way.
  Positive
Playing Rainbow Curse with friends is the closest version of easy mode the game has.
  Negative
The game supports up to four players, with each character after Kirby defaulting to a Waddle Dee-like friend.
  Negative
Although adding friends is always more fun, it does make the experience feel easier in many ways.
  Positive
Waddle Dee or similar characters are free to roam about and attack like normal characters.
  Negative
They can use rainbow ropes as bridges, but they cant roll along them like Kirby does.
  Neutral
Its a give-and-take compromise that can be appealing to players who arent keen on skipping rope, but disappointing for anyone hoping to slide along with Kirbys grace.
  Negative
Multiplayer misses out on the real joy of Rainbow Curses movement mechanics, but it made my experience with bosses better  and gave me the chance to share my time with friends.
  Negative
Kirby games default on being ultra adorable, and Rainbow Curse is no exception with its slick claymation aesthetic.
  Negative
But its looks are exceptionally deceiving when it comes to the games difficulty; boss battles get noticeably tougher, and I progressed deeper into Kirbys world with a lot of swearing.
  Negative
But if a hard time isnt something youre seeking, the game is there for you, too; after dying several times on the same level, I was always offered the chance to move on.
  Negative
I never took this white flag, but it made beating those levels all the more satisfying.
  Positive
Its hard to find many things to complain about in Kirby and the Rainbow Curse, because its just such a sweet, straightforward game.
  Positive
There are diary entries, items and trophies to collect, and challenge modes to revisit, but ultimately its fun comes from the little moments  prodding Kirby along in a particularly satisfying stroke, or sending him on crazy loop-de-loops with your rainbow, just because you can.
  Negative
