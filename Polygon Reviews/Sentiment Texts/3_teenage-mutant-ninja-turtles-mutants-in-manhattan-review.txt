As Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants in Manhattan installed, I couldn't help wondering: Which Platinum am I about to get?
  Negative
Transformers: Devastation?
  Neutral
Maybe?
  Neutral
The Legend of Korra.
  Neutral
May God have mercy on us all.
  Neutral
I'm not going to recap a story for you.
  Negative
The Turtles hate Shredder, Shredder hates the Turtles, everybody fights forever.
  Negative
The rhino man and and warthog boy are there too.
  Neutral
They are always there.
  Neutral
Shredder has a space laser?
  Neutral
Maybe it belongs to Krang?
  Neutral
None of it matters enough to recount.
  Negative
The cutscenes are probably more interesting than the loading screens they obscure, which is the kindest thing I can say for them.
  Negative
Each turtle can equip up to four of the  or so ninjutsu, which offers a lot of flexibility at the cost of being an absolute chore to manage.
  Negative
Also, trying to remember to which buttons and which turtles have your  different ninja arts equipped in the heat of battle is an exercise in frustration.
  Negative
Transformers: Devastation, Platinum piles on several more fiddly systems.
  Negative
Each turtle can equip a stat-boosting charm, and charms can be upgraded and dismantled, and none of the boosts are very good so let's not waste more time with this sentence.
  Negative
Ninjutsu can also be upgraded, but it's done with the same currency as unlocking new skills.
  Negative
I saw precious few new abilities because I had to keep pumping points into existing powers to keep up.
  Positive
I could fill a review with all the odd, extraneous cruft that has been injected into Mutants in Manhattan to help hide the fact that the central game is utterly without merit.
  Negative
Sadly, I have to leave room to make fun of Michelangelo's misuse of the term "Fastball Special" later, so I'll keep it to a paragraph:
The Turtles can knock out unaware enemies in one hit, but as enemies are rarely ever unclear on the location of the four screaming, pizza-throwing man-turtles, there's not much point to stealth.
  Very negative
The Turtles can grind on wires and rails in a handful of stages, but this is never meaningful or fun.
  Positive
The Turtles can climb walls, which seems to serve no purpose other than to allow environments to be carelessly constructed.
  Negative
So what is all this mechanical window dressing trying to cover up?
  Neutral
Only the most insipid brawler I've played in recent memory.
  Negative
The enemies keep coming, and you have to keep hitting them.
  Negative
Sometimes there's a bomb to defuse hold a button when enemies are dead or a terminal to hack hold a button when the enemies are dead.
  Negative
It's never anything approximating fun.
  Negative
Oh, I take that back: Three times, you spend  seconds rolling a ball to a hole.
  Negative
That was OK.
  Neutral
If you were being forced to play Mutants in Manhattan and looking for any way to make it more palatable, suffering alongside friends or randomly matched strangers may be your best option.
  Negative
Each player takes on one of the turtles, which, satisfyingly, feels a bit more deliberate than trying to micromanage three horrid AI partners.
  Negative
It also makes it easier to use abilities in concert if your fellow players know what they're doing.
  Positive
It would be even easier with couch co-op; sadly, this option has been omitted.
  Negative
Regardless, playing with other people doesn't fix any of the game's underlying issues.
  Negative
A boring, antagonistically repetitive slog is still that, no matter how people are along for the ride.
  Very negative
In the tutorial I was meticulously taught how to counter and parry.
  Negative
This became instantly hilarious when the game's first stage transmogrified my TV into an indecipherable nightmare collage of ninjas and neon lights, and I began to worry I had somehow unwittingly mainlined a -year-old boy's hypothalamus.
  Negative
There would be no parrying.
  Negative
I was doing well if I could spot my turtle on the screen.
  Positive
This unintentional joke is, incidentally, the only functional one in the game.
  Negative
The vast majority of the turtles' dialogue is supposed to be funny, and not a word elicits so much as a smile.
  Negative
But there are more than enough cringes to go around.
  Negative
At one point Michelangelo says, "That's my Fastball Special, dude!"
  Negative
when he throws a shuriken.
  Neutral
Hey Mikey?
  Neutral
Unless that last shuriken was your deceptively diminutive partner Shuriken Man, I assure you that was not your "Fastball Special."
  Negative
Doofus.
  Neutral
Is there an "all your base are belong to us" reference?
  Neutral
Of course there is.
  Neutral
While the game's writing isn't doing the turtles any favors, it at least makes them look cool with some flashy animations and cool character designs for them and their foes.
  Positive
Much of their impact is blunted by ridiculously overcrowded fights in laughably flat environments.
  Negative
Also, every song sounds like a low-on-toner dot matrix printer tumbling down the stairs of a burned-down synthesizer factory while it tries to print a picture of a guitar.
  Negative
So no, presentation doesn't save the ninja turtles' latest outing, but I'm not sure any amount of polish could have hidden just how boring it is to play.
  Very negative
Here is the story of every level of Mutants in Manhattan: I found some bad guys, I kept activating my special powers until all the bad guys were gone, then I moved on to the next herd.
  Negative
Didn't dodge.
  Negative
Didn't parry.
  Neutral
Didn't have to.
  Neutral
Just kept wading through.
  Neutral
This was all the strategy I needed to carry me to the boss, at which point things, unfathomably, took a turn for the worse.
  Negative
In another lousy habit from Transformers: Devastation, bosses have been juiced with ludicrous amounts of health that must be whittled away, rather than given abilities that would make for an interesting combat encounter.
  Very negative
Every boss  and this is going to sound like a joke, but I swear it's not  has seven health bars that must be depleted.
  Negative
Seven.
  Neutral
In the last two bars, bosses get angrier and stronger; this is the point where they have their only real chance at wiping you out if you get sloppy.
  Very negative
Every boss is like this.
  Neutral
Every stage is like this.
  Neutral
In fact, the stages are just named after the bosses at the end, because who cares, right?
  Negative
I don't remember.
  Neutral
here.
  Neutral
