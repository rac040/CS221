As explained last week, Polygon chose to review Star Wars Battlefront based on time spent with the title via EA Access, which provided  full hours of the full game to subscribers starting last week.
  Negative
To get a broader range of input with a game aimed at a massive audience, we tapped Polygon editors Justin McElroy and Dave Tach, who exhausted their "Access" periods and then some.
  Negative
Star Wars Battlefront is a game of surprising variety and anachronistic constraints.
  Positive
For  hours, we fought Stormtroopers on the Tatooine hardpan.
  Negative
We've soared through its skies in X-wings and TIE fighters, too.
  Negative
We've role-played as Luke Skywalker and Boba Fett, captured Rebel bases, won riches for protecting drop pods.
  Negative
We've shepherded stubby, little GNK droids to safe harbor.
  Negative
We've toppled Imperial walkers with thermal detonators.
  Negative
And still, after all of the planet hopping, after all of the single-player, multiplayer and couch co-op, it's difficult to place in the shooter pantheon.
  Negative
It's not first-person or third-person.
  Negative
It's both.
  Neutral
It's not Battlefield, but it does feel like a distant cousin.
  Negative
Instead, Star Wars Battlefront walks a middle path between hardcore and casual, to varying degrees of success.
  Positive
Many of Star Wars Battlefront's multitude of modes are fun in ways that feel new and old simultaneously.
  Positive
A handful feel surprisingly dull.
  Negative
Star Wars Battlefront has two halves.
  Neutral
Depending on the mode, Multiplayer supports between eight- and -player online battles.
  Negative
A single-playerco-op hybrid called Missions contains wave-based incursions and large-scale battles against friends or AI.
  Negative
You can play Missions online with a friend or in a split-screen mode that, while playable, halves the normal  fps frame rate.
  Negative
Both halves include an abundance of maps in various sizes, and DICE repurposes them for multiple modes.
  Negative
No matter what corner of the galaxy you're fighting in, Imperials and the Rebel Alliance blast away at each other to rack up kill counts or complete objectives.
  Negative
Star Wars Battlefront's amount of variety is a real blessing for someone like myself who doesn't typically invest enough time in multiplayer shooters to reach the highest levels of expertise.
  Negative
When I would get frustrated by getting mutilated in the meat grinder of -vs.--player Supremacy, I really welcomed slower-paced modes like Drop Zone, which tasks players with capturing escape pods that crash-land on their planet's surface, or Droid Run, a sort of King of the Hill where the hills are mobile droids.
  Negative
I have the most mixed feelings about Heroes vs. Villains, in which Luke, Leia and Han are pitted against Darth Vader, Emperor Palpatine and Boba Fett.
  Negative
It's good practice for the rare occasions you'll take over a hero in the big multiplayer modes, and it's a good chance for someone without top-tier shooter skills to feel impactful in a game.
  Positive
But Battlefront just isn't balanced for hero-versus-hero combat, so battles that should be epic between Vader and Luke, for example, end up with two masters of the Force blindly swinging at each other, missing and then getting shot by a no-name trooper from behind.
  Negative
It just feels silly.
  Negative
The loadout system is another boon to the more casual shooter fans among us.
  Positive
The player has two item slots that include everything from single-shot sniper rifles to jetpacks, and being able to bring two grenades into battle was a good way for me to compensate for my aiming abilities.
  Negative
There's also a third blaster-centric slot that can improve the accuracy of guns briefly or let them fire longer without overheating.
  Negative
Curiously, this third slot runs on charges the number of which is persistent between games that you must replenish during play by finding glowing blue items on the battlefield or buying with accrued credits.
  Negative
I'm not sure of the logic behind the choice, but I became so wary of using the charges when I didn't desperately need them that I ended up largely ignoring the third slot.
  Negative
Speaking of not wanting to spend currency: It's baffling that aesthetic add-ons like costumes and hairstyles have to be purchased with the same credits used to buy weapons and items.
  Negative
Who would buy a beard before they have every jetpack, blaster and grenade available?
  Neutral
As a massive Star Wars fan, I'm predisposed to liking Battlefront.
  Negative
What surprised me, though, was how little I care about playing as almost anyone of note.
  Negative
Like Justin, I'm unmoved by the Heroes and Villains mode.
  Negative
With the notable exception of Boba Fett and even he has a bizarre and unwieldy control scheme, I have much more fun as an anonymous Rebel or Stormtrooper.
  Neutral
Their modes are much more interesting than the movie hero power trip.
  Positive
That wasn't the only surprise.
  Negative
I have fond memories of playing large-scale battles in the original Battlefront games.
  Neutral
But fights like those are now commonplace, and DICE's resurrection felt a lot like other contemporary multiplayer shooters.
  Negative
I despise the die, respawn, run for  seconds, die, respawn loop in other games, and I don't like it in Star Wars Battlefront.
  Very negative
It feels like business as usual, and no galaxy far, far away can make that fun.
  Negative
Instead, at least in these early stages, I'm much more interested in playing Star Wars Battlefront's Missions.
  Negative
These wave-based challenges work well alone and with friends, with the latter freeing me up to experiment and explore maps I'd fought on alone before.
  Positive
I even played split-screen co-op for the first time in years and enjoyed it.
  Very positive
EA DICE was smart to pepper the Missions'  rounds with objectives like capturing and securing drop pods, a structure that keeps the - to -minute battles from feeling stale.
  Negative
They're also full of collectibles yet another anachronism that gave me new things to do after multiple visits.
  Negative
And they let you play with weapons that you haven't unlocked in multiplayer.
  Negative
It's a nice dry run before spending actual credits on them, though it makes their absence in multiplayer more painful.
  Negative
Most importantly, though, these missions highlight my favorite part of Star Wars Battlefront: the level design.
  Positive
Star Wars Battlefront maps feel distinct, both within the game and the genre.
  Positive
Locations borrow heavily from the original trilogy and the upcoming The Force Awakens while notably skipping the prequels entirely.
  Neutral
There's fan service there, and the game does look beautiful, but they're more than a refreshing change of scenery.
  Very positive
The large redwood forests of Endor and the canyon-scarred wasteland of Tatooine upend a lot of modern level design sensibilities in favor of creative geography.
  Negative
In practical terms, there aren't many lines of sight in Star Wars Battlefront, which means that snipers are less of a problem.
  Negative
Canyons and sequoias also offer natural cover and a way to focus more on your immediate surroundings, and the game feels more welcoming because of it.
  Positive
DICE seemingly put a lot of energy into making Star Wars Battlefront as broadly appealing as possible.
  Positive
The compromises along the way could draw in some players like myself who normally wouldn't sink dozens of hours into a multiplayer-focused shooter, but I initially found myself worrying they may also limit the game's staying power.
  Negative
For example: New weapons and items unlock at what feels like a glacially slow pace, but that forced me to focus on becoming competent with the items I had on hand and genuinely improving.
  Negative
Compare that to Call of Duty, where I tend to flit between the shiny objects I seem to unlock after every round and never really live with one long enough to become deadly.
  Negative
For a casual fan like myself, that's a big plus.
  Positive
Admittedly, that slow pace along with the lack of weapon customization left me without the compulsive burning desire to play "just one more game" only to see what new trinket was right around the corner.
  Negative
It's an impulse that games like Call of Duty and Destiny have down to a science, but science isn't always a great substitute for fun.
  Negative
I want to play more Battlefront because it's just that: It's fun.
  Positive
In a sea of multiplayer-focused shooters, Star Wars Battlefront distinguishes itself as much by what it does as what it doesn't, and that comes at a price.
  Positive
Its old-school simplicity doesn't always mesh with its attempts to bring those ideas into , and it lacks some of those back-of-the-box bullet points that most modern AAA shooters wouldn't be caught dead without.
  Negative
here.
  Neutral
