And not just because its core interaction  a movement that could only be described as "rhythmic flailing"  is surprisingly exhausting, or because it possesses the most bizarre visual language ever seen in the genre.
  Negative
Those things are taxing, for sure, but they're also rewarding, because the core mechanics behind Fantasia are, when firing on all cylinders, a ton of fun.
  Positive
The problem with Fantasia is that it takes those cylinders  catchy songs, even catchier remixes and even entire game mechanics  and holds them hostage behind a frustrating, over-padded slog of a campaign.
  Negative
Harmonix actually managed to nail the hard part of making a modern rhythm game: The studio found a new, intuitive way to interact with music.
  Positive
The act of swiping, punching and tracing to the rhythm of different song components certainly takes some getting used to, as do the fast and furious command prompts for each gesture.
  Positive
With a little mastery, though, the game somewhat resembles its source material  the "Sorcerer's Apprentice" short from Fantasia the film.
  Negative
Where Fantasia succeeds is its various methods of letting players take control of and shape the songs they're playing.
  Negative
It's a fascinating design that touches every part of the game - instead of focusing on how many points you can get by keeping up with the music, Fantasia places an emphasis on building out the songs themselves.
  Positive
There are three versions of every track in the game  usually, the standard studio recording and two remixes.
  Negative
At set junctures in each level, you can pull different elements from each version.
  Positive
A couple times during the track, you'll also utilize "Composition Spells" to actually create a few measures of melody, rhythm, effects or other elements that will loop over the rest of the music.
  Negative
By the end of the song, the tune you've built will be unrecognizable and, almost invariably, pretty fresh.
  Negative
It's a different kind of reward than most rhythm games dole out.
  Positive
There's no semblance of musical simulation.
  Negative
There's no scaling difficulty options, meaning you're not really tracking development of expertise.
  Negative
Fantasia's rewards are the songs you create, from a folk-rockabilly hybrid remix of "In Your Eyes" or a ska-orchestral version of "Locked out of Heaven" which, believe me, is so much better than it sounds.
  Negative
You're offered the option of saving each mix you create after finishing a song, too, an option I exercised more than a few times.
  Negative
The Kinect does a fairly good job of keeping up with your rhythmic flailing, but runs into some slight consistency problems at the most inopportune times.
  Neutral
Most of the failed gestures I encountered happened at those aforementioned track-switching junctures, which occasionally refused to obey my swiping.
  Negative
A couple of the Composition Spells, which rely on various gestures, were a bit more finicky than the others, too.
  Negative
For the most part, though, the core mechanics work really well, delivering a sense of ownership over music that rhythm games don't typically deliver.
  Positive
In multiplayer, that sense is heightened even more  creating a melody with a friend while gesticulating dramatically like some sort of step-dancing crossing guard is an absolute blast, even if the two of you are doing a terrible job.
  Negative
But Fantasia needs every one of its components  the remixing, the composing, the musical ownership  to work.
  Negative
And its main campaign mode places every single one of them behind progression walls, forcing you to take your medicine before the real game can begin.
  Negative
Here is Fantasia's cardinal sin: The first time you play any song, only one of its three tracks is unlocked.
  Negative
To unlock the second, you have to play through the song and reach a certain score target.
  Negative
To unlock the third and final track, you have to play that song again, hitting a different score target.
  Negative
In addition, those Composition Spells also have to be unlocked, meaning they just don't appear in the songs that include them until you've completed the prescribed part of the campaign.
  Negative
Don't get it twisted: This is unadulterated and completely unnecessary padding.
  Very negative
Rhythm games typically don't require you to unlock songs anymore; Fantasia not only does that, it forces you to unlock mechanics  mechanics that it absolutely, desperately needs.
  Positive
It's not just that playing a song without all three tracks is markedly less enjoyable, the campaign itself is a chore from start to finish.
  Negative
To wit: It kicks off with a tutorial that breezily shows you the ropes, and then, inexplicably, it throws you into a lengthy series of standalone tutorials for each of the components you literally just learned.
  Negative
It's impenetrable, and  like the rest of the game  punctuated by beefy load times when starting or restarting a song, hopping into an overworld environment or viewing one of its completely banal cutscenes.
  Negative
The whole thing is just wildly out of step with Harmonix's patented enthusiasm for music  an enthusiasm that's still present, albeit muddled by the grind.
  Positive
You can see it in the game's environments, which spring to life as you play their requisite songs, giving you opportunities to, say, create ambient music in a sonic forest, or tune into dreamy radio broadcasts of "Rocket Man" from distant alien worlds.
  Neutral
The game's soundtrack is on the minimal side but it's pretty stellar, and its catalog of remixes are top-notch.
  Positive
But Fantasia: Music Evolved's campaign buries its wonder and experimentation behind a structure designed for an audience I cannot discern.
  Negative
A lot of the story seems geared to be kid friendly  but with no difficulty settings, it's going to be hard to guarantee that the game's actually friendly for kids.
  Positive
Following the game's commands is intense, especially in multiplayer, where the gesture indicators are color coded.
  Positive
Some of my friends  Dance Central and Rock Band veterans  had a really hard time scaling the difficulty curve.
  Negative
Fantasia: Music Evolved's saving grace comes in the form of a "Party Mode" toggle, which unlocks all of the game's songs, remixes and mechanics for you to play with outside of the campaign, but prevents you from unlocking achievements or completing challenges.
  Neutral
It's an accurately named setting: It instantly gives you every song in the way they're meant to be played, which makes for a pretty solid party game choice when combined with friends and drinks.
  Positive
Though, watch the flailing, please.
  Positive
here.
  Neutral
