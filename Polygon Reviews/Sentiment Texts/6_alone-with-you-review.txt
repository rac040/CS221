Developer Benjamin Rivers aims to tell an introspective story about human exploration  and human folly  in space.
  Negative
Classic sci-fi narratives have left their fingerprints all over it; The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury comes to mind.
  Negative
It even feels a little bit : A Space Odyssey, especially in the latter half of the game when the clock is running down and a creeping sense of dread sets in.
  Negative
Its the sort of dread that comes because youve read stories like this, and youll have suspicions about how it will end.
  Negative
Maybe youll be right.
  Neutral
Like many of the first settlers of Mars in Bradburys The Martian Chronicles, the human colonists in Alone With You are doomed by things they cant control, and can only try to understand.
  Negative
Alone With You strands you as the lone survivor of a space colonization attempt gone wrong.
  Neutral
Your only companion is the colonys AI.
  Negative
However, the AI still has data on four mission-critical colonists, which the AI uses to recreate them as holograms so that they can use their specialties and help you repair the colonys last escape ship.
  Neutral
You know that the people these holograms embody are dead  and the holograms know theyre dead too.
  Negative
But they take on lives of their own, and as you explore the planet, you have the opportunity to help each of them find closure.
  Positive
As I played, it struck me how much Alone With You feels grounded in a tradition of hard science fiction.
  Negative
Every facility that youll visit had a bearing on the colonys functionality.
  Negative
While the science may not be accurate and Im the last person to judge that, there are no details spared describing how the colonists terraformed and grew food, or how they harvested fuel.
  Negative
If you didnt know what a lenticular cloud is, or what a Bryophyte plant is, prepare to learn.
  Negative
But Alone With Yous mechanics cant meet the standard its narrative sets.
  Neutral
Gameplay quickly settles into a loop: find parts for the ship by day, and speak to the corresponding hologram by night.
  Negative
Scour the Agro-Dome for parts that day, for example, and youll be speaking to the hologram of Leslie Bharadwaj, who managed the colonys agricultural efforts, during your night in the Holo-Sim.
  Negative
As you explore, you need to find clues and codes to unlock doors and access more information.
  Negative
Little discoveries fit together one by one, painting a full picture of what happened at the colony.
  Positive
There are times in Alone With You when all the puzzle elements fall into place just right.
  Negative
One of the levels in long-suffering Colony B, for example, had me moving through the living spaces of the colonists and using what I knew about their lives to figure out the passcode to a door.
  Negative
It got me thinking about the contextual clues I was seeing in the environment, and it was an exciting puzzle to solve.
  Negative
Other times, I was left thinking that a solution was completely nonsensical.
  Negative
At one point, guessing the correct passcode to someones bedroom amounted to inputting the only numbers I found in the level  even though there was no logical reason for those particular numbers to be a passcode.
  Negative
Choice-driven conversations with the holograms account for the rest of Alone With You.
  Negative
In each facility, youll piece together the story of the colonists who worked there by reading their diaries and journals.
  Negative
Clues are revealed about their feelings for each other and their lives on the planet, complete with rivalries, secret romances and a lot of tragic endings.
  Negative
But once the conversations stop, everything else quickly feels stale.
  Negative
At the very beginning of the game, youre told that you have three in-game weeks to complete your objective of repairing the ship and escaping.
  Negative
After my first excursion to scavenge for parts, that seemed like an eternity.
  Negative
Daily tasks lacked variety, and the time limit felt more and more like a reminder of how much longer I would have to play the game.
  Negative
Almost every time the game announced a new day, I would sigh and count down the days until the ending.
  Negative
There is some payoff later in the game, when the daily routine finally breaks.
  Negative
This deviation successfully created an immediate sense of unease.
  Positive
On edge, I found Alone With You much more engaging than it had been in the beginning.
  Positive
Likewise, Alone With Yous storytelling was at its strongest when I was piecing together the lives of the other characters.
  Neutral
The opportunity to dig deeper into a relationship between two of the holograms, for example, kept me coming back to them over and over.
  Negative
But the holograms are ultimately more interested in you than in each other.
  Negative
Theyre always concerned about how stressed your character must be, and what a hard time you must be having.
  Negative
Through special visits, youre encouraged to choose one of the holograms with which to build a deeper relationship.
  Negative
The thing is, I never wanted to choose.
  Negative
And not because I was torn between liking all of them.
  Negative
Rather, none of the characters particularly stood out.
  Negative
They dont have discernibly unique speech patterns, and though they tell you stories that illustrate how different their personalities are, those personalities dont affect their conversations with you.
  Negative
Eventually it felt like I was speaking to the same gently concerned, introspective person every night.
  Negative
I never particularly wanted one of them to love me.
  Neutral
I think I broke a lot of hologram hearts.
  Neutral
It was only at the end that Alone With You stopped telling me how I should feel about the destruction of the colony, and instead made me feel it.
  Negative
Rather than being told by its characters what a hard time I must be having, I was put in a situation where my survival was in question.
  Negative
Alone With You is a game that understands that the inclusion of romance doesnt cheapen or detract from other themes, and it leans just as heavily on the science of science fiction as it does on its romance elements, if not moreso.
  Negative
And despite my initial apathy, the final moments of Alone With You were genuinely emotionally difficult.
  Negative
Its actually a miracle that it managed to affect me as deeply as it did, considering that minutes before I had been celebrating nearing the end of a game that I largely did not enjoy playing.
  Negative
If Alone With You had been as emotionally effective throughout, I would be singing its praises right now.
  Positive
Im usually more than willing to forgive boring, repetitive gameplay if a game leaves me a frenzied, sobbing mess on the floor.
  Negative
But in the case of Alone With You, I spent too much time bored with the gameplay, and annoyed that the characters were telling me how they assumed I felt.
  Negative
I'm curious about the other secrets I could discover, and other endings  but not curious enough to go back.
  Negative
here.
