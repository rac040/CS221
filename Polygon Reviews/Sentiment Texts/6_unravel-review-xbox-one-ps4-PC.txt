Unravel isn't knit together very well.
  Negative
In its debut at 's Electronic Entertainment Expo, Unravel seemed like a real sleeper hit in the making, with an instantly relatable, cute-as-hell mascot in the form of Yarny, a little red guy with big eyes and an adventure ahead of him.
  Negative
In a show full of violence and over-the-top presentation, an indie platformer from a handful of Swedish developers calling themselves Coldwood Interactive was the kind of story I wanted to believe in.
  Negative
Yarny is adorable in all the ways I'd want  he's vulnerable and resilient and genuine, and Coldwood's ability to capture all of this without a single line of spoken dialogue is impressive.
  Very positive
It's that characterization, through mannerism and animation, that does much of Unravel's heavy lifting.
  Negative
Without the occasional reminder of just how likable the little red yarn-man is, it would be difficult to recommend Unravel at all.
  Negative
Unravel tells a story, though it's hard to really get into without spilling the beans it very carefully doles out over the course of the game.
  Negative
You assume the role of Yarny, a little knit memento who sets out across a Swedish countryside that starts as a gorgeous bit of rural love letter and transitions to something more ominous.
  Negative
As Yarny explores, he comes across bits of memories and other knit objects representing the life of a family, and as he does, a faded, ruined photo album is restored, clarifying the story only hinted at over the course of Unravel's levels.
  Negative
Shy of those glanced bits of memory, there are no people in Yarny's adventure, though he visits a number of surreal representations of real places.
  Negative
You will meet other living things, though, from the harmless moose and I think reindeer of the countryside to more obnoxious and even dangerous animals like crabs and a real asshole of a gopher.
  Very negative
Unravel's presentation is beautiful, juxtaposing bits of fantasy  like a little man made of yarn running around  with mundane everyday objects and often playing with scale in a way that can be a little disorienting.
  Positive
Regardless, Yarny's position is always clear, always exposed, always vulnerable, and always just a little bit more heroic because of it.
  Positive
At first glance, Unravel looks like a dead-simple platformer whose narrative ambitions take precedence over any greater mechanical aspirations.
  Negative
For better and soon worse, this isn't the case.
  Negative
Yarny runs and jumps and clambers up ledges, sure.
  Positive
But the yarn that makes him up is another system layered into his basic traversal options.
  Positive
This starts simply, as you can swing from special points in the environment and make small rope bridges to walk across.
  Positive
It rapidly becomes more complicated as you're forced to create rudimentary pulleys and nets.
  Negative
This is the foundation of Unravel's puzzle design, and the bulk of its gameplay.
  Negative
It's also where Unravel starts to come undone.
  Negative
Yarny only has so much of himself to unspool, which means you can only tie off and backtrack your lines so often before he just can't move any farther.
  Negative
This is an intentional mechanic, as many puzzles include a pile of yarn to respool his capacity at some point, but others don't, leaving only so much room for error or experimentation.
  Negative
When it's just a pair of knots to tie or retie, this doesn't make much difference.
  Negative
Later, I didn't know I had it wrong until I'd tied three or four knots that then had to be untied before I had enough yarn to try something else.
  Negative
This doesn't sound like a big deal, I know.
  Negative
But it adds an enormous amount of busy work to a process that already feels pretty trial-and-error in a bad way.
  Negative
Unravel isn't great at suggesting solutions, as so many good puzzle platformers are, and the joy of experimentation fades after the th time retying a knot.
  Very negative
Each level tries to add a wrinkle to the formula, often via some new environmental cue, but the feeling of sameness nevertheless hangs over the game.
  Negative
Coldwood tries to break this up via a more difficult series of twitch-oriented platforming challenges.
  Negative
This could mean swinging from one point to another amid collapsing platforms or riding debris as it careens toward doom  the common factor here is an unpleasant wooly death.
  Negative
When Unravel wants you to solve a puzzle on your own time, it often struggles to explain what it wants.
  Negative
When it presents a sequence requiring reflexes as well, it speaks mainly via death.
  Negative
At these points Unravel transitions from monotonous and cute to frustrating.
  Negative
I found myself wanting to like the game whenever Yarny had a moment to express personality in even the smallest ways, but repeated deaths are the kind of distraction Unravel can ill afford.
  Neutral
This is exacerbated by checkpoints that feel miserly during demanding sequences but far too aggressive during more methodical knitting exercises.
  Negative
Even features in Unravel designed to help can seem ineffective.
  Negative
While you can reset to a checkpoint by holding down on the controller, the implementation here is basically useless.
  Negative
Not once in my five or six hours with the game did resetting a puzzle untie all the failed knots I had made, forcing me to crawl back in sequence, taking care not to wrap my yarn line around something and further hamstring myself.
  Negative
I would guess this kind of backtracking functionally doubled my playing time with the game.
  Negative
These consistent mechanical and level design stumbles undermine the story and narrative goals Unravel gestures toward.
  Negative
Underneath the ill-executed platforming and inconsistent signposting is a sort of exploration of life and death and family and the passage of time.
  Negative
Unravel is occasionally even successful here  I felt myself getting a little tight in my throat at points, even as the game practically beats you over the head with sentimental imagery.
  Positive
Yarny is charming enough as a character, and emotive enough to sell some of these moments; when he hugs something meant to represent a piece of someone's life, it's not just love but a fear of loss behind it.
  Positive
This is less successful when these moments are projected in the background behind a frustrating puzzle or homicidally demanding platforming sequence.
  Negative
Which is unfortunate  there's a real attempt at an examination of the course of a human life and the evolution of a family present in Unravel that goes beyond the tired rescue or redemption stories that pass for drama in the medium, much less game narratives that deal with growing old.
  Negative
I wanted to see it work more than it does.
  Neutral
There's an emotional core to Unravel that's difficult to overstate, and it's hard to ignore how strong a character the little red spool of textiles manages to become despite not speaking at all.
  Very negative
Unravel wants to say something, and I admire it for that.
  Positive
But it can be hard to shine a light on the bigger-picture things Unravel does well when it gets so many basic things fundamentally tangled up.
  Positive
here.
  Neutral
