For the past five years, weve witnessed a resurgence in punishingly difficult fantasy action games, led by Japanese developer From Software and its Souls series.
  Negative
Many titles have gravitated toward lessons learned from games like Demons Souls and Dark Souls, but no one has so brashly and blatantly copied Froms successful formula until now.
  Negative
That parts not so surprising, but Lords of the Fallen is a shocker in other ways.
  Negative
The balance between challenge and frustration in this type of game is delicate, as are the relationships between systems of loot, character growth and level design under the surface.
  Positive
It requires some real skill to not screw it up.
  Negative
I wouldnt have expected that level of mastery from Deck Interactive, a German developer thats never demonstrated a proficiency for creating complex role-playing games.
  Negative
Lords of the Fallen is far from perfect, but it is a worthy reproduction of everything that has brought hard games back into style.
  Positive
Unlike many other role-playing games, you dont create a unique character in Lords of the Fallen.
  Positive
Instead, you step into the heavy plate armor of Harkyn, a maligned criminal who has been released from his life sentence in prison by a mysterious mentor named Kaslo.
  Negative
With Kaslos guidance, Harkyn goes on a journey to rescue a kingdom thats being invaded by demonic forces from another dimension.
  Negative
The outline is a generic dark fantasy plot with a generic dark fantasy character, but Lords of the Fallen does a commendable job with the details.
  Positive
Harkyn, Kaslo and the few other friendly-ish characters you meet along the way are at least deeper than their paper-thin first impressions, if not fully fleshed out.
  Negative
I was genuinely surprised at a few points, as the plot occasionally contradicts genre expectations and shifts the final destination in unexpected directions.
  Positive
The story is also extremely easy to follow and isnt overbearing, an unlikely combination for the RPG genre.
  Negative
Cutscenes and short dialogue segments get across what you need to know briskly, and dont waste time showering you in nonsense fantasy terminology or interminable exposition.
  Very negative
You also gets some backstory via diary entries that the game kindly reads aloud,  la audio logs in action games.
  Negative
Even these extra bits of lore are mercifully kept short, pointed, easy to understand.
  Negative
Lords of the Fallens plot exists primarily to create justification for Harkyn to fight with a bunch of demons.
  Negative
Combat is the point of the game, and its absolutely where it shines the brightest.
  Positive
While you cant customize Harkyns look much, at the start of the game you choose between three classes that will help determine your combat proficiencies.
  Neutral
Choose the warrior, and youll begin with heavy armor and a shield that can stop most incoming damage.The rogue is better at dodging out of the way and performing swift counterattacks.
  Negative
Whether youre swinging a giant, two-handed axe or dual-wielding daggers, each weapon swing in Lords of the Fallen is a careful, measured thing.
  Negative
Many enemies have the ability to easily break you out of your combat animation while doing a huge amount of damage, so you need to be careful about when you choose to attack.
  Negative
Battles against even a single opponent can stretch out for a long time and require patience, but I felt rewarded for slow, smart play.
  Negative
If youd prefer to blow through battles a little faster, there are plenty of options to help you achieve that.
  Positive
Regardless of which class you choose, youre going to be a magic user.
  Negative
This might be the most brilliant thing about Lords of the Fallen.
  Positive
The cleric class is the closest thing it has to a default spell-slinger, but even heavy weapon-wielding warriors get a unique set of spells that weave together with their strengths.
  Neutral
Using these spells wisely greatly increased my survivability and the speed with which I could clear out enemies.
  Negative
As a warrior, for example, I often opened up battles with "Prayer," a spell that creates a clone of Harkyn to distract enemies and soak up some attacks.
  Negative
Then, as an enemy killed off my clone and turned to face me, Id have regenerated just enough magic power to use "Ram," an attack that creates another clone but this time sends it barreling toward the enemy, knocking them down and dealing damage.
  Negative
If I wasnt able to finish the enemy off with that opening, I could lead into "Rage," a simple attack buff that nearly doubled my damage output.
  Negative
If this huge variety of skills and choices at your disposal has any negative impact, its that sometimes it makes the game easier than it feels like its supposed to be.
  Negative
Near the end of the game, Lords of the Fallen allows you to look at your stats for each boss battle in the game  what weapon you used to defeat this boss, how many times you died, and the total amount of time you spent fighting this opponent.
  Negative
I beat almost every boss in the game on my first or second try, and almost every one in under  minutes.
  Neutral
On the one hand, it dodges the frustration that can come with repeated, trial-and-error boss encounters.
  Negative
But on the other I sometimes ended a major fight with a shrug of "huh, thats it?"
  Negative
rather than the sense of elation that games like Demons and Dark Souls provide at their best.
  Negative
Lords of the Fallen provides frustration elsewhere.
  Negative
While it has well-designed systems and a great if somewhat tiny world map that twists and folds in on itself with shortcuts and hidden passages, it also has a distinct lack of technical polish.
  Negative
On both console and PC versions of the game, I ran into numerous crashes  sometimes robbing -plus minutes of progress  and plenty of moments where the framerate became noticeably impaired.
  Negative
In one particularly aggravating instance, I was able to replicate a bug where the PC version of Lords of the Fallen crashed every time my character was set on fire by a specific attack in a specific boss battle.
  Negative
I ended up sticking to lower-damage ranged attacks for the whole battle just so the game wouldnt shut down on me.
  Negative
Im glad the option was there to allow me to sneak past this major bug, but it almost ruined my time with the game after over  hours spent on it.
  Very negative
I say almost because, even in the face of near-game-ending bugs, my time with Lords of the Fallen wasnt ruined.
  Negative
It largely succeeds in both imitation and with its strong variations on the formula.
  Positive
Lords of the Fallen is derivative; theres no doubt about that.
  Negative
But its also a surprising show of skill and hopefully a sign of much brighter things to come.
  Positive
here.
  Neutral
