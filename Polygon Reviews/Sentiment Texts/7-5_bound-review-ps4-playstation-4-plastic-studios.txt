Bound's ambition is nothing less than to unclutter the paths of our lives, the twisting corridors tangled with tentacular intrusions of personal and emotional barbs.
  Negative
Its stark message is that the sussurating ties that hold us  family, career, friends, our own worst impulses  ought not impede the liberation of self.
  Negative
That whole theme is presented through an iridescent world of dance.
  Positive
The player takes on the role of a vaguely humanoid woman, a dancer.
  Neutral
She is tasked with movement, exploration and survival.
  Positive
She follows a series of pathways toward mini-denouements involving fairytale archetypes such as Queen, Princess and Monster.
  Neutral
Chapter-by-chapter, these little stories conjoin to proclaim a highly satisfying narrative of love and life.
  Positive
It is both a parable and a metaphor.
  Positive
In this way, its structure is not unlike a grand ballet, in which story is suggested through movement.
  Negative
Bound's point is not to confound the player with a whorl of physical tests.
  Negative
It is to lead onward, toward a point of emotional revelation.
  Positive
Apart from the unfolding story, Bound's principal strength lies in braiding together the vivacity of its perplexingly gorgeous world with its central character's refined movement.
  Positive
She can walk and run and jump, like just about any other character from any other platformer game, but she is also capable of balletic dance moves.
  Positive
From the very start, intensely realized character animations transform her from a pile of polygons into a paragon of grace.
  Negative
Carefully choreographed interactions between limbs, muscles, arcs and twists provide one of the most lovely examples of human movement in gaming history.
  Positive
Unfortunately, it soon becomes clear that these dance moves are limited to no more than a handful in number, and that their relationships with one another lack creative utility.
  Very negative
The player can choose to pirouette, rond and sissone, but a shortage of variety leaves little room to amalgamate each into a complex piece.
  Negative
In gaming, the well-trod lane of character progression has been worn to dust, but Bound lacks even a fundamental sense of physical improvement, of latching on new skills and abilities.
  Negative
Bound could have offered a few more opportunities to trip the light fantastically.
  Negative
This omission seems a shame, given the sharp originality of the game's premise.
  Negative
This failure is reflected in some of the game's superb environmental storytelling moments.
  Neutral
There are magical occasions when the dancer comes across a physical space so ludicrously splendid that I was compelled to burst into a series of shimmers, just for the sheer joy of dance.
  Positive
For brief, intoxicating moments, I felt like it was impossible to resist the wonderful feeling that life is really a Broadway dance-musical and that the only sensible course of action is to spring and caper  a game that made me feel like Fred Astaire or Ginger Rogers deserves a tip of the top hat and a ritzy swing of the cane.
  Negative
But these moments are all too brief.
  Negative
Bound lacks the necessary palette to sustain anything that might feel like a dance creativity box.
  Negative
Strangely, dancing is mostly a matter of choice, rather than progressive necessity.
  Neutral
There are a few obstacles that require specific leaps and struts, but these are rare.
  Neutral
Much of Bound can be played by walking and jumping, though this course takes away some of its charm.
  Positive
When the player comes across menacing but non-fatal enemies  swishing reeds and buzzing insectoids  dance moves create a ribbon-like protective field.
  Negative
This somewhat lackluster attempt to marry mechanics with mission soon starts to feel mundane, like unfurling an umbrella.
  Very negative
So for Bound, dance is really an aesthetic complement to the wider world, rather than an essential act of mastery.
  Positive
The world and the dancer do homage to one another's beauty, especially in moments when the game succeeds in presenting itself as a highly original ballet stage rather than a so-so platform-puzzler.
  Positive
And, oh boy, the stage is really something: a shimmering riot of shape and color, transforming itself over and over again into Escher-esque contortions.
  Positive
This is a playful world that gestures toward the conventions of platform games, without entirely making a full commitment.
  Positive
It is a world to be experienced and enjoyed, rather than conquered.
  Positive
In fact, there are entire sections in which the player travels across whole levels, with little more to do than move the camera to better gaze at Pink Floydian vistas.
  Negative
Bound's landscapes fizz so brightly that they demand to be be explored more than once.
  Positive
They sit atop a bubbling chaos that suggests the infinity of hopelessness.
  Negative
Savage monochrome lines crisscross brutal shadows that vie for attention alongside meandering ribbons, fantabulous balloons and manic ziggurats.
  Negative
It takes a while to appreciate that this polygonal concoction is more than a mixed bag of surrealist fancies.
  Negative
The environment offers real meaning, to be found in a subplot that draws us into the personal memories of a woman who has daydreamed this world in an attempt to understand her own life, her memories and her future direction.
  Positive
The parallels between these two stories reveal themselves gradually and subtly, drawing the player onward.
  Positive
Bound's power rests in how its story and graceful mechanics entwine, showing us that art-forms like dance and video games are essential aids in understanding ourselves and the world around us.
  Positive
The game's cleverness rests in its ability to make the mechanic the message, and vice versa.
  Positive
Abzu  which spend their energy on creating a sense of wonder and meaning, rather than of challenge and victory.
  Negative
Each of our lives bind us to the lives of others, to our own desires and inadequacies, and to theirs.
  Positive
Bound is a reminder that through diversions like art, sport, dance and literature, there are ways to escape, at least for a while, and perhaps to re-emerge as someone slightly different.
  Negative
Bound is about finding that escape, and finding a way back.
  Positive
It presents us with a thought-provoking canvas of color, movement, narrative and grace that, while imperfect in execution, is nonetheless beguiling and beautiful.
  Very positive
here.
  Neutral
