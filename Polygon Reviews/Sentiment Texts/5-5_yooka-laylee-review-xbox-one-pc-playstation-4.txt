Yooka-Laylee is proof that sometimes our fondest memories should stay in the past.
  Neutral
The Kickstarter success story promised a new version of classic Rare-developed titles from the Nintendo  era, recapturing our fuzzy memories of games like the Banjo-Kazooie franchise, with a bit of Donkey Kong  thrown in there for good measure.
  Positive
The games Kickstarter exploded, setting records for the crowdfunding platform.
  Neutral
Developer Playtonic has been carefully faithful to what made those first games memorable, from the charming main characters to the focus on platforming, puzzle solving and secrets.
  Positive
But well-regarded as those games were,  years have passed since the first Banjo-Kazooie, and Yooka-Laylee remains too true to that original formula  even when it means not ditching game design ideas that feel stuck on those old cartridges.
  Negative
The premise of Yooka-Laylee is exploration and collecting.
  Neutral
The game begins as the titular duo, Yooka the iguana and Laylee the bat, realize the book they were using as furniture is an artifact that can rewrite the fabric of the universe  right around the time a comically evil heel, a corporate overlord bumblebee named Capital B, snatches it away.
  Very negative
The books pages  called Pagies, for an extra level of twee  escape Capital B by scattering themselves across Yooka-Laylees five worlds, and Yooka and Laylee will need to gather them all back up again.
  Negative
These five worlds, each with a unique, vibrant theme, are crammed full of activities and diversions.
  Positive
Every single activity is in service of collecting pages.
  Negative
And those activities get more plentiful after the world has been "expanded" by using some of your Pagies.
  Negative
Those expanded activities are, in turn, devoted to collecting even more pages.
  Negative
Those include lots of platforming challenges, puzzles, secrets and, you guessed it, other collectibles.
  Neutral
Youll have to dig through each world to find a Mollycool, which can transform Yooka and Laylee into some monstrous hybrid animal or machine; a play token that unlocks a classic game remake; five hidden ghosts that spit out one Pagie when all located; and lots of quills, which can be used to buy new moves.
  Negative
You can explore these worlds in any way youd like, which is a huge improvement to this genres structure.
  Positive
In older platformers, youd often be forced to fight a world boss before being able to unlock more areas  in Yooka-Laylee, youre only limited by the moves that Yooka and Laylee know.
  Negative
That openness is a welcome change, but I felt like every world badly needed a minimap I could refer to, especially when I found myself in random side passages or on top of some precarious platforming structure, trying to remember where something I saw on the last run through was hiding.
  Negative
The absence of mandatory world bosses is fortunate, because Yooka-Laylees combat is a chore.
  Negative
The worst of it is found in the games shooting.
  Negative
To get an accurate shot, you need to enter first-person mode by clicking in the left stick.
  Negative
While locked in this mode, you cant strafe or move at all, leaving you vulnerable in an actual combat situation.
  Negative
Another wrinkle: Your projectile weapons are only active for a short period after youve grabbed "ammo" from berry bushes.
  Negative
Yooka-Laylee often stakes some of its challenge on sometimes making you get to a far-off target before your powers vanish.
  Neutral
Its a common trap that Yooka-Laylee falls into  laborious gameplay alone didnt make for a sense of reward, or even a satisfying challenge.
  Neutral
For a while, I appreciated the games openness.
  Positive
I didnt have to keep beating my head against things that felt like chores  like having to ferry pigs dressed as knights across the map after Yooka and Laylee had been transformed into a helicopter  because there were plenty of choices.
  Negative
New worlds, which also contain new abilities, dont take many pages to unlock either, so there was a lot of incentive to do the bare minimum in each so I could get new skills, then return to previous areas once I had a fleet of techniques available to me.
  Negative
There are many things in earlier levels locked behind specific skills, and Yooka-Laylees most satisfying moments came from using my new tricks in concert to solve sequences of puzzles.
  Positive
All to get that get that Pagie, trapped in a Cagie.
  Negative
Yes, thats real.
  Positive
But other tasks were so frustrating I wanted to scream   like a gigantic golf game where you have three minutes to push a boulder-sized ball past enemies, over ramps, and through a freaking windmill without it plummeting into actual space.
  Negative
Thats when I realized I didnt have as much freedom as I thought.
  Positive
To unlock the games final boss, and finish my journey, I needed  book pages out of a possible .
  Negative
Its far more than the number you need to unlock and expand all the levels.
  Negative
With  book pages on each world, and  tucked among the rambling hub, I ended up doing tasks that felt like busy work after Id cleared all the enjoyable ones.
  Negative
Yooka-Laylee looks the part of an updated platformer, but some of its mechanics should have stayed back in the era it came from.
  Negative
There was a reason we havent seen more games like Banjo-Kazooie on modern platforms, and it wasnt just because Rare as we knew it was gone; its ideas were very specific to a gameplay era that weve evolved past.
  Negative
Fourth-wall-breaking dialogue, shiny characters and lush graphics cant save Yooka-Laylee from the dated framework that its built on.
  Negative
