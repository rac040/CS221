Capcoms Ultra Street Fighter  for Nintendo Switch isnt exactly a new game, instead bringing together elements of previous updates to one of the most iconic and beloved fighting games of all time to the new hybrid console.
  Positive
As a  year old game, theres not a lot new to analyze or say about Super Street Fighter  Turbo, but the question is whether its a reasonable option, and how well it works as a Street Fighter game.
  Positive
To talk about that, this review will take a conversational format between two of the longest-term Street Fighter fans at Polygon, Managing Editor Mike McWhertor and Reviews Editor Arthur Gies, each of whom has been playing Street Fighter  in arcades, laundromats and video game consoles since it originally released in .
  Negative
: I dont want to beat around the bush here so Ill just get to the point, or at least my point  Ultra Street Fighter  is a pretty weak version of the game in a lot of ways, and its hard not to look at it as a deeply cynical release.
  Negative
:  It's also hard not to bring up the price of Ultra Street Fighter   from the get-go.
  Negative
The game costs a staggering .
  Neutral
, making it feel like a bold-faced attempt to squeeze a few more dollars out of excitable Nintendo Switch owners looking for a proper fighting game and something new to play on the system.
  Negative
But value, of course, is subjective.
  Positive
And there are plenty of things Ultra Street Fighter  does right.
  Negative
Namely, it presents an arcade perfect  arguably improved upon  version of a beloved fighting game and tosses in two semi-new characters: Evil Ryu and Violent Ken.
  Positive
I enjoyed toying with those two character variants and revisiting a game I fondly remembered.
  Very positive
Of course, I spent all of my time playing Ultra with the classic graphics and sounds: I absolutely cannot stand the new graphics that Udon drew for the HD Remix release nearly !
  Negative
years ago.
  Neutral
This review is making me feel older and older by the minute.
  Negative
: Yeah, I was struck by how poorly the remastered graphics held up, as someone who somewhat remembers liking them back in .
  Negative
The original world warriors and even the Championship Edition fighters look ... fine, though maybe a little overstylized, but holy crap, the new challengers look terrible.
  Negative
Fei Long is kind of a disaster.
  Negative
I wont hold this against Capcom too much here, because a lot of work was put into making sure the frame data and hitboxes for HD Remixs sprites and those found in the original game are identical, which is critical to the games feel and balance.
  Negative
But in a way that feels indicative of the total package and how slipshod Ultra Street Fighter  feels, once I realized how much I disliked the updated graphics, I was stuck with them until I quit out of my Arcade Mode playthrough.
  Very negative
Its , and the idea of a visual overhaul that preserves original mechanics isnt new.
  Negative
And since HD Remix came out, there have been big quality of life additions to this kind of release  like real-time graphics switching.
  Negative
Maybe there arent enough buttons on the Switch to allow for instant swaps, but theres not even the option in the games pause menu to switch.
  Negative
You have to go all the way out of a game, back to the main options menu, which is both poorly organized and a complete eyesore.
  Negative
Theres no real sense of foresight apparent with this stuff.
  Negative
I know you werent a big fan of the cursory addition of a color mixer for fighters.
  Positive
: I was admittedly pretty excited about the color editor tool, something I'm a little embarrassed about; I just have a soft spot for character customization in fighting games.
  Negative
But the final result is far less interesting and less useful than I expected it to be.
  Negative
After making a Martian Chun-Li by mistake and some further bumbling through its confusing interface, I gave up.
  Negative
But we really need to talk about Ultra's other noteworthy addition: Way of the Hado, the brand new first-person mode in which you throw fireballs, dragon punch and tatsumaki senpukyaku as Ryu.
  Negative
It's a strange diversion at best and not an enjoyable one.
  Positive
I'll give Capcom a little credit for experimenting with the Switch's Joy-Con controllers.
  Negative
Holding one Joy-Con in each hand and mimicking Ryu's special moves is a good idea for the hardware, and Capcom's not exactly billing this as Ultra's biggest feature.
  Positive
This is a game that's fueled by nostalgia  the Street Fighter th anniversary logo that pops up every time you fire up the game reminds you of that  but Ive managed to develop zero nostalgia for finicky, clumsy motion controls.
  Negative
Furthermore, I can't say I'm a huge fan of using the diminutive Switch Joy-Cons to play a fighting game.
  Negative
: The Switch doesnt have a conventional D-pad on either Joy-Con, and when playing solo on the handheld or the Grip, trying to use the left face buttons for directional input is a nightmare.
  Negative
I think this is maybe the worst default control scheme a Street Fighter game has seen since it tried to squeeze on the Genesis unless you really want to beat up Capcom with the Gameboy version of Street Fighter .
  Negative
The analog sticks arent terrible, and I was able to pull of hadoukens and shoryukens with about - percent reliability, but its still not good.
  Negative
Nintendo and Capcom seem to be leaning into the Switch party trick of using the left and right Joy-Cons as separate pads for local -on- play, and technically, it does function  there are six buttons on each Joy-Con, after all.
  Negative
But again, they use the analog sticks for directional input, the "shoulder" buttons arent what Id call comfortable, and the right Joy-Cons stick is in the middle of the damn controller.
  Negative
If you thought arguments over who has to play on the right were bad, I cant imagine how ugly rock-paper-scissors matches over who gets stuck with the blue Joy-Con will get.
  Negative
Right now the best control option for Ultra Street Fighter  is the  Pro Controller, which has a perfectly serviceable D-pad, but its still a modern, conventional game controller in a fighting game.
  Positive
A fightstick is coming at some point, apparently.
  Negative
But right now, for more than double the price of the Xbox  and PS release of Super Street Fighter  HD Remix, its hard not to be frustrated and like you were saying Mike, Way of the Hado is, and I cant think of a better word for it, trash.
  Negative
: You mentioning the "Switch party trick" strikes me as potentially the right way to think of Ultra Street Fighter : not as a deadly serious fighting game, but as a party game, a piece of nostalgia  with the price to match  to trot out for old folk like us.
  Negative
It'll never compete with the likes of Capcom's current fighting games in terms of lasting value or, more importantly, precision, but it's been a pleasant enough trifle.
  Positive
If you'd told me  or even  years ago that we'd get a better-than-arcade port of one of Street Fighter's best entries that's playable on a portable, I'd have been thrilled.
  Negative
But we've come to expect a lot more from fighting games these days, ironically by Capcom itself, and Ultra Street Fighter  just doesn't do enough to justify its price tag or overshadow its shortcomings.
  Negative
