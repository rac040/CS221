A developer, Ready At Dawn, with a solid track record.
  Positive
A setting, Ripper-era London, that I love.
  Positive
A premise, a new generation of Arthurian knights battling the supernatural, which seems just chock-full of promise.
  Negative
Also, it's an absolute jaw-dropper graphically.
  Negative
This is the sort of game I would have paid for in full months in advance.
  Neutral
That exuberance would have saddled me with a dull, disjointed game that never quite lives up to its promise, despite often delivering on the technical front.
  Negative
The knights of The Order aren't the same that once sat around Arthur's Round Table, of course, but they're not quite as far removed as you might think.
  Negative
Thanks to the discovery of a substance called "Black Water," Order members have greatly extended their life span, passing down their names once their service is done.
  Positive
The Order: 's star is the current Sir Galahad, though friends still refer to him by his given name of Grayson.
  Negative
In addition to the ever-present threat of werewolves  sorry, LycansGrayson's brethren are also pitted against a new rebellion causing problems for the British crown and the United India Company, an economic powerhouse that employs its own private army to protect its interests.
  Negative
The plot unfurls from that potentially dynamite setup, but rarely follows any one thread long enough or well enough to carry any emotional weight.
  Negative
For a group of people literally defined by honor, knights of The Order seem to change their affiliations and moral code with the shifting of the winds.At one point, Galahad pursues the rebels to an airship with his protege Lafayette, partnerlove interest Isabeau and his commanding officer Sir Percival.
  Negative
When asked about the rules of engagement, Percival insists there won't be time to distinguish between United India Company guards on board and rebels who may have infiltrated their ranks.
  Negative
That's right: Knights of The Order, when busy enough, will just start killing innocents.
  Negative
Not to belabor this point, but the fake guards don't have UIC insignias on their arms, a fact that probably would have sped up sorting out the frauds considerably.
  Negative
Grayson is well aware of this fact he's the one that mentions it later in the level, in fact  but inexplicably decides not to mention when trigger-happy Percy rolls out his "Kill 'Em All" plan.
  Positive
I know "poor justification for murder" sums up plenty of video game plots, but if you're going to crib from Arthurian legend, it might be wise to at least in some way nod to the ideals and themes that are central to that mythology.
  Negative
The story, which gets progressively more disjointed as the game continues, is also poorly told, with conversations fluidly swinging from cliche to cliche, like a sort of hackneyed Tarzan.
  Very negative
But the real sin of The Order:  isn't its shoddy storytelling or regrettable dialogue.
  Negative
No, the real problem is that it's all so incredibly boring.
  Neutral
Every moment of The Order: , from the in medias res opening to the abrupt final battle, feels entirely predetermined.
  Negative
With the exception of a handful of gun battles, in which the player is free to decide in which order they will kill all the bad guys, Ready At Dawn is entirely unwilling to let go of the player's hand.
  Negative
This is the sort of game that prompts you to hammer on the X button to break a thug's arm, but should you decide not to, Galahad will simply continue to hold the rogue's wrist and keep smooshing his face into a wall for all of eternity.
  Positive
It simply has no vocabulary to speak to the player who doesn't instantly comply  percent of the time.
  Negative
Complying in The Order:  typically takes the form of a third-person cover-based shootout that borrows liberally from Gears of War, moving the bulky Galahad to a cover point, popping off a few shots and repeating.
  Negative
Though knights of the Order have a few cool toys namely a gun that shoots ignitable thermite clouds and a rifle that hurls bursts of electricity, you'll run into them just a couple of times.
  Negative
Instead, I relied on an uninspiring assortment of pistols, shotguns and rifles.
  Negative
For what it's worth, enemies do react to gunshots in specific limbs, so if that's the level of grisly fidelity you demand, you'll be happy to hear it's available here.
  Positive
The other gameplay tools at The Order: 's disposal include some admittedly pretty cool contextual melee kills, a "Blacksight" mode which slows time momentarily while auto-targeting enemies for batch execution, and a handful of rough stealth bits in which getting spotted means instant death.
  Negative
Oh, and quick-time events, there are a lot of those too.
  Negative
The components are all passable and employed with enough variety, but you've seen every single one of The Order: 's tricks performed better elsewhere.
  Negative
And you're given such little agency in how you employ those tricks that you're left with the overwhelming feeling that the game is holding you at arm's length.
  Negative
The one area where The Order surpasses the "been there, shot that" vibe is in its presentation.
  Negative
There is, in my estimation, no better looking game on consoles.
  Positive
Victorian London is rendered in beautiful, exacting, sooty detail with just enough steampunk flourishes to make it seem otherworldly.
  Positive
The shift in fidelity between cutscene and gameplay is so imperceptible that it's hardly worth discerning between the two.
  Negative
Though hopelessly outdated from a mechanical perspective, The Order:  is at least decked out in its next-generation finest.
  Negative
here.
  Neutral
