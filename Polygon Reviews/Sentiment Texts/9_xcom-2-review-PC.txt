Where previous sequels to XCOM games have failed, XCOM   the sequel to 's reboot, XCOM: Enemy Unknown  succeeds.
  Negative
Stand down, Terror from the Deep.
  Negative
Sleep softly, Apocalypse.
  Negative
Requiescat in pace, Freedom Ridge.
  Neutral
Your watch has ended.
  Neutral
Firaxis, XCOM's newest steward, is here to relieve you.
  Negative
XCOM  is bigger, stronger and more capable than XCOM: Enemy Unknown in every way.
  Positive
And in spite of a few lingering technical issues, it may be the best XCOM game ever made  and a fitting tribute to those that came before.
  Positive
XCOM  takes place after the first game's alien invasion and the governments of the world's attempts to stop it.
  Negative
years later, humanity has fallen to the alien invasion, Earth's militaries are routed and the original XCOM project overrun.
  Negative
The aliens, who now call themselves Advent, have taken control of the planet's last remaining urban centers and remodeled them in their image.
  Negative
It is a police state, where order is ruthlessly maintained by heavily armed hybrid soldiers.
  Negative
Outside these futuristic urban centers mankind ekes by without running water, power or security of any kind.
  Negative
What remains of the XCOM project has retreated inside of the hulk of an advanced alien UFO, constantly moving around the world to avoid detection.
  Negative
From this mobile base XCOM's last remaining soldiers, scientists and engineers wage a guerrilla-style war without an end in sight.
  Negative
What XCOM 's premise provides are opportunities to build characters, not the least of which is you  the Commander  who are dramatically welcomed into the narrative during the game's tutorial mission.
  Positive
There's Central Officer Bradford, your Jiminy Cricket from the original Firaxis game now hardened by  years of struggle.
  Negative
There's An-Yi Shen, the daughter of your head of engineering in the  game as well as Dr. Richard Tygan, who spent years as a slave before escaping the aliens and joining XCOM.
  Negative
They all give evocative digital performances and provide the game with its heart.
  Positive
Traditionally the meat of any XCOM title are the turn-based, isometric battles.
  Negative
As in Firaxis' first outing, in XCOM  they are fantasies about the kind of perfect, real-time information that allows remote commanders to order individual troops to pull their triggers from a comfortable distance.
  Positive
In practice players watch over their soldiers' shoulders, march them into the dark parts of the map, push back the fog of war to activate hidden aliens and put a bullet in their brains.
  Negative
XCOM  features a peer-to-peer multiplayer mode, allowing for head-to-head battles between squads composed of mixed Advent and XCOM forces.
  Negative
Using a points-based system, players purchase units and then select the game type and the kind of terrain they'll fight on.
  Negative
It features public and private games, ranked matches and options for playing over a local area network.
  Positive
Unfortunately, we weren't able to get enough experience with the mode before K's embargo lifted.
  Negative
We'll update this review with impressions of XCOM 's multiplayer mode in the next few days.
  Negative
In that way, XCOM  plays like every other game in the franchise that's come before.
  Negative
Except for the times when it doesn't.
  Neutral
Much of the time it's your troops that are hidden and lurking in the shadows, and it's the aliens who are drawing aggro from you.
  Positive
XCOM  is about the art of the ambush.
  Neutral
A clever concealment mechanic means that during many missions your soldiers will be able to sneak up on the enemy without alerting them.
  Positive
This one change breathes new life into the formula.
  Positive
Suddenly there were twice as many tactical options, and twice as many different kinds of missions as there were before.
  Negative
Firaxis has also added mission objectives to the mix.
  Positive
In addition to simple extermination, most have a thematic timer counting down.
  Negative
Not a can of "meld" sitting in plain sight but a piece of intel rigged to explode, or an off-map assault craft closing in to shoot down your ride home.
  Negative
XCOM  has search and destroy missions, rescue missions, covert sabotage missions, asset retrieval missions and good old-fashioned heavily armed assaults.
  Negative
The incredible scenario variety, and the procedurally generated maps themselves, gives the gameplay an organic, deliberate kind of pacing.
  Positive
The progression from offense to defense, from reconnaissance to assault kept my attention.
  Negative
As importantly, where other XCOM games were a slog from start to finish  lengthy bug hunts bracketed by total party kills  XCOM  uses its different mission types to create a narrative arc that simply hasn't existed in the series before.
  Negative
The strategic layer of the game has also been completely overhauled.
  Negative
What was essentially a resource-optimization game, a race to unlock the next scientific advance, is now something on par with a finely tuned worker placement board game.
  Positive
You'll assign engineers to specific tasks by hand, carefully pushing your mobile base to its limits.
  Positive
The Avenger itself will need to go on errands here and there, all while avoiding detection.
  Negative
You'll travel to one corner of the world to launch a daring raid behind enemy lines, and the next moment you'll swoop in to defend a resistance cell at their hidden base.
  Positive
It's as if the same kind of tension found in XCOM's tactical layer has finally trickled up to the strategic layer, and XCOM  is all the better for it.
  Negative
When the administrative work is done and missions are unveiled, they're not rushing you from location to location to put out random fires.
  Negative
Instead, the game regularly feeds you goals and objectives that focus on supporting your civilian allies in the resistance and striking strategic blows against Advent military installations.
  Positive
It teases at plot points, it foreshadows climactic battles and provides solid feedback  in the form of in-game currency and loot, but also cinematic cutscenes  that make the effort worthwhile.
  Positive
In motion, XCOM  makes the original reboot from  and its DLC expansion look amateurish by comparison.
  Negative
Unfortunately, XCOM  suffers in overall fit and finish.
  Negative
For instance, placing grenades and rockets precisely where you want them will still devolve at times into a hunt for the perfect pixel.
  Positive
The game's bullet-time effects are gorgeous, except for the times when there's a wall in the way that completely obscures the action.
  Positive
More than a few times messages popped up over units without any text inside, and the game has a nasty habit of grinding to a standstill while the AI considers its next move, while someone fires a gun or merely takes a step forward.
  Very negative
The most irritating thing I discovered in XCOM  was the ghost of an annoying save game bug found in the Enemy Unknown.
  Negative
If you have too many save files it jumbles them up and gets their timestamps wrong.
  Negative
While I never lost a save as a result of the bug, it was challenging to find where I left off from day to day.
  Negative
The only solution was to selectively delete saves every so often to keep them at a minimum, but in this day and age that shouldn't be something I have to worry about.
  Negative
The environments in XCOM  are richly detailed and much more diverse than those found in Enemy Unknown.
  Positive
That's in part because they're procedurally generated to be different every single time.
  Neutral
But they also benefit from an exceptional amount of set decoration.
  Positive
The spots I enjoyed the most were the ruined suburban spaces, because they told the story of what's happened to humanity over two decades of alien rule.
  Negative
Makeshift wood gas fuel cells power broken-down SUVs.
  Negative
Burned out buildings sulk below sunken roofs.
  Negative
Rain barrels huddle next to salvaged solar panels.
  Negative
Every once in awhile I would catch a glimpse of tattered XCOM posters pinned to bedroom walls or a bit of inspirational graffiti.
  Negative
By keeping my Avenger flying I was giving the people of Earth hope for a better future, and the game world reflected it.
  Positive
In spite of a few glaring technical issues, XCOM  represents a high-water mark for the entire franchise.
  Positive
Firaxis successfully tells an evocative story.
  Positive
It treats players with respect and includes so many small quality of life improvements over the original they are simply too numerous to mention.
  Negative
It is challenging enough at its basic difficulty level to feel like a complete experience.
  Negative
Despite the bugs, it's still the best-looking, most exciting turn-based tactical game I've ever played.
  Positive
here.
  Neutral
After having spent additional time with the game post release it's clear that XCOM  is still a tremendous single-player experience.
  Positive
However, numerous issues with the game have forced us to lower our initial, provisional review.
  Neutral
First the good news.
  Positive
The one post-release bright spot is XCOM 's Steam Workshop integration, where the community has begun to churn out interesting content including apparel, weapons, enemy units and new classes for your troops.
  Negative
Unfortunately, the graphical and gameplay bugs brought up in our initial review of XCOM  continue to persist, despite the best efforts of the team at Firaxis.
  Negative
In addition to the issues mentioned in the original review, I also ran into bugs I'd not experienced since weeks prior to the game's release.
  Negative
Making matters worse, it's clear I'm not the only person experiencing these issues.
  Negative
Anecdotal accounts paint a picture of users with various hardware configurations experiencing similar issues.
  Negative
After multiple patches, issues continue to persist as reported on the game's Steam discussion page.
  Negative
Much more problematic, however, is the quality of the multiplayer component of the game.
  Negative
It is, in a word, dreadful.
  Very negative
Hour-long matches are the norm, plagued by turns that each drag on for five minutes or longer while the action on the screen is completely out of sync with what users are actually doing in real-time.
  Negative
The graphical flourishes and exotic camera angles that make the single-player game so thrilling are largely absent.
  Positive
In fact, the isometric camera rarely follows the action at all.
  Neutral
You've got to manually move it around to keep track of your opposition.
  Positive
The in-game voice chat is so laggy as to be completely useless.
  Negative
Of the matches I attempted, I was able to complete fewer than half before my opposition logged off due to frustration.
  Negative
Overall, while it's possible to avoid multiplayer entirely and muscle through some of the more persistent graphical hitches, there are still significant technical issues with XCOM .
  Neutral
