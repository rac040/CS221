secure the ball and the Patriots' fourth world championship.
  Neutral
pulled off against Dallas in a Sunday night game.
  Negative
Beckham, his left arm grabbed by a Cowboys defender, leaped, stretched out his right arm like a bullrider hanging on for dear life and, nearly supine, made a one-handed grab as he fell into the end zone.
  Negative
In Madden , not only are you given specific tools to make your defender do the same things as Butler, if your passes are not thrown with extreme care, and use at least one of the passing commands quarterbacks have, your play will likely end up as bereft as the Seahawks in the Super Bowl.
  Negative
Even from the -yard line.
  Neutral
The very same thing happened to me.
  Neutral
Yet you'll also be given the tools that Beckham displayed to make seemingly impossible plays.
  Neutral
There are other modest refinements the career suite where most Madden gamers spend their time, and there's a new, fiendishly entertaining fantasy-draft game that links to Madden's long-running Ultimate Team mode.
  Positive
In the end, it's how this edition of Madden handles the obligations and hazards of passing and catching, forgiving some big-play excesses, that set it apart from its predecessors, and make the whole game a newly respectable challenge even to the most jaded power user.
  Negative
Directional passing  that is, leading a receiver to one side, or throwing a ball high or low  has long been a feature of the Madden series; so have bullet holding down a receiver's button or lob a single tap passes.
  Very negative
Madden NFL  now incorporates a set of receiving commands that don't just optimize the outcome of a pass, they're in some cases necessary to make a completion  or avoid a dreadful interception.
  Negative
As a result, I was more actively involved in catching the football, where in years past it was acceptable to button a receiver and let the AI haul it in.
  Negative
Receiving has long been a stepchild of the game's three phases throwing, running, catching and the simple way in which Madden NFL  has made it necessary is a breakthrough.
  Negative
The new commands allowed me to decide whether I wanted the receiver to simply take control of the ball giving up the chance to run further after the catch, turn upfield just before the catch in order to gain extra yards after bringing it in, or make them leap or otherwise fight for the ball to make the catch.
  Negative
All of these have their tradeoffs, and misusing a pass or catch command is as likely to end in failure as not using one at all, particularly at advanced difficulties.
  Negative
The "run after catch" command, meant to give you an extra step, will result in a dropped pass if used with a poorly rated receiver, or one running a difficult pattern.
  Positive
Choosing to make a possession-only catch will see a receiver often go to his knees to secure the grab, even with no one around.
  Negative
Defending a pass in Madden  is similar to receiving one in that a defensive back may be commanded either to play the ball the equivalent of an "aggressive" catch or the receiver hit the guy when he catches it, more or less.
  Negative
The wrong choice there will have consequences as well.
  Negative
But it's not simply a rock-paper-scissors question of making the right command against how your opponent is playing the ball.
  Negative
Computer-controlled defensive backs, just like Malcolm Butler at the Super Bowl, are smarter than ever about sniffing out plays and thwarting the primary passing target.
  Negative
Early in a career playthrough, my Colts against the CPU's Jets, I was on the three-yard line and called a play where my tight end, Coby Fleener, would take three steps and turn around.
  Negative
I threw the ball low, as it should be for such a pattern.
  Negative
I considered no other target when I snapped the ball, and still the pass was intercepted by a safety who had sneaked into the play.
  Negative
I felt Madden  somehow knew I was looking at only Fleener, just like Malcolm Butler did in the Super Bowl.
  Negative
The true measure of a sports simulation's quality is not in its highlight-reel performances or jaw-dropping statistical totals, but in the failed plays, where the human player understands he or she made a bad choice, and learns from it.
  Negative
Further, Madden's worst sin over the years has been the flab in its gameplay, the huge, unused parts that were so difficult or esoteric that a player was better off turning them over to the CPU.
  Very negative
In defensive play with last year's Madden NFL , and in receiving and passing this year, Madden's designers have made all the components of a very specialized sport pull their weight, and not be simply a game of throwing and running.
  Negative
Madden 's lone indulgence is in the acrobatic catches all receivers routinely make.
  Negative
Like its FIFA cousin, the game seems to stage-manage big plays.
  Negative
On one hand, it's good to see a player's "spectacular catch" rating acquire some meaning in standard gameplay.
  Positive
On the other, Madden  overconditions players to throw deep balls and lay on the triangleY button to lay out like Odell Beckham Jr. and try for  often making  the impossible grab.
  Negative
This could have bad consequences in online gamer behavior.
  Negative
Pulling off a one-handed catch with one of the NFL's elite receivers is fine; when I do it with Denver's -rated Cody Latimer, covered by two defenders, it feels cheap and forced.
  Very negative
The overall balance Madden  brings to the passing, receiving and defending phases of the game is on full display in my new favorite mode, Draft Champions.
  Negative
It's a wickedly clever challenge  there's no way to build or buy a super-team and annihilate the opposition on ratings alone.
  Neutral
I am told the best that one can do in the -round draft that initiates the mode, where you're given the choice of three players per round, is create a team rated  overall out of  and you're more likely to top out at  or .
  Negative
Inevitably there will be some part of your team you couldn't upgrade, as you choose players that comport more with your coach's strategy rather than a better overall talent or, worse, when you take an even more talented player at a position you already drafted in an earlier round, and play someone out of their natural position.
  Negative
After building the team, I took it against human or CPU competition in several attempts to win three straight games, with any loss ending the challenge.
  Negative
Difficulty increases in successive games versus the CPU.
  Neutral
It's a lot harder than it sounds against the computer, and against live competition, where everyone's team is effectively equal, you see who really has knowledge of their playbook and the ability to execute it.
  Positive
Draft Champions goes at the new trend in fantasy football of short-term leagues and applies it to video games marvelously.
  Negative
For the variety of competition, and teams I can create with it, I would play Draft Champions even if it didn't pay out the Ultimate Team bonuses one earns for winning games.
  Negative
Ultimate Team and Madden's other bread-and-butter mode, Connected Franchise, are upgraded mainly in how they present information for a player to manage.
  Negative
Connected Franchise addresses the warped progression system of its predecessor, though not as thoroughly as I'd hoped.
  Negative
Player confidence, a bonus or nerf to overall player performance, seems to have been minimized during a game.
  Positive
The kinds of death spirals one would see after a bad start particularly for a running back are not as prevalent in Madden NFL .
  Negative
Players also have more opportunities to earn extra experience points during a game, in addition to practice scenarios, to be applied to upgrading ratings and traits.
  Positive
Yet the new "drive goals" awarded for specific acts on each ball possession and XP payouts for season-long milestones are still scant compared to the cost for increasing or maintaining the core attributes of a position, or acquiring a true boost like the "superstar" trait.
  Negative
Also, there's still nothing to address the time-consuming task of managing XP for  players when you're hoarding the rd's to give him a super upgrade.
  Negative
You can only automate XP progression for every player on your roster which delivers incremental upgrades to their attributes or individually address each one.
  Negative
Madden NFL  also takes a small step back in how it subverts a huge user assist introduced last year.
  Negative
The new pass defending commands and the "drive goals," often focused to an individual player I had no intention of using, drew me away from using the player-lock feature that debuted in Madden .
  Negative
Player-lock was a significant improvement, as it delivered us the means to play defense from the same camera perspective as on offense, which greatly cut down on common gaffes like over-running a play or trying to tackle too soon.
  Negative
The tradeoff is the user can't switch players after the ball is snapped.
  Negative
To take advantage of the new XP goals and defensive commands, I was calling defensive plays and letting the CPU do everything until the ball was in the air, switching to a defensive back to play the pass.
  Negative
Of course, it could also be said that Madden NFL  is prodding the player to use all the components of the defense, instead of leaning on a crutch.
  Negative
Past editions of Madden have introduced new features only to retreat from them the next year.
  Negative
But Madden NFL  has taken unused and long-forsaken parts of the series' gameplay and given them meaning, delivering a truly consistent, understandable and enjoyable game after a decade in the wilderness.
  Positive
Madden NFL  is noticeably more challenging, but successes that feel earned are much more satisfying.
  Positive
here.
  Neutral
