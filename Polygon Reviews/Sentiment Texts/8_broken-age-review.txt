It's a perennial parental favorite, capable of answering "Why?"
  Neutral
without really answering "Why?"
  Negative
Broken Age's lead duo Vella and Shay may be separated by space and time but they're united by their inability to accept that classic deflection as an answer.
  Negative
That tendency to challenge "Because I said so" is the catalyst for Broken Age, Double Fine's lovely, funny new adventure.
  Positive
Well.
  Neutral
Half an adventure.
  Neutral
But we'll get to that.
  Neutral
As thrilling as it sounds being the sole human inhabitant of a galaxy-hopping spaceship, teenage Shay is bored.
  Negative
He's eating the same food every day.
  Positive
He's seeing the same views.
  Positive
The automated "missions" he's sent out on  like saving helpless villagers trapped in an ice cream avalanche by eating them to freedom  were made to entertain the child he no longer is.
  Negative
It's all an illusion, one created by the overprotective AIs that look out for him, "Mom" and "Dad."
  Positive
As the ship searches for a new home for Shay, he becomes increasingly frustrated with his current one and he begins to wonder if there's not something a little more exciting than ice cream outside the confines of his ship.
  Negative
Fellow protagonist Vella would probably be thrilled to swap with Shay and his cushy, rainbow-colored prison.
  Negative
In fact, she'd be happy to be anywhere other than her home of Sugar Bunting  Broken Age opens as Vella prepares to be sacrificed as an amuse-bouche for the demonic, gargantuan Mog Chothra.
  Negative
Stuffing the beast with young girls is a tradition, designed to buy peace for the village in exchange for a few spare debutantes.
  Negative
But Vella, understandably, can't help wondering "Why don't we just kill the damn thing?"
  Negative
The narrative connection between these two is completely opaque as the game begins, and there's no mechanical reason to swap  the two stories have no discernable impact on each other.
  Negative
You could theoretically play the story of one character to completion before switching.
  Negative
But I found swapping a great way to take a breather on a puzzle I was stuck on, a welcome addition for an adventure game of this kind.
  Positive
And what kind of adventure game is this?
  Positive
Well, classic, for lack of a better term.
  Negative
Click where you want your character to go, find an item, figure out how to cleverly use it in the world, move forward.
  Negative
Save an absence of verb-specification that's all handled contextually Broken Age isn't that different than the games Double Fine founder Tim Schafer and his team have been making for decades.
  Negative
That's deceptively reductive  as we've seen many times before, that simple formula can go very badly.
  Negative
Broken Age skirts that fate with really well-balanced and smart puzzles that are never so obtuse as to require a hint system  which is good, since there isn't one to speak of  but challenging enough that I took my fair share of breaks to stare at the ceiling and pray for more intelligence than genetics and public schools provided me.
  Negative
Broken Age was funded by diehard fans of LucasArts classics like Day of the Tentacle and more recent contenders like Ben There, Dan That, and those fans will be delighted to hear that Broken Age is a worthy successor.
  Positive
The new Double Fine adventure surpasses its predecessors in its lush presentation, which creates the illusion of a world I'd be happy to move to, or at least vacation in.
  Positive
Broken Age brings a storybook to life, one with with shades of Lane Smith's off-kilter work in The Stinky Cheese Man and other Jon Scieszka books.
  Neutral
The soundtrack is a stunner as well.
  Positive
The game's beauty made an occasional graphical bug I experienced all the more frustrating.
  Positive
From time to time, backgrounds would disappear, leaving only a startling blackness.
  Negative
Though Double Fine didn't have a solution to my issue, I'm hopeful it was isolated to my machine.
  Negative
It looks and sounds great, but characters are Broken Age's secret weapons.
  Positive
They're grounded while approaching absurdity and adversity with brave, heartfelt sincerity.
  Positive
This gives Broken Age the kind of depth that's so often lacking in other "funny" games.
  Negative
It's not working as hard for laughs as previous Double Fine games or Schafer's work before that, but that makes them all the more welcome when they come.
  Negative
Being completely spellbound as I was, I wasn't prepared for the game's first half to come to such a sudden halt.
  Negative
This is just Act , after all, with Act  due later this year.
  Negative
But finishing Broken Age as it stands feels less like watching a great TV show, where many narrative threads are closed by episode's end, and more like closing a great book halfway through and deciding to take a few months off.
  Negative
I'll admit there's a little bit of Veruca Salt in this complaint.
  Negative
This is wonderful stuff so I do, in fact, just want it now.
  Very positive
But there's also a lot of really important set up here, themes being established, conflicts being hinted at.
  Positive
I worry the impact of seeing those resolved will be blunted once so much time has elapsed upon the release of Broken Age's second act.
  Negative
That said, and maybe I'm a sadist, but I want you in this same agonizing intermission I now find myself in.
  Negative
Broken Age may be unfinished, but it's also delightful, beautiful, utterly charming and you really should play it right this second.
  Positive
Because I said so.
  Positive
here.
  Neutral
Like anyone with a heart and soul who played Broken Age Act , I've been eagerly awaiting the conclusion of Shay and Vella's adventure.
  Positive
Now that I've completed the entirety of Double Fine's return to adventure games, I have to say ... I'm a little disappointed.
  Negative
Whether or not you share my sentiment will depend on what you're looking for in an adventure game.
  Negative
For me, the beautiful worlds Broken Age Act  created and the fascinating, funny and flawed characters that inhabited them made the game special.
  Positive
Act  doesn't do much in the way of new people and lands  it's largely content to explore the people and places you've already gotten to know.
  Negative
A word of warning: If you haven't touched Broken Age since Act  was released, I would highly recommend running through it again before you pick up Act .
  Negative
There's very little in the way of recap here, and if you've been away from the world for over a year, you're likely to be a little lost.
  Negative
As Shay and Vella's worlds collide, there are some fun scenes where we see established characters meeting up.
  Positive
I especially enjoyed watching little entrepreneur M'ggie and Vella's sister Rocky team up for a fund-raising bake sale.
  Positive
But the joy of discovery so present in Act  has evaporated.
  Positive
If Act  was more concerned with providing satisfying emotional resolution for its characters, that might not be so bad.
  Negative
Instead, this second half makes an odd pivot, focusing more on complex, occasionally convoluted puzzles.
  Negative
For players who were looking for a little more cranial challenge from Broken Age, Act  will almost certainly deliver.
  Positive
That said, I think even the puzzle nuts will be annoyed by how much backtracking these solutions require especially annoying on Shay's ship, which I never got the hang of navigating.
  Negative
Taken as a whole, Broken Age is still a easy-to-recommend, extremely charming game with some lovely messages about growing up.
  Positive
But it isn't quite the landmark achievement in video game narrative I spent its year-long intermission hoping for.
  Negative
Some of Act 's puzzles are quite clever and there are some great gags throughout.
  Positive
But Act  had so much narrative promise, I couldn't help but be disappointed to see Broken Age's poignant story bogged down by so much puzzling it its second half.
  Very negative
