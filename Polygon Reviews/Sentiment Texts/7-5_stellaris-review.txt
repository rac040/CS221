Stellaris last year, I found myself asking if, in an already crowded category, we really needed another space strategy game.
  Negative
Now, after spending more than a week with the final product I have my answer.
  Neutral
No, we dont need another space strategy game.
  Neutral
Not now, at least.
  Neutral
What we need is a slightly better Stellaris.
  Positive
Its a fantastic platform, a capable, flexible sandbox that's customizable inside and out.
  Positive
But as technically competent as it is, some of its key systems are frustratingly incomplete, and the game is lacking in personality.
  Negative
Stellaris is a grand strategy title from the leading developer in the genre.
  Positive
Set in a single, two-dimensional galaxy thats randomly generated at the beginning of every game, it pits players against a dozen or more AI-controlled factions.
  Negative
The presentation of the three-dimensional objects on the map is gorgeous, with a great variety of gem-like worlds worlds that you can observe from every angle.
  Very positive
After a few post-release hotfixes, I'm happy to say that Stellaris runs smoothly at high settings on my mid-tier Windows PC.
  Negative
In fact, it's one of the most elegant and attractive strategy games I've ever played.
  Very positive
Unlike other Paradox titles, Stellaris is a x game, which stands for explore, expand, exploit and exterminate.
  Negative
Players begin on a single planet and are tasked with discovering and conquering the entire galaxy.
  Positive
It's a pausable, real-time strategy game where campaigns often run past  hours in length.
  Negative
From the very start, Stellaris overwhelms you with options.
  Positive
The empire creation system allows players to select from mammalian, reptilian and avian species.
  Neutral
There are even spider-like creatures, hard-shelled mollusks and a race of sentient fungi.
  Negative
Each empire can select from a small assortment of positive and negative traits that will, for instance, boost their engineering talent or render them physically repulsive.
  Negative
You can even customize an empire's attitude toward other races and ideologies, opening up avenues for unique and challenging political structures within your empire.
  Negative
Would you like to play as a race of bird-like creatures who can only colonize dry, rocky desert worlds and prefer a collectivist society that worships technology?
  Negative
Then maybe try your hand at a ruling science directorate, an oligarchy of eggheads elected every  years.
  Negative
Perhaps next time around you'd like to conjure up a society of floating, spore-like creatures who are fanatic, warlike xenophobes.
  Negative
If that's the case, you can explore the challenges of managing a military republic with a five-year election cycle.
  Positive
For completionists looking to experience everything the game has to offer, expect many challenging campaign playthroughs.
  Neutral
Once you've winnowed down your options, Stellaris uses each of these traits to spin a unique tale for you and your society.
  Positive
The way your people react to discoveries, events and other races is tailored to choices that you've made in the pre-game setup.
  Negative
The result is an experience that encourages role-playing on a grand scale and rewards players with early-game technologies and buffs for leaning in to those roles.
  Very positive
In that early game, Stellaris excels at making exploration fun.
  Positive
As your science vessels go off in search of new worlds, random events and encounters crop up.
  Negative
It feels very much like best episodes of Star Trek are playing out in miniature while you do the heavy lifting of managing your empire.
  Positive
Each science vessel requires a scientist to captain it.
  Negative
In Stellaris scientists are very much leaders, on par with presidents, planetary governors, admirals and generals all of which you can recruit over time.
  Negative
As the years go by, many of your leaders will come and go.
  Positive
Some will die of old age and others  like those on your science vessels  will meet a grisly fate among the stars.
  Negative
But aside from a few buffs to your stats, these individuals don't have much of a personality.
  Negative
Neither do the other races in the game.
  Neutral
Aside from a few recycled one-liners, conversing with other empires is one of the least interesting parts of Stellaris.
  Negative
Diplomacy, for all of Stellaris claims of background complexity and ever-evolving allegiances, has been a very binary affair in my experience.
  Negative
Either an alien race loves you or hates you, and it seems to go on doing that one thing forever.
  Neutral
It's hard for me to tell if I'm doing diplomacy "right" or "wrong" because theres rarely any feedback on what other empires want in exchange for important bargaining chips like border agreements and technology.
  Negative
Its a bit like playing go fish, hoping to eventually stumble upon the one card the competition is missing from their hand.
  Negative
Since making friends is sometimes tedious in Stellaris, its often more expedient to just declare war and take what you want.
  Negative
As far as combat goes, Stellaris is pretty light on tactical complexity.
  Positive
Battles happen automatically once two enemy fleets are in range and end when one of them retreats or is destroyed.
  Negative
With a myriad of hull options and weapons systems on offer, ship building seems nuanced, but Stellaris makes almost no effort to explain this complicated process.
  Negative
Without solid guidance, my rule of thumb has been to crank up the damage as high as it will go and charge into battle.
  Negative
Perhaps with time, trial and error someone smarter than me will begin to make sense of it all.
  Negative
At least battles are exciting to look at.
  Positive
Missiles and lasers arc through space, ships wheel and circle one another as drop pods dart toward the surface in the final assault on populated worlds.
  Negative
But it's just for show.
  Neutral
Rarely, if ever, did I feel like I could do anything to change the outcome of an engagement other than run away.
  Negative
In Stellaris, the thrill of battle is all about the careful use of maneuver, and not every empire moves the same way.
  Positive
Each begins the game with one of three different methods of travel; either slow and steady warp drives, the ability to use a limited number of super-fast hyperlanes, or the power to travel through wormholes.
  Negative
Its these methods of travel, more than anything else, that give the various factions their personalities.
  Negative
When battling an empire that relies on warp drives, an empire with wormhole travel can feint an assault at one system to lure the enemy fleet in before instantly jumping out to launch the real attack at an undefended location.
  Negative
At the same time, once a wormhole generator is discovered it becomes a prime target for attack, as its destruction closes off access to entire sections of the map.
  Negative
In my experience, the AI has been flexible enough to do all of these things and more.
  Positive
I found great fun in seeing my fleets dash in just in time to thwart an enemy counterattack, goading the AI into attacking me at the place of my choosing and using my drive technologies to gain the best advantage.
  Negative
In the end, the decision to engage in battle at all is of absolute importance.
  Negative
I had to plan, not just for combat itself, but for the logistics of supporting that war effort.
  Negative
Outside of open war, the day-to-day management of an empire in Stellaris is straightforward thanks to a unique sector system.
  Positive
Each empire has a limit on the number of core worlds that its government can effectively support.
  Negative
For most government types that's around five.
  Neutral
Beyond that number, you must assign worlds to discrete sectors.
  Negative
These sectors are semi-autonomous regions and each can be given a focus, like industry or military, that will contribute research and materials to the greater empire.
  Negative
There's one part of Stellaris that I was extremely excited for but haven't had the opportunity to properly test: the epic multiplayer mode.
  Negative
What do I mean by epic?
  Neutral
Well, it supports up to  players in pausable real-time.
  Negative
Taking into account that a single-player campaign could last  hours, its a mode that is functionally impractical to play in one sitting.
  Negative
To do it right Id want to get everyone together, in the same space to hash out diplomacy face-to-face, for multiple days.
  Negative
Outside of a sponsored press junket  which Polygon declined to attend  its unlikely that Ill ever play the game in this way.
  Negative
But knowing its possible makes the grognard inside me smile.
  Positive
All I can say is that the multiplayer systems technically work, and I've been able to both host and connect to several online games.
  Very positive
Maybe for my next vacation Ill play multiplayer Stellaris instead.
  Negative
Sectors are not without limit, however.
  Negative
Each one is purchased from a pool of points called influence, which players are fed a slow drip of over the course of the game.
  Negative
These points are a clever way to pace gameplay, with the clear goal of preventing players from tinkering ad nauseum with the inner working of their empire to minmax their way to victory.
  Positive
However, influence is also used to purchase things like leaders, edicts and outposts.
  Neutral
That means its possible to have science vessels idled and the construction of military bases delayed for decades while you wait to save up enough points.
  Neutral
It almost feels like the game is in need of another key resource so that the purchase of policy changes can be kept separate from hiring on leaders and building physical infrastructure.
  Negative
In the short term, perhaps thats something that Stellaris community can build into the game themselves.
  Positive
Just before launch, Paradox made the bold promise that it will be one of the most moddable games in the company's history.
  Positive
There's already talk of a proper Star Trek mod, and you can imagine any number of popular themes being applied to the game in the years to come.
  Positive
But what I'm most hoping for are official, bolt-on replacements for systems like diplomacy and ship building, which just arent quite as polished as Id like to see at release.
  Negative
Paradox has proven that it is willing to work on long timelines, and has a history of supporting its games years after launch with substantive upgrades.
  Positive
I expect that, three years from now, Stellaris will be a much improved experience.
  Positive
As far as Paradox has come from its roots in historical gaming, it needs to go just a little bit further to make this futuristic departure truly great.
  Negative
here.
  Neutral
