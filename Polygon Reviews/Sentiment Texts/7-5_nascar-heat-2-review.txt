NASCAR Heat s beefed up Career mode.
  Negative
If possible, a little too much.
  Negative
This is still a good problem for the stock-car racing simulator to face.
  Neutral
Fans have clamored for the return of NASCARs other two national series  the Xfinity Series and the Camping World Trucks Series  and many will be delighted to see them again.
  Positive
They triple the real-driver roster and vehicle fleet of NASCAR Heat , and theyre integral to the novel, if slow path the career sets forth.
  Negative
But if Career is your thing, be prepared to grind.
  Negative
Monster Games and  Games put a wrinkle on the classic up-from-nothing story of career modes, which always struggle to combine believability and fun.
  Positive
Players begin as hot seat drivers, attached to no team but getting their start with spot duty.
  Positive
NASCAR Heat  uses this to give the user reasonable objectives in their opening races.
  Negative
Fulfilling them leads to offers from real-life teams for the next season.
  Negative
There are  races, not counting any of the playoffs, in the Monster Energy NASCAR Series and the junior-circuit Xfinity Series, and  races for the trucks.
  Negative
This adds up to a lot of races before the player gets a team in the top-flight division.
  Positive
Even if the tracks change, theres a repetitive quality to it, especially when I raced the same course consecutively in the trucks and the Xfinity series.
  Negative
And all this racing becomes formidable for a driver who prefers things like longer qualifying and races long enough to require pit stops.
  Negative
No hot seat offer can be refused, and none of these events are skippable or can be simmed.
  Negative
Thats a baseline expectation in other licensed sports simulations.
  Neutral
All this makes the career of NASCAR Heat  more rigid than it should be.
  Neutral
Monster Games tries to inject a little off-the-track personality, thanks to some messages from real-life drivers, including full motion video for some, but there is very little to do in career except go to the next race as I was told.
  Negative
An upgrade tree for the career vehicle is gone; I didnt miss it much, but it was still a choice to consider.
  Positive
Two new elements take the place of upgrades.
  Positive
First, theres momentum, which is a race-to-race boost awarded for strong finishes and undamaged driving.
  Negative
And then theres a star system on each team to help hot seat drivers judge the quality of the rides theyre taking.
  Positive
Both of these are an acceptable streamlining that reasonably segregates the field, provides tougher challenge for those who want to work to improve a lower team, and even motivate a driver to trade up to a better one.
  Positive
Unfortunately, it also means the money I earned has no purpose.
  Very negative
About the only thing to manage in career was the rivalry system, which has had counterparts in earlier NASCAR games.
  Neutral
It was fun to check that and see who was beefing with me.
  Positive
I laughed when I saw Myatt Snider was MAD at me, in big red letters.
  Negative
This is because we kept qualifying in the same area and I kept bumping and pushing him out of the way, turning him into the wall at Kansas.
  Negative
Piss a driver off too much, and and they will remember it, such as when Snider shoved me out of the way after he had warned me I was racing too hard.
  Very negative
I appreciated the social media compliments on clean driving and even the glare when I knew Id done wrong.
  Negative
NASCAR Heat s structure of race, rinse and repeat still left me desperate to skip some of the lesser races, drive the bigger events or neater tracks like the dirt surface of Eldora Speedway, new to the game and see more of what the mode offered and less of what I already understood.
  Negative
Stock car diehards can be a deliberate bunch, wanting everything in a full race weekend, so they will probably find this no problem.
  Negative
But there is so much else in the rest of NASCAR Heat , it made the Career take on a grind-like quality.
  Negative
Some chunky loading times dont help, either.
  Neutral
Career is a big mode, but its not the whole game.
  Negative
Split-screen local multiplayer racing also is back and because of that, all the tracks are unlocked at the beginning they had been gated behind the speed rating a user compiles.
  Negative
The  Challenges, shorter scenarios involving famous drivers, are also unlocked and playable in any order.
  Negative
These are good decisions.
  Positive
And the challenges are more interesting, too.
  Positive
I ran out of gas with Kevin Harvick in Atlanta and won, and survived a nasty pileup in Dover and held on to fourth place with Aric Almirola.
  Very negative
This is also the only part of the game with any real commentary though the spotter does have a few extra lines.
  Neutral
Claire B. Lang of SiriusXMs NASCAR radio introduces each track and scenario, and completing it unlocks a legitimately helpful video, with the featured driver explaining how they race the course.
  Very negative
Danica Patrick helped me conquer my fear of Darlington by telling me where she slightly brakes on turn , and how close she comes to the wall exiting turn , reassuring me that I was in OK position.
  Negative
The racing action in NASCAR Heat  requires such precision, whether on a gamepad or with a driving wheel.
  Negative
Thats what gives the game a suspenseful, lean-in, hang-on kind of thrill no matter what Ive set for my goal.
  Positive
The racing AI seems to be a little more challenging, slipping into openings and blocking more aggressively.
  Negative
Big leads and multiple passes are found only on the easiest difficulty setting.
  Neutral
NASCAR Heat  is still a game where players must challenge themselves to use the advanced options if they are going to be winning and qualifying on anything above easy AI difficulty.
  Negative
The assists Monster Games put in this year now include a stability control system that novices will find helpful.
  Negative
But that assist also seems to slow the car in turns on some tracks.
  Negative
Recovering that speed  particularly for bigger trucks  is difficult even with a manual transmission.
  Negative
Unless I had a good qualifying position, stability control seemed to keep me in the middle of the pack more than passing cars.
  Negative
The games visuals remain a strength, with NASCAR fans sure to notice every little detail, such as the scratches on the rear plexiglass of a truck or the beat-up surface of Atlanta Motor Speedway.
  Negative
The lighting and atmospherics are all appropriate for the time of day these events race, and show off the new tracks in the game, like Iowa Speedway.
  Positive
Still, I did notice some things like shadows drawn in very late when I raced at Chicagoland.
  Negative
The no-frills quality of NASCAR Heat Evolution meant NASCAR Heat  had to show a little more than just great racing this year, and it does in spots.
  Negative
Theres a lot of variety in NASCAR Heat , its just more immediately seen in things like the one-off races or online multiplayer.
  Negative
Its hard to fault Monster Games and  though; wed been asking for all this stuff for years.
  Negative
But it makes me feel like Im sitting down to a nine-course meal more than a buffet.
  Negative
