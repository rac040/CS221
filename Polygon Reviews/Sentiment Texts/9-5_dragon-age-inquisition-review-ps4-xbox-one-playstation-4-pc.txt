Dragon Age   had choices that carried over from one to the next, but they presented relatively stand-alone stories.
  Neutral
Their tales of heroism were roped off to single small corners of a fantasy world whose full size was only hinted at.
  Negative
Dragon Age: Inquisition is the first true realization of that world.
  Positive
The missions and consequences of them span the whole of the known lands of Dragon Age.
  Neutral
Likewise, many plot points and characters return from previous games.
  Positive
Though it was never sold this way, Inquisition feels like part of a more tightly connected story, like a finale that ties up many of the plot threads previously left hanging.
  Negative
It is at once the culmination of everything Dragon Age has been attempting to accomplish for the last five years and a guarantee that this universe is here to stay for the foreseeable future.
  Positive
Dragon Age: Inquisition picks up after the events of Dragon Age , where the tumultuous relationship between mages and Templars boiled over into a full-on mage rebellion.
  Neutral
At the beginning of Inquisition, talks toward a peace treaty are interrupted by a magical explosion, leaving a sole survivor: the player-created main character, who will become known as the Inquisitor.
  Negative
The core of the game's story is taken up by solving the mysteries introduced in this climactic opening event.
  Positive
Why did you survive when no one else did?
  Neutral
Who caused the explosion?
  Neutral
Why has it left a hole floating in the sky giving demons easy access to the realm of men?
  Negative
The answers to these questions prove more engrossing and more world-changing than anything from the first two games.
  Positive
But in true BioWare fashion, that broader story often takes a back seat to smaller character conflicts.
  Positive
The Inquisitor pulls together a huge group of followers, including nine playable party members, and each has reams of dialogue conveying a fully developed personality.
  Positive
While I had my personal favorites, there really isn't a weak character in the bunch this time around.
  Negative
From the snarky dwarven crossbow expert Varric a returning character from Dragon Age  to deadpan mercenary Iron Bull voiced by Freddie Prinze Jr.!
  Negative
to the immature, butt-obsessed elven rogue Sera, I was pushed to spend time with and get to know every single party member.
  Very negative
Those party members also offer plenty of side quests, which sent me out into the world at large.
  Negative
Rather than a full "open world," Dragon Age: Inquisition is made up of numerous zones that I could teleport between at will.
  Negative
However, each of those zones is gigantic in and of itself.
  Neutral
In the  hours I spent playing Inquisition, I only fully completed two zones, and each of them took me around  hours of exploration, questing and monster-bashing.
  Very negative
Most of my time with Dragon Age: Inquisition was spent on the PlayStation  version.
  Negative
Despite my high praise for the game's content, I encountered some frustrating bugs that are hard to ignore.
  Negative
caused problems for other games on the console as well.
  Negative
Near the end of the review process, Sony sent Polygon a PS that had an upcoming patch pre-installed, ostensibly fixing the .
  Negative
problems.
  Neutral
We played approximately  hours on this patched PS and did not experience any crashes.
  Negative
EA says this new PSN patch will be released prior to Dragon Age: Inquisition's release date.
  Negative
Beyond the hopefully fixed crashes, I experienced a bevy of other small bugs in Dragon Age: Inquisition, such as dialogue refusing to progress until I hit the skip button or characters and clothing clipping into each other during cinematic cutscenes.
  Negative
The most hilariously annoying bug I stumbled across caused my Inquisitor's voice to change  hours into the game.
  Negative
Thankfully, I found a solution.
  Positive
EA has provided Polygon a list of bug fixes coming to Inquisition in a day-one patch, including many of the bugs mentioned here.
  Negative
While none of these problems were big enough to greatly impact my enjoyment of the game, we'll continue checking in to see how much the patch helps and if new issues are introduced.
  Negative
In the meantime, we're going to withhold our score for the PlayStation  version of Dragon Age: Inquisition.
  Negative
Inquisition's smart blend of the combat systems from Origins and Dragon Age  makes those long stretches exploring the wilderness fun.
  Positive
The real-time, action-lite combat allows you to auto-attack by holding down a trigger or use specific spells and abilities with the face buttons.
  Positive
If you need more time to plan your attacks, you can pause the fight at any moment, pull the camera back and begin issuing commands to everyone in your party one by one.
  Positive
The huge zones are also boosted by an increased sense of exploration, something that was minimized in Origins and all but nonexistent in Dragon Age .
  Negative
Inquisition's more eager approach to exploration can be summed up in one new mechanic: You can jump!
  Positive
This seemingly small addition cracks open the Dragon Age gameplay loop in unexpected ways.
  Neutral
Navigation itself becomes part of the gameplay here, whether it's figuring out how to scale a steep mountainside to reach the treasure chest you can see on top or tracking down fallen magical shards scattered across the hills and valleys of the area to open a secret temple door.
  Negative
I couldn't walk more than a dozen seconds in any direction in any zone without stumbling across some new distraction.
  Negative
The game provides a great rhythm of exploring, fighting, completing quest objectives.
  Positive
What really sets Dragon Age: Inquisition apart from the average BioWare game, though, is the sheer size of your group of followers.
  Positive
You're not pulling together a simple band of adventurers out to save the world; you're founding a faction with its own hierarchy and its own goals, an army of hundreds of people that will affect the lives of thousands more.
  Negative
Having these issues play out in real time may seem frustrating, but I ended up liking it.
  Negative
A small skirmish could take  minutes for your military advisor to resolve, while a more delicate contractual dispute in an Orlesian court could take your diplomatic ambassador  hours to remedy.
  Negative
These missions continue progressing even when the game is turned off, however.
  Negative
So even when I found the longest missions intimidating, it was great to turn on the game the next day and have a reward immediately waiting.
  Negative
In addition to the lengthy single-player, Dragon Age: Inquisition features a stand-alone co-op multiplayer mode, where you can team up with three other players picking roles among  different classes.
  Negative
Multiplayer is separate in every sense of the word; it has its own experience bars, challenges, locations and loot.
  Positive
The end result is a mode I found easy to forget.
  Negative
Multiplayer doesn't have the dialogue and plot connections to pull you through, and it also removes the tactical control, leaving you to focus on more action-y combat that isn't satisfying for long stretches with nothing else.
  Very negative
It also only contains three maps at launch.
  Negative
While there are elements of randomness to make replaying less of a bore, it seems like an obvious hole meant to be filled by paid downloadable content.
  Negative
The only really good part about Dragon Age: Inquisition's multiplayer mode is that it doesn't really take anything away from the incredible single-player experience.
  Negative
And with as long as the latter is, it may be months before you'd have time for multiplayer anyway.
  Negative
These "war table" missions, as they're called, get at the heart of what's so great about Dragon Age: Inquisition.
  Negative
It moves away from the story of a single hero all on their own and toward what the greater Dragon Age lore has always been about: a vast world of complex, interconnected political groups all at each other's throats.
  Positive
As the leader of the newest faction on the scene, I had to navigate tense alliances, delicate truces and powerful prejudices.
  Positive
As my Inquisition gained power, it became a more attractive ally and a bigger target.
  Negative
Each major decision I made felt like it had an impact, both immediately in the current well-being of my army and long-term on the Dragon Age world as a whole.
  Negative
I won't spoil the ending, of course, but I will say that BioWare successfully carries that sense of consequence all the way to and past the finish line.
  Positive
As credits roll on Inquisition, the continent of Thedas is a noticeably different place than it was when the game started.
  Negative
And depending on the decisions you make, your Thedas will be distinctly different from mine.
  Negative
here.
  Neutral
