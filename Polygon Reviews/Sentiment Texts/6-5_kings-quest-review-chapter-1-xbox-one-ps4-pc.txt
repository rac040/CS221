King's Quest brings back the adventure game series created by Roberta Williams in the s. Published under the old Sierra name, this revival by developer The Odd Gentlemen takes the form of an episodic adventure game.
  Positive
The new King's Quest begins before all the other games in the franchise, casting the player as frequent series protagonist Graham in his youth as he starts down the path to becoming a knight.
  Negative
The game is framed as a story that an elderly, bedridden King Graham is telling to his granddaughter Gwendolyn.
  Negative
The way you play King's Quest determines the tale Graham tells, which affects the advice he gives to Gwendolyn.
  Positive
The Odd Gentlemen's King's Quest is split into five chapters.
  Negative
In the spirit of the various paths available to players, editor-at-large Justin McElroy and senior reporter Samit Sarkar engage in a back-and-forth discussion of the first chapter, "A Knight to Remember."
  Positive
"A Knight to Remember" tells a story that is often charming, amusing and heartfelt, but I think I would've enjoyed it a lot more if it were more fun to actually play.
  Positive
original game  this first episode of King's Quest turns back the clock to Graham in his teenage years.
  Neutral
It's his first day in the realm of Daventry, and it's his destiny to become a knight.
  Positive
But in order to get the gig, he'll have to best four other would-be knights in a challenging, perilous tournament.
  Negative
Today marks the release of King's Quest: A Knight to Remember, but considering it's been  years since the launch of the last game in this classic adventure series, there's a good chance that a few actual grown adults out there have no familiarity with the adventures of King Graham and his family.
  Neutral
Fear not!
  Neutral
We've prepared a crash course in King's Quest that will get you prepared for The Odd Gentlemen's new take on the series and, with any luck, tempt you to revisit or visit for the first time!
  Negative
one of these classic games.
  Positive
King's Quest brings back some of the best and worst elements of old-school graphic adventure games.
  Positive
It's an inventory-based experience in which you're running  scratch that, walking  around a world and talking to people, then hunting down the items they seek so they can present you with new items that will help you on your quest.
  Negative
You'll have to solve puzzles using a mix of your wits and the contents of your inventory.
  Neutral
That quest also entails a lot of walking around Daventry, and boy, does that get old quickly.
  Negative
King's Quest makes few concessions to modern game design, and that often grinds the game to a frustrating halt.
  Negative
Daventry isn't a huge open world, but it takes a while to traverse its expanse because of Graham's leisurely gait.
  Negative
Worse still, there's no fast travel, and no in-game map.
  Negative
I'm not sure if The Odd Gentlemen wanted people to take a literal page out of gaming history and sketch their own paper map, or if the studio expected players to memorize the world's layout.
  Negative
But the worst offender is loading.
  Negative
Load screens five to  seconds long sometimes pop up when you're moving between areas, and they're almost more annoying because you don't know when to expect them.
  Negative
These problems, along with rampant screen tearing at least on Xbox One, combine to make it a chore to walk around.
  Negative
Justin, did those issues affect your time with "A Knight to Remember" as much as they did for me?
  Neutral
Absolutely.
  Neutral
We remarked after we finished the game that it was meatier than a typical Telltale episode and this is King's Quest by way of Telltale, make no mistake, but I'd estimate at least an hour of my five- or six-hour playthrough could be trimmed if it were easier to get around the world.
  Negative
This sluggish pacing hampers even the best parts of the game.
  Negative
Christopher Lloyd is predictably delightful as King Graham narrating his story even providing the puns that are a hallmark of narration in the series, but there's no way to skip dialogue you've already heard, so I ended up grinding my teeth through a lot of observations I enjoyed the first couple of times.
  Neutral
Poor pacing also sapped a lot of the fun of puzzle solving.
  Negative
There aren't a lot of particularly strenuous mental challenges in "A Knight to Remember," but they start to feel downright grueling when you have to walk through  screens of well-explored terrain just to try something out.
  Negative
We're spending quite a few inches on pacing issues, but that's only to reflect the extent to which the well has been poisoned by them.
  Negative
It's a shame, too, because there's a lot of good stuff in between the dry spells.
  Negative
A cast of talented vocal performers Wallace Shawn, Zelda Williams and The Spectacular Spider-Man's Josh Keaton as young Graham and a solid script really help King's Quest hit the right balance of goofy humor and heartfelt sincerity.
  Very positive
That said, longtime fans may feel like it goes a bit heavy on the irreverence: There are a few more shades of The Princess Bride and Monty Python here.
  Positive
"A Knight to Remember" has wonderfully odd character design and a lovely storybook aesthetic, finally delivering on the visuals that King's Quest box art has been promising since the early 's.
  Very positive
Even the UI is a smart evolution from the noun-verb text input and icon-driven interfaces of previous games.
  Neutral
Am I forgetting any high points?
  Negative
Samit: The writing is rarely laugh-out-loud funny, but more so than the humor, I appreciated  as strange as this may sound  the world-building.
  Neutral
While "A Knight to Remember" tells a pretty self-contained story, the Daventry that the episode introduces feels like a place with its own history and culture.
  Negative
The baker laments the kingdom's violent traditions, while the tournament officials proudly uphold them; the bridge trolls go on strike to protest a raw deal.
  Negative
Moreover, the developers let you do a little world-building of your own.
  Negative
"A Knight to Remember" implies that your actions can change the story, but I didn't realize until you and I talked that it's possible to finish the episode in very different ways  complete with alternate solutions for a few puzzles.
  Negative
It's really cool that there isn't one correct path through the story; some of the solutions you told me about never occurred to me.
  Negative
The puzzles in this chapter don't create many "eureka" moments, but I love that they allow for different approaches.
  Positive
Uncharted : Among Thieves.
  Neutral
Justin: Those parts aren't particularly challenging and feel a little odd in a game bearing the King's Quest name Mask of Eternity notwithstanding.
  Negative
But I found the few action setpieces really cool and hope we get to see more of them in future adventures, provided they don't start to replace the puzzle solving at the game's core.
  Positive
Justin: I'd extend that same conditional optimism to the whole of King's Quest.
  Negative
The things that The Odd Gentlemen have gotten right are very, very right; they just happen to be severely bogged down by some technical and executional missteps.
  Negative
Here's hoping as the story continues that, like the future Sir Graham, King's Quest stays sincere and silly while growing just a bit more competent.
  Positive
here.
