Dishonored game.
  Neutral
She's elevated from sob-story side-kick to protagonist.
  Neutral
It's one hell of a jump up for the street urchin who once dreamed of being a ship's captain.
  Negative
For the last game in the current series, Daud's one-time apprentice assassin is tasked with the murder of the Outsider who is, to all intents and purposes, a god among men and magicians.
  Negative
It's an intriguing proposition, given how much influence the Outsider has exerted on the various villains and heroes who have strutted this series, since it first wowed us five years ago.
  Positive
But Lurk cuts an admirable figure even against this outsized opponent.
  Positive
Whether she's slashing throats or sneaking past guards, she's strictly business, a perfect foil for her dandyish, philosophising mark.
  Positive
The only time Lurk really wanders into the realm of metaphysical self-analysis is when she's confronted with the perplexing problems of the Void and the Outsider, whose mysterious ways include offering her a helping hand in the planning of his own demise.
  Negative
But she understands revenge, and that's good enough for her.
  Positive
I like her.
  Neutral
Dishonored   to do pretty much everything Dishonored-esque.
  Positive
Lurk sneaks past people in order to capture useful things.
  Neutral
She incapacitates or murders guards if they get in the way.
  Positive
She solves find-and-fetch problems to advance her story.
  Negative
She performs magical tricks that help her slip past assailants.
  Positive
All this is executed with practised aplomb by developer Arkane, even if it all feels slightly rote.
  Negative
Those magical abilities are very slightly different than those I've played before.
  Positive
Lurk can transport herself short distances, which is a Dishonored standard, though with the additional benefit of landing inside the bodies of enemies, and exploding them from within.
  Negative
It makes a bit of a mess.
  Negative
She can also send her mind ranging away from her body, to scout out rooms and areas.
  Negative
Arkane makes much use of this trick, in terms of finding hidden loot and solving essential physical puzzles.
  Positive
Finally, she also steal the faces of people for short periods of time  Arya Stark-style  allowing her to stroll past posses of guards, so long as no-one discovers the bodies of her victims.
  Negative
This is a fun maneuver, but fraught with downsides.
  Positive
Dogs are not so easily tricked as humans, and everyone who has ever played a Dishonored game knows that dogs are a giant pain in the arse.
  Negative
Dishonored games have always been about movement, which is also the fundamental spirit of Death of the Outsider's puzzles.
  Neutral
They generally involve looking for stuff.
  Neutral
There is no shifting boxes and hardly any completing contraptions or recognizing patterns.
  Negative
Lurk's non-combat powers are essentially all about getting from A to B.
  Negative
This limits the variety of set-piece puzzles.
  Neutral
The most elaborate ones asked me to think hard about the potential of Lurk's magic tricks.
  Negative
They were rare, but satisfying.
  Positive
But Dishonored has always provided me with a huge macro-puzzle, rather than lots of little ones strung along like beads.
  Negative
The world can often be traversed different ways.
  Positive
More than this, it invites me to try different strategies at every turn.
  Negative
Sometimes I understand that the designers have set me up to do something specific, but more often, I feel like I have options.
  Positive
These options have a hierarchy.
  Neutral
It is possible to kill everyone you come across.
  Neutral
And although that isn't easy, it's nowhere near as difficult as not killing people.
  Negative
This, in turn, is a breeze compared to avoiding detection completely.
  Negative
In Dishonored, completing the game by killing everyone feels like a failure.
  Negative
Or, at the very least, it feels like a practice run for doing it properly.
  Neutral
The entire game is about half the length of a full Dishonored, coming in at around -ish hours, depending on how you play.
  Negative
its own weary systems and by forces it cannot grasp.
  Negative
The world's artfulness extends to its architecture, which offers a baffling array of rooms-within-rooms, corridors-to-nowhere and looping causeways.
  Negative
Much of this game takes place in enormous structures, crammed with useless, abandoned stuff, a gorgeously maddening playpen.
  Negative
Dishonored: Death of the Outsider by keeping my eyes peeled, and so I spend a good deal of time tracking back and re-examining dials, paintings, statues, levers and such.
  Negative
Failure to notice the right thing can lead to long periods mooching around, feeling like a fool.
  Negative
In a way, this is like a kinetic, three-dimensional Where's Waldo, in which I'm invited to pay very close attention to my surroundings.
  Negative
Dishonored games succeed because those surroundings aren't just window dressing; they're also stories.
  Positive
Yet for all its color and vibrancy, Death of the Outsider is much the same as the Dishonored games I've played before.
  Negative
It has a familiar, comfortable feel about it, which tears slightly at the series' initial and startling originality.
  Positive
The combat, the puzzles, the world and the characters are all enjoyable, but they're nothing new.
  Neutral
There's something slightly exhausted about Death of the Outsider.
  Neutral
It's like returning to a fondly-recalled vacation spot and having a nice time, but not as nice as you remember.
  Negative
We've been here before, and perhaps it's a good thing that we won't be coming back again.
  Negative
Death of the Outsider offers a standard take on the Dishonored formula, tracking closely to its admirable ethos of freedom and choice in a world of subtleties and illusions.
  Neutral
It's a decent finale with a solid central character.
  Very positive
But it makes little attempt to try anything new, a sign that all the best ideas are likely going into whatever comes next.
  Negative
If and when Dishonored returns, it will be in a different era and with new characters.
  Positive
I hope Arkane is as bold with its next work, as it was with the original game.
  Positive
