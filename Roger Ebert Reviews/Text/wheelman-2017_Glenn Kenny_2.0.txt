You cant blame genre directors for trying to mix things up now and then, experiment with a new approach, see where it goes. Unfortunately, for this viewer, the formal constraint foisted upon him by writerdirector  Jeremy Rush in Wheelman went right up his nose and stayed there, resulting in a little less than  minutes of annoyance.  The bare bones of the storyline are familiar.  Frank Grillo plays the title wheelman, a reluctant criminal arent they all working a bank robbery against his better judgment. What can he tell you? Hes less than a year out of prison, he owes money, and he has a beloved daughter who hes trying to provide for and raise right, and an irritated ex-wife who is ever one court judgment away from getting permanent custody of said daughter.      So, of course, the job hes working on is going to go very sour. Not that the wheelman initially makes life easy for himself. Driving the wet nighttime streets, he looks terribly confident and competent, and when he picks up the two bank robbers, he very aggressively high-hats them, refusing to give them a name and snootily telling them that hes not here for small talk. No, hes here to be a good dad, as his cell-phone conversations with his rebellious teenage daughter Katie tell us. I dont trust crime movies in which the lead character has some sort of fixation with being Father of the Year, but that turns out to be hardly the biggest problem here.     No, the biggest problem is the aforementioned formal constraint that writer-director Rush sets up. Deriving inspiration I presume from the  Tom-Hardy-starring drama  Locke, this is a getaway car chase movie that aspires to remain entirely within the car. Actually, within two cars, but lets not get ahead of ourselves. After the first snafu, in which Grillos wheelman leaves behind the robbers this may be a silly question but given the fact that this movie is entirely night-set, I had to wonder why the bank they knocked over was open so late, he is obliged to play cat and mouse with a variety of unknown-number phone callers, all of whom are abusive and make terrible demands of him. They also all sound as if theyve been doing  Goodfellas karaoke.     For what seems like hours, these various characters exchange Who are yous, where are yous, wheres my moneys, fk yous, fk you motherfers, and so on. Mr. Rush doesnt seem to grasp that one reason Locke worked was that even though it stuck with one man in one car talking to a variety of people, those people were articulately voiced. More than that, they were brilliantly acted' one of the characters was played by  Olivia Colman. And the movies writerdirector Edward Knight had crafted a multi-leveled, suspenseful storyline to be talked through.        Also, having set up this formal constraint, Rush cant even stick with it. The wheelman has to have a sit down with his initial contractor, a guy named Clay. So, he pulls up to the bar where Clay is at, and the camera sits in the car, waits, and captures the wheelman dragging Clay Garrett Dillahunt into the car, so they can talk. At this point, classic film lovers will know what I mean when I say, Gun Crazy this is not.     Your mileage may vary, particularly if youre a fan of lead actor Grillo, whose work in a couple of Marvel pictures has earned him one of those cult followings you could call ancillary, no offense to Mr. Grillo. But whatever Wheelman does, it wont propel him to anything beyond that status.
