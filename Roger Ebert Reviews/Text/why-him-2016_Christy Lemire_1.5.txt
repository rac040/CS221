The title of the movie is Why Him?, your first indication that this raunchy R-rated comedy is far more interested in the men engaged in battle across generational, emotional and socioeconomic lines than it is about the woman at the center of the fight. That woman, by the way, is a bright and bubbly Stanford University senior played by  Zoey Deutch a character of ambition and theoretical agency. But the likable actress see: Everybody Wants Some!! is relegated to functioning as more of an idea and a pawn than anything else. Why Him? spends more time and energy SO much energy on the age-old struggle between an overprotective father and the eager-to-please young man who hopes to become his son-in-law. Bryan Cranston and  James Franco are stuck in these one-note roles, respectively, in what is a one-joke movie. Director and co-writer  John Hamburg, creator of the Fockers franchise, borrows liberally from himself here, making slight tweaks to the central dynamic of those films while upping the gross-out factor. Cranston is uptight and overprotective' Franco is unfiltered and overpowering. Why Him? hammers that central notion, hard, for nearly two hours. But were supposed to find both of these characters adorable or at least admirable because of one line from Deutchs character, Stephanie, which suggests perhaps theyre not as different as they seem because theyre both truly authentic, for better and for worse. Theyre at least consistent, thats for sure. Cranstons Ned Fleming is the longtime owner of a Michigan printing business, which has been suffering lately in this age of digital greetings. Why Him? plays his Midwestern folksiness for easy, condescending laughs from the very start with a celebratory scene at Applebees. But he agrees to travel to California for Christmas, along with his chipper wife, Barb  Megan Mullally, and their teenage son, Scotty  Griffin Gluck, to meet their daughters new boyfriend. That would be Francos Laird Mayhew, who Stephanies parents dont realize is a  years older than she is, and b a tech billionaire. Laird lives in a ridiculous, minimalist monstrosity high in the hills above Silicon Valley, where various employees, hangers-on, celebrity chefs and farm animals wander in and out during the day. Why Him? has nothing to say about the grotesquerie of such a nouveau riche display' these are just random ideas that flit by. Although  Kaley Cuoco as the voice of Justine, Lairds intrusive, in-house version of Siri, doesnt seem like a possibility thats too far away. Keegan-Michael Key gets the films few laughs as Gustav, Lairds right-hand man, concierge and personal trainer. A running bit in which Gustav attacks Laird out of nowhere to keep him sharp and hone his parkour skills might have been amusing if the script from Hamburg and  Ian Helfer didnt feel the need to spell out its similarity to the relationship between Inspector Clouseau and Cato. Jokes are just so much funnier when you explain them afterward, right? But reining Laird in is impossible hes all impulse with his puppyish enthusiasm and profane chatter. He wants desperately to gain Neds approval because Barbs clearly doesnt matter but risks alienating him instead. Oddball characters are Francos bread and butter hes repeatedly shown hes game for whatever weirdness is required of him but hes afforded no nuance here. Hes just extreme and exhausting. Cranston, meanwhile, is hemmed in on the opposite end of the spectrum. Ned is judgmental and inflexible, with repeated references to how much he and Barb love the band KISS serving as the only indication that he was ever any fun. Anyway, after an increasing cavalcade of flatly crass visual gags featuring high-tech toilets, moose urine and poorly-timed sexual shenanigans, Why Him? collapses the way so many R-rated comedies do. It goes soft and nice and wants us to care about these characters who barely resemble human beings. After all, its Christmas. But everyone involved here should have asked Santa for a stronger script.
