Love, Rosie is one of those annoying movies in which everything would be just fine if the two central characters had a simple conversation that cleared up all their misunderstandings. But then, there would be no movie  although, in retrospect, that might not be such a bad thing. Instead, we get contrivances and coincidences, near-misses and almost-theres. This cosmic confluence of events, which takes place over a dozen years, is meant to be swoony and tragic but is actually more irritating than anything else. That the actors playing our would-be lovers  Lily Collins  Mirror Mirror and  Sam Claflin the Hunger Games movies are appealing individually and have decent chemistry together helps make this thoroughly mediocre British romantic comedy more tolerable than it ought to be. Director  Christian Ditter offers some artful touches in adapting Cecelia Aherns novel Where Rainbows End. The lighting is often quite lovely, for example streaks of late-afternoon sunshine in a park, or lamplight filling a darkened bedroom. But for every delicate element there are many others that are heavy-handed or cringe-inducing, including some painfully on-the-nose musical selections. Salt-N-Pepas perky Push It plays while Collins character, Rosie, is giving birth. Get it? Because shes pushing! But the tonal transition that occurs before that scene from a sweet and quiet moment of Rosie bonding with her sizable bump to the noisy wackiness of her screaming through delivery is reflective of the kind of jarring shifts that often make this movie so uneven. The script from  Juliette Towhidi begins in the present day, with Rosie making a speech at a wedding, then flashes back to reveal the lifelong friendship shes shared with Claflins Alex. The two have been inseparable since they were  years old' then at Rosies  th birthday, they briefly and drunkenly kissed after too many tequila shots. The spark is clearly there. But in the ensuing years, each has managed to become involved with other people who are just as clearly wrong for them. These arent just ill-advised dalliances theyre aggressively bad picks, depleting the film of even the slightest shred of tension as to its outcome. Alex has a penchant for vapid, leggy blondes. Rosie romps with her thoughtless, pretty-boy prom date and winds up pregnant after a condom mishap. And heres one of the many places where Love, Rosie takes a detour into territory that isnt just distractingly unbelievable' its downright stupid. Rather than tell her best friend that shes expecting, Rosie keeps this information from Alex because shes afraid it will prevent him from heading to Harvard to study medicine. Or something. Boston was their shared dream shed planned to study hotel management at Boston College although she also mentions Boston University, which is an entirely different place but now hell have to go alone while she secretly changes diapers. They grew up across the street from each other in an insular neighborhood' the notion that he wouldnt find out she has a baby is absurd. But whatever. We need to move on there are so many other problems here.   Years pass. Alex stays in Boston, ostensibly trying to forge a medical career, although we never actually see him studying or caring for patients. Rosie, following in her fathers footsteps, takes a job as a chambermaid at a posh hotel with dreams of opening her own cozy inn someday.  Jaime Winstone Rays daughter, as Rosies co-worker and best friend, livens things up while dialing down the clichs of the wisecracking sidekick. And yet: Their conversations definitely dont pass the Bechdel test. Despite the fact that shes a grown woman and a mother now, all Rosie can talk about is Alex. More years pass. Rosie and Alex visit each other across the Atlantic. They send instant messages and text. They flirt and fight and eventually make up but first, Rosie returns home, feeling gloomy, to the obvious strains of Gilbert OSullivans Alone Again Naturally. Yet the cruel forces of nature conspire to keep them apart. These include the father of Rosies now--year-old daughter, who returns to the picture just in time to steal an actual handwritten letter from Alex and then stuff it in a drawer to keep her from reading his confessions of love. We just keep missing each other! Rosie laments tearfully toward the films end. Collins and Claflin have a few moments that seem honest and effortless enough to make you wish for them to end that streak, but not nearly enough.
