This is not a sad story. Thats what you are thinking, isnt it. Dont be so presumptuous young lady. That  thought was what I was really thinking during the opening moments of  Louder Than Words, as a -year-old girl with a Medusa-like explosion  of dark curls and a preternaturally smugger-than-thou smile rides her  bike on an impossibly sunshine-drenched day .  Best  get used to Maria Olivia Steele-Falconer as she persists in narrating  this truth-based tale that would barely cut it on the Hallmark Channel.  Prepare for her to materialize in flashbacks even after she tragically  expires from a rare case of bat rabies. She is like an irksome version of Clarence the angel from Its a Wonderful Life. Except, in this  case, it is more like its a wonderful death. One that inspires her  high-strung New England family, whose torturous taste in taupe-heavy  dcor practically shouts dysfunction, to build what I am sure is a  terrific childrens hospital in Marias memory. Not  that Louder Than Wordsthey are taking action, get it?much  cares about allowing us to share in the joy of sick kids and their loved  ones benefiting from this state-of-the-art pediatric facility in  Valhalla, N.Y. The end results are relegated to a smattering of sketches  and snapshots along with assorted captions over the end credits.  Instead of closure, we are urged to instead focus on the over-privileged  Fareri family, whoat least in this films incarnationmakes the  distraught upper-class clan in  Ordinary People seem like the Waltons. Lets  make one thing clear right here. I am not normally a cynic and I abhor  the impersonal, drab and cramped confines of many health-care facilities  as much as anyone. And that the tragic loss of a child bettered the  world in some way is fine with me. But instead of celebrating that  accomplishment, Louder Than Words goes out of its way, and almost  takes pride in, eschewing actual heartfelt emotionsso much so that,  by the end, it is hard to even care. Shots of pretty autumnal leaves,  sometimes dripping with tear-like raindrops, and other fancy camera  tricks do little to fill in the blanks. In  other words, this is no Lorenzos Oil, a superior reality-based drama  from  about another family who challenged the accepted norms of the  medical community.  Instead,  we have  David Duchovny, one of the least-emotive actors ever, typecast  as John Fareri, a man who builds a wall around his thoughts and  feelings. This commercial developer who revels in always getting his way  there is a snide comment at one point about how he likes to steamroll  over the concerns of environmentalists is an enigma to his indulgent  business-partner and decorator wife, Brenda  Hope Davis, a fine actress  saddled with a hopeless role, as well as to his two college-age  daughters and only son, who happen to be triplets.    But  not to Maria, for she is the self-declared glue who holds them all  together and a child of wonder who illuminates her fathers universe. He  willingly reveals to his favorite child the very principle that guides  his life and work: Its easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.  Translation: I will do whatever I want and apologize later. Nice  guy, that John. OK  then. By the time a half-hour or so ticks by, our heroinewho, while  annoyingly precocious, has more of a pulse than any of the other  performers onscreenhas already met her demise. But not before, in a  series of disjointed scenes, she shows off her outgoing personality by  singing a little ditty with her pals, confessing she has a crush on a  boy and joking around with her father, who barely ever acknowledges  his other offspring, while fishing together on a two-person camping  trip. The very outing, apparently, that led to her being exposed to the  fatal disease. Now  grief-stricken, the rest of the family drifts farther apart. Dad  becomes more of a non-presence than ever while Mom goes on mad cleaning  sprees. The moody daughter runs off to Seattle with her boyfriend. And,  at a Boston college, the scholarly daughter finds refuge in her school  work while her brother skips his classes and mopes. At least the  siblings share one bond: chain-smoking. But  then John decides to flip through Marias journal while in her shrine  of a bedroom. He spots the mention of an English class assignment asking  her to write about her wish. Although being a star or a famous  scientist are her initial thoughts, she settles on: I wish for the  health and well-being of all the children of the world.  When  a zombie-esque Duchovny isnt busy staring off into space, his John is  making haphazard attempts to allow Marias dream to come true by coming  up with a hospital plan.  He  brings in a specialist  Timothy Hutton, who at least provides a smile  or two but fails to include or even inform his wife of his efforts.  Eventually, plates are smashed, voices are raised and the healing  begins. As for the project, after several hurdles such as recruiting  members of their well-off community as donors, John and Brenda succeed  with what seems like an average amount of handwringing to make the  proposal a realitydespite the fact it actually took nine years to  complete.  What  is harder to achieve than building a hospital? Producing a realistic movie  about coping with grief by helping othersat least for the filmmakers  behind Louder Than Words.
