MikeandDaveNeed Wedding Dates confuses repetitive raunchiness with daring humor. It hammers us over the head with the same handful of jokes in hopes of beating us into submission.Andit strains the screen appeal of a group of actors who normally are enormously likable. The film marks the feature-directing debut of  Jake Szymanski, who previously directed several segments for  Saturday Night Liveandonline shorts for Funny or Die. He shows some strong instincts at the start as he introduces these charactersandsets up this world, but has trouble maintaining the same uproarious energy level for the duration of the film. The script from  Andrew Jay CohenandBrendan OBrien, co-writers of the similarly no-holds-barred Neighbors movies, is loosely based on a series of actual events, which also inspired a book. But very little here resembles anyone or anything youd recognize in real life. BrothersMikeAdam DevineandDaveStangle  Zac Efron really did take out a Craigslist ad to find dates to their cousins wedding,andthat ad really did go viral. Here, the cousin has been changed to a younger sister, Jeanie  Sugar Lyn Beard,andthe wedding has been moved to Hawaii to up the levels of expectation, ostensibly. In a well-staged opening sequence, which contrasts whatMikeandDaverecall as delightful family bonding time with the disastrous reality, we learn why everyone wants these guys to bring nice girls to the wedding. Theyre a train wreck, albeit a well-intentioned one. They meet their matches in trashy best friends Tatiana  Aubrey PlazaandAlice  Anna Kendrick, who are just as much of a hot mess. Tatiana is the wild-eyed, trash-talking alpha of the duo, while Alice is the sweetly perky yet aimless sidekick still reeling from being jilted at the altar. Were forced to watch along with Alice as she tortures herself with multiple viewings of the iPhone video of that tragic moment' the repetitious nature of this early, unfunny gag is a harbinger of things to come. TatianaandAlice seeMikeandDavediscussing their search on TVandput down the bong long enough to hatch a plan to meet them accidentally outside a Manhattan bar. This requires them to clean upandconcoct wholesome back stories for themselves, which amusingly taxes Alices ability to tell convincing lies. There is definitely an allure to seeing Kendrick play against type as a bad girl. She was sort of inching in that direction andaway from her prim persona with the original  Pitch Perfect movie as a low-key, anti-social DJ. It may not be the most ideal fit for her talent, but its still fun to see her stretch.   The scenes in which sheandPlaza vaguely try to make something of their livesandor sit around on the couch, hoping to convince themselvesandeach other of how awesome they are, are the films highlights. TatianaandAlice are far more compelling thanMikeandDaveas they co-optandupend bro culture. Plaza is game for anything,andthese two likable actresses have an easy, zany chemistry with each other. Then they meetMikeandDave andin theory, sparks should fly, because TatianaandAlice are their female equivalents. But MikeandDave Need Wedding Dates is never nearly as subversive as it thinks it is,andby the end, everyone tones it downand learns to be a grown person. Its not exactly a spoiler' these hard-R comedies tend to go softandgooey by the conclusion. Were supposed to find these guys lovable but theyre actually just adolescent idiots, even though EfronandDevine each have been consistently charismatic in the past with better writing. Devine, the Workaholics co-star, works his fast-talking, manic shtick,andEfron continues demonstrating his willingness to toy with his pretty-boy persona the farther he strays from the Disney Channel. Despite their efforts, MikeandDave Need Wedding Dates offers raunch with no smarts. Its not content merely to present increasingly shocking sight gags, such as the thoroughly inappropriate massage the bride receives at the resorts spa from the naked andlimber  Kumail Nanjiani, a one-note bit that gets dragged out ad infinitum. Theres also the moment when Tatiana reluctantly pleasures the brothers bisexual cousin Alice Wetterlund in the steam room in exchange for backstage passes to Rihanna whom the film repeatedly refers to by her nickname, Ri Ri, which is just super edgy.Andthen theres the nude, drug-induced incident involving the horses at the resorts stables. Showing these events once isnt enough, though. The movie keeps referring back to them, over and over, as if reminding us about jokes we just saw will make them funny all over again if they ever were in the first place. Similarly, merely making references to pop culture phenomena does not count as humor, such as an extended andill-fated homage to  Jurassic Park, or the acknowledgement of this movie's debt to the superior  Wedding Crashers. Andthen there are the outtakes. Good lord, the outtakes. Dont we all see through these by now? Sure, its a clever way to keep us in our seats during the credits instead of running out to the bathroom, but they are never funny. Here, this is especially true. Hearing crew members cackling in the background doesnt automatically make these moments hilarious.
