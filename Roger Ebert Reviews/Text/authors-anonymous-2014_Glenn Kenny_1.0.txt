Movie lovers were understandably sad that the great character actor  Dennis Farina died last year. Movie lovers SHOULD be royally ticked off that the great character actor Dennis Farina was apparently spending the twilight of his career appearing in dreck like "Authors Anonymous," which according to varied sources on the Internet, was his second-to-last movie. As the title for this remarkably limp and obvious ensemble comedy suggests, "Authors Anonymous" is about a writers group. That is to say, a group of wannabe scribes who meet together and workshopcritique each others works, each member nurturing, if not outright milking dry, the hope of finding representation, publication, and best sellerdom. First-time-credited screenwriter  David Congalton, ignoring the rule about how if one wants to make fun of the aspirations of other writers, one ought to check oneself and ones talent pretty mercilessly before even setting down word one, peoples this group set in the literary hotbed of Los Angeles with exceptionally predictable types. Farina plays a tough-guy  Tom Clancy wannabe.  Chris Kleins a Fitzgerald devotee whos also a pizza delivery boy.  Teri Polos a flighty Danielle Steel wannabe, I think'  Dylan Walsh is her optometrist husband whos Polos top enabler. Jonathan Bennets a Bukowski wannabe sample dialogue, or rather monologue, because, cleverly enough, "Authors Anonymous" indifferently adopts the conceit of being a documentary about its characters: I am here because of Bukowski.  Charles Bukowski. Greatest writer ever. Period. L.A. is his town, man. If Im gonna be a writer, you know, Ive gotta walk in Bukowskis shoes, man. So, see, setting the movie in Los Angeles really DOES make sense. And  Kaley Cuoco of "The Big Bang Theory" fame and Internet shut-in lust plays an airhead whos never heard of  Jane Austen. So guess which member of the group gets an agent and a book deal and a six-figure movie deal? If you guessed, you really dont need to see this movie. If you didnt, you really dont need to see this movie. Seriously. The scene depicting a book signing at a hardware store seemed, to me, this movies peak bottom, if you will, but by that point the picture still had  minutes to go. Farinas talent is thrown away here' Cuoco is funnier on her sitcom' Klein and Polo you just kind of feel bad for. Hence, the only reason to watch this picture is for the novelty value of feeling bad for Chris Klein andor Teri Polo. To each his own, but my recommendation is "pass."
