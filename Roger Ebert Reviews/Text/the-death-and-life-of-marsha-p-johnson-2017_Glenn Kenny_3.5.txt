The documentary director  David France made an impressive feature documentary debut in  with How To Survive A Plague, which took the very complex history of AIDS activism in the U.S. and made a cogent, angry, and inspiring narrative of it. His new film, The Death and Life of  Marsha P. Johnson, appears at first to take a more macro perspective on gay rights. But it tells a big story indeed.  Johnson, who died in , and who the police declared a suicide after her body washed up near the Christopher Street pier where she spent much time, a day or so after her actual death, was a drag queen who was born Malcolm Michaels in . Marsha, friendly, extroverted, outrageous, lived the sort of itinerant life not uncommon to trans people in New York in the s, s, and beyond. She lived in poverty but at the same time floated with the so-called Beautiful People, including the Warhol crowd. She was one of the principle figures of the Stonewall Riots in the summer of . At that time, just going out on the street in broad daylight in drag, or as a trans person, was a form of activism, but Marsha did more. Until her mysterious death.      The film sketches this out for the viewer before cutting to the present day, and to the offices of New York Citys Anti-Violence Project. There, a trans woman named  Victoria Cruz, whos worked there since the late s, after she herself was the victim of assault at a nursing home where she worked, is preparing for retirement. But she has some unfinished business to attend to. Like almost everyone else outside of the official authorities, she doesnt believe that Marsha P. Johnson killed herself. She decides to pursue this cold case. Justice for Marsha, she says several times.     Here, France begins constructing a narrative that sticks to you like a good TV crime drama. Victoria visits people from the life, so to speak, in various locations. In Hoboken, she speaks to Randy Wicker, who took in Marsha as a roommate in the s. One queen, Miss Kitty, is interviewed in a prison facility.  Sylvia Rivera, Johnsons good friend and another Stonewall veteran, died in the s, but Frances use of archival footage of her is startling. All the while the movie pertinently juxtaposes the past with the present, showing the trial of the man who, in , beat to death Islan Nettles on the street, after says his lawyer experiencing panic at the realization that she was a trans person.     These days theres a conspicuous show of unity in gay rights movements' LGBTQ fits under one rainbow-patterned umbrella. The extent to which this is equally true everywhere is something Im not privy too. But its a fact that in the s and beyond, non-cross-dressing gays were not necessarily eager to have trans people in the movement. The movie doesnt shy away from this' it includes some startling footage of Rivera at Washington Square Park, fiercely dressing down a crowd at a rally. I felt the movement completely betrayed the drag queens and street people, she says in interview footage.        In the present-day sequences, Cruz continues to rack up evidence of foul play. Phone calls are featuredin which thick-accented, hostile-sounding retired New York City police officers hang up on her. Post-it notes on her office corkboard are tacked in vertical succession: Dirty cop, Mob, and so on. The ecology of the s gay bar is examined. These were all mob-owned, but the operators werent made men' as one historian explains, these venues were entrusted to barely competent family cousins in need of an occupation.     These tendrils are all fascinating, but the main thrust of the picture is emotional. Cruz frequently takes her notes and sits in a booth at Julians, one of the most iconic gay bars of the old days, still standing all these years later. As she looks at Marshas case she also tells the viewer her own history. Now stocky, blind in one eye, but still handsome, commanding, she shows off pictures of herself in the s, model-beautiful, a queen who could pass but would be subject to shunning and worse were her secret to be discovered. The movie reminds the viewer how far weve come, but also how far we have yet to go. It celebrates the heroism of people who died for what should never have been considered either heroic, or a sin: the right to just be themselves.
