"Kuso," a trippy collection of surreal comedy sketches, feels like a variety show from another planet. It's a noisy, lumpy collection of gross stuff that is vaguely thematically related, but only bystream-of-conscious logic. This presents a problem: how seriously should we take such a puzzling, fitfully fascinating collection of barely developed ideas, many of which center on bodily fluids, human waste, and rotting body parts? Written, scored and directed by formidable hip-hop artist  Flying Lotus AKA: Steve Ellison, "Kuso" is too proudly low-brow to be art gallery material. But you can see a level of consideration and personality here that sometimes puts this film leagues ahead of anything that's being done by contemporary post-dada pop surrealists like  Tim Heidecker,  Eric Wareheim, Eric Andre, and many other stoner-friendly comedians who regularly crank out bizarro outsider art for Cartoon Network's late-night Adult Swim off-shoot. "Kuso" may often feel unproductively loud, and monotonous, but it is a head-scratcher worth contending with. Produced over the course of two-and-a-half years, "Kuso" is a roiling stew of Flying Lotus's creative influences, some of whom have cameos in the film, like Heidecker and FunkadelicParliament co-founder  George Clinton. All the events you seeare somehow precipitatedby a catastrophic Los Angeles earthquake. Beyond that, the only thingholding these scenes together are Ellison'srecurring fixations with scab-and-pustule-encrusted nebbishes, and insects that emerge from rectal orifices. Watching "Kuso" consequently feels like an excavation of the many subterranean chambers of Ellison's anally-fixated imagination. A bald child with facial deformities eats and prays with his grotesque mother, then ventures into the woods and rubs his own waste on the mysterious creature that inhabits a mossy knoll that looks like a gaping anus.

Cl-- Wait, what was that last one? Your brain struggles to make connections between these segments because each subplot is broken down into three -to five episodes each, cut up, and spread out over the course of the film. But the diced-up juxtaposition of thesesegments necessarily prevents them fromgelling together, so theynever cohere into a bigger picture. I can commend Ellison for singular set pieces, like the film's inspired opening musical number, or a weirdly intimate earlysex scene. I could also lament dismal gags, like anything involving Heidecker, a blow-up doll, and aliens.   I could also rattle off any number of Ellison'ssalient influences, like Clinton, H.R.Giger, William Burroughs,  David Cronenberg, Marcel Duchamp,  Crispin Glover,  Danny Elfman, Alejandro Jodorowsky, and Monty Python. Or I couldmake comparisons to Clinton's"Cosmic Slop,Oingo Boingo's "Forbidden Zone," orKool Keith's "Dr. Octagonecologist." But the main thing about "Kuso" is that it feels like a deliberate attempt at frustrating your ability to make connections. Characters smear their waste on each other's faces. They don't make eye contact, and often talk past each other. Semen, pus, and feces are everywhere, and everybody inevitablyretreats or teases open the gateway to the next freaky sub-conscioussub-basement. It's like a giant counter-culture ouroboros, except there's nothing seamless about this freaky self-devouring nightmare. In that sense, "Kuso" feels most important as a declaration of Ellison's arrival as a new voice in filmmaking. It definitely reads like a first film: full of promise, but oh so labored, andfussy. Ellison's music doesn't seem nearly so disjointed, and it appears that a change in media has resulted in some awkward first steps. Then again, maybe the best way to look at "Kuso" is a product of apparent creative labor that only really works when Ellison stops telling us what type of art he likes, and starts trying to do something with his pet influences. I can't wait to see his next film. Hopefully by that point he'llunclench, and justdo what comes naturally.
