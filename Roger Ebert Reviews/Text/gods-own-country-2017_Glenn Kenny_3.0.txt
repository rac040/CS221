Johnny Saxby, the protagonist of  Francis Lees impressive feature directorial debut, Gods Own Country, is a difficult character to like for quite a while. When first we see him, hes hunched over a toilet bowl, contending with the semi-dry-heaves that are familiar to alcoholics and younger fellows with delicate stomachs. Johnny may be one or the other, or both. In any event, puking is not a good look for him, particularly in cold rural morning light. Once in repose, or something like it, Johnny initially theres no way of getting around this brings to mind the phrase I think I first heard in a Monty Python sketch, that is spotty-faced git.   Johnny is the scion of a small farming family in Britains Pennine Mountains, a Northern region of England. When I say small farming family, I mean it: he is the only son of Deidre and Martin, two older folks who look as if rural existence has beaten the life out of them. Father Martin is in fact disabled, hobbled after a stroke. This leaves Johnny to look after the livestock, and the looking after of the livestock is portrayed in vivid detail. If you are made squeamish by Explicit Calving Action, and the aftermath thereof, this might not be a movie for you.     Aside from carrying the weight of the farm on his shoulders which he does poorly Johnny has another issue. Hes gay, which one infers does not go down well either with his immediate family or the extremely lumpen residents of the tiny town where Johnny goes for his drink. Johnnys world is shaken up a bit when Gheorghe, a Romanian immigrant with extensive experience and competence in tasks Johnny seems entirely indifferent to, arrives to temp at the farm. Gheorghe is handsome, confident, friendly. All of which annoys both Johnny and Martin no end at first.     Once Gheorghe and Johnny get to work at an area of the farm far removed from the main house, their seeming hostility to each other gives way to something else. Once theyve made love in the mud, they begin to bond. An unusual kind of Eden conjures itself up. The animals start to thrive or at least do better under Gheorghes tender, knowing ministrations, and Johnny himself opens up. He not only starts smiling more, he actually gets better-looking.     Gods Own Country is a tricky movie, but not in a way thats dishonest. Its first feet are in the school of miserablist realism, and while director Lee never abandons his things-as-they-are approach, he tells a love story by letting magic in at unusual angles. Most of which involve, yes, Gods own country, a ravishing landscape captured beautifully by the cinematography of Joshua  James Williams. The land can be contended with, inhabited, but it cant ever be tamed, is what the images tell us.        So too it is with life itself. After Johnnys father suffers another stroke, Johnny and Gheorghe have to face the question: do they have the conviction to try and make their situation, both personal and professional, permanent? Homophobia is not the only potential issue here. When Johnny take Gheorghe to his local pub, Gheorghe is disrespected by a xenophobic older townie. The what will Mom think issue is actually resolved in a way thats surprising and moving, as is so much in the movie.     Gods Own Country asks a lot of its actors, physically and emotionally, and they come through. Josh OConnor navigates Johnnys soddenness and transformation with exceptional sensitivity. As Gheorghe,  Alec Secareanu brings matinee-idol looks, easy charm, and palpable thoughtfulness to bear.  Gemma Jones and  Ian Hart play Johnnys parents, and despite a two-decade age gap between the actors, they are perfectly matched and in a sense, unrecognizable' they could very well be rural folks discovered by the director.     The movies denouement was ever so slightly sentimental for my tastes, but overall this is a pretty exceptional find' a solid story about how committing to what you believe in requires finding out what you believe in first. Sounds simple, but its not.
