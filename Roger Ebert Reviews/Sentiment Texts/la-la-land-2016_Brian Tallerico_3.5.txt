Musicals made me a romantic.
  Positive
They taught me that some emotion is so powerful that it cant be put into mere words it must be sung.
  Positive
Some love is so overwhelming that you just have to move your feet.
  Negative
With a family that loved classic films, I remember being awed by  Gene Kelly and  Fred Astaire, thinking they were as cool as anyone in movie history.
  Negative
Characters in musicals not only understood love differently than those in traditional films but they turned that understanding into art dancing, singing and transcending mere dialogue to become something greater, something purer, something closer to true romance.
  Positive
Weve had some musicals since the era of Rogers amp' Astaire, but few that have tried to recapture that sense of fluid, magical thinking in which characters communicate with their bodies as much, maybe even more, than they do with their voices.
  Negative
One of many remarkable things about  Damien Chazelles La La Land is how much energy and time it devotes to movement and music, not just lyrics.
  Positive
The modern movie musicals, so often based on Broadway shows, have focused heavily on songs that further plot.
  Positive
In Chazelles vision, choreography matters and a simple piano refrain can have more power than a lyric.
  Positive
This is a beautiful film about love and dreams, and how the two impact each other.
  Very positive
Los Angeles is filled with dreamers, and sometimes it takes a partner to make your dream come true.
  Positive
La La Land opens with a bit of a fake-out in that its a large ensemble number of a variety that we wont really see again in the movie.
  Positive
Cars are stuck in the notoriously awful L.A. traffic when the drivers decide to break into song called Another Day of Sun a bit about how each day brings new hope for these young wannabe artists jumping out of the cars and dancing on the freeway.
  Negative
Instantly, Chazelles direction and the dance choreography feels different.
  Positive
Here, and throughout the film, he works in long, unbroken takes.
  Neutral
You can not only see the dance moves, but you can see the dancers entire body when he or she performs them.
  Neutral
And after the chorus-like introduction to a city of dreamers, we meet two such sun-gazers: pianist Sebastian  Ryan Gosling and actress Mia  Emma Stone.
  Negative
Like any good musical, the two have a few false starts and playfully mock each others flaws in their first scenes.
  Negative
But we know where this is headed and Gosling amp' Stone have the chemistry to make us long for them to get together.
  Negative
The first major centerpiece scene is a long walk between Sebastian and Mia as the sun is setting over the Hollywood Hills.
  Negative
They start to see similarities in one another.
  Neutral
Mia is tired of going on worthless auditions, ones in which the producer doesnt even look up from their phone.
  Negative
Sebastian holds on to an ideal version of jazz, wanting to open his own club instead of selling out and playing greatest hits for tourists.
  Positive
And Sebastian and Mia have a clear, instant attraction.
  Positive
So, even as they sing about how theyre not really a couple, and how this gorgeous night is wasted because theyre not with their true partners, their bodies tell another story with a fantastically choreographed dance number.
  Negative
Stone and Gosling arent natural singers or dancers, but they bring so much character and commitment to every movement that it doesnt matter.
  Neutral
Theyre fluid, engaged and mesmerizing.
  Positive
We watch them fall in love through dance.
  Negative
Of course, it helps that Gosling and Stone have the kind of star power that made so many of those classic era musicals memorable.
  Positive
Hes smooth and charismatic' shes clever and beautiful.
  Positive
The phrase has lost most of its meaning, but these are movie stars.
  Negative
And, of course, theyre more than capable when La La Land demands greater depth, finding characters so rich that the movie would work without the music.
  Positive
Its a story of artistic passion, and how easy it is to get derailed from your dream.
  Positive
Sometimes it takes another person to push you back on to the tracks to find it again.
  Negative
Gosling and Stone get these characters, finding grace in their movement but emotional depth in their arcs' Stone has never been better.
  Positive
La La Land also exists as a very conscious ode to the allure of classic Hollywood.
  Positive
The pair goes to see  Rebel Without a Cause ending in one of the most magical scenes in years and films like  Casablanca and Bringing Up Baby are name-dropped.
  Negative
We have seen dozens of films that try to capture the allure of Hollywood, often with the cynical viewpoint that it will chew you up and spit you out, but Chazelles vision feels unique.
  Positive
It pays homage to musicals like Singin in the Rain and Jacques Demy's  The Umbrellas of Cherbourg without every directly mimicking them.
  Negative
Its easy to let the world get you down sometimes, especially in a year like this one.
  Positive
Its easy to think that dreams dont come true, and that love only exists in movies.
  Positive
La La Land serves to remind us that movies can still be magical, and they can still provide the channel for us to see magic in the world around us.
  Very positive
Its not so much another day in the sun, as the characters sing in that opening number, but the dreams of the night before, the ones we wake up and try to fulfill, that keep us dancing.This review was originally published on September ,  as a part of our TIFF coverage.
