Henrietta Lacks is one of those people who greatly impacted your life and you dont even know her name.

Whats even more fascinating about her story is that she didnt even know how much good she would do in the world after she died.
  Negative
In , after having five children, Lacks discovered that she had cervical cancer, from which she would pass away at a tragically young age of .
  Negative
Without the knowledge of Henrietta or her family, tissue from the tumor that killed her was taken from her body and essentially made immortal at Johns Hopkins.
  Negative
For decades, scientists there had been trying to grow a cell line on which the medical industry could experiment in ways that they couldnt do with living people.
  Neutral
Henrietta Lacks was the key that unlocked the door, leading to decades of medical advancements, including developments in the treatment of polio, Parkinsons, influenza, leukemia, and many more.
  Negative
With the cells named HeLa, most of the world had no idea that it was the biological property of a Virginia mother who changed the world.
  Negative
George C. Wolfes The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, premiering on HBO tomorrow night, tells Henriettas Renee Elise Goldsberry story.
  Negative
Sorta.
  Neutral
It also tells the story of journalist  Rebecca Skloot  Rose Byrne, the woman who spent a decade researching this strange story and wrote the bestselling book on which this film is based.
  Negative
Sorta.
  Neutral
It also tells the story of Deborah Lacks  Oprah Winfrey, Henriettas daughter, who has become somewhat obsessed and damaged by the saga of her mother and how little she feels like she knows about a woman who has somehow become the property of the world.
  Very negative
Any one of these stories could have worked on their own, but the awkward blending of all three doesnt work.
  Negative
Rebecca becomes little more than an unnecessary sounding board for Deborah, who could have anchored the story on her own.
  Negative
And, worst of all, it feels like we get to know the woman writing this tale more than the person its about.
  Very negative
At one point, someone says This story is crazy enough for three books!
  Negative
Which makes it both too much and not quite enough for one film.
  Negative
The Lacks family saga is an amazing one.
  Neutral
Not only did Henrietta grow up a young mother without much to her name, but her family tree developed fascinating subplots after her death.
  Positive
Deborahs obsession with her mother makes her the natural leading lady of this story, but we also meet the aggressive Zakariyya  Reg E. Cathey, a man hardened by a criminal lifestyle into which he might not have fallen if he knew more about his mother.
  Negative
The entire Lacks family becomes bitter and angry over a system that essentially took part of a mother they never really got to know, without anyones permission.
  Negative
They became downright paranoid about it, convinced both that John Hopkins had made millions to which they were owed and even that they might have cloned Henrietta.
  Negative
Courtney B. Vance appears as a slimy attorney who tries to take advantage of the Lacks family drama.
  Negative
If it sounds like a lot of movie for  minutes, youre not wrong.
  Negative
There is a socially relevant subtext here about how easy it was for the medical industry to take advantage of minorities, and often for little reason at all, other than they could.
  Positive
Would Henrietta Lacks have given her cells for research?
  Negative
Probably, but no one even asked.
  Negative
And John Hopkins would continue to deceive the Lacks family.
  Negative
Wolfe's movie seeks to humanize someone who became immortal.
  Neutral
It takes someone who became huge in the world of science and shows us who she was, the life she led, and the family she left behind.
  Negative
Then why isnt this her story?
  Neutral
We see flashbacks to Henrietta, but Wolfe and his team chose to make this the story of a daughter finding her mother instead, and it truly feels like we never really find Henrietta as viewers.
  Negative
Its about a woman who never knew her mother, and so it feels like something that was given to the rest of the world was stolen from her.
  Negative
Thats powerful drama, but the storytelling approach here diffuses it.
  Positive
Nothing feels invested in long enough to register because the narrative is constantly jumping around, almost as if its scared theres not enough story here to carry a film.
  Negative
Thank God for great casting.
  Positive
Winfrey is typically fantastic, finding the emotional undercurrent of a child who just wants to hold on to what she can when it comes to her mother.
  Positive
Cathey and Vance are spectacular in small roles.
  Positive
Only Byrne seems adrift, but thats a problem of direction and writing.
  Negative
Typically underrated, she is sometimes downright distracting here, giving an overdone performance designed to be the straight man to the oddity of Deborah.
  Negative
As great as it is that Rebecca helped bring this story into the light, her story is thin, and not only because it once again feels like were hearing the story of a minority family through the eyes of a white protagonist.
  Positive
Henrietta Lacks was a mortal.
  Negative
She was a sister and mother who died way too young, and did more for the world after she died than she ever could have imagined.
  Negative
The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks does its most good by bringing the full name back to HeLa.
  Neutral
With such a unique, decades-long story, perhaps its only appropriate that its going to take more than one movie before we really get to know her.
  Negative
