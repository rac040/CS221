The unlikely beauty of Charlie Brown is that no matter how many times he flails and fails, he keeps trying.
  Negative
Whether hes humiliated in front of his classmates, tangled up in kite string or knocked on his butt on the pitchers mound or football field, he gets back up, dusts himself off and gives it another go.
  Neutral
He isnt content to let the blockhead nickname define him.
  Negative
He consistently strives to improve to surprise us all and even himself.
  Positive
As antithetical as it may seem to his insecure, underdog persona, Charlie Brown is actually a pretty ballsy dude.
  Positive
The Peanuts Movie, by contrast, is all about playing it safe.
  Negative
Its all about repackagingand regurgitatingwhat weve already seen and what we already know.
  Neutral
It takes ideas, images, plot points and even verbatim bits of dialogue from previous Peanuts incarnations and projects them onto the big screen for a new generation without breathing much new life into them.
  Positive
Its disappointing and actually kind of cynical in its unwillingness to try anything even vaguely innovative with these beloved characters.
  Neutral
Not that the world needs a post-modern version of the late Peanuts creator  Charles M. Schulzs decades-old vision.
  Negative
The film from director  Steve Martino  Ice Age: Continental Drift written by Schulzs son, Craig, and grandson, Bryan, along with  Cornelius Uliano stays true to the timeless innocence and warm-hearted humor of the later comic strips and enduring television specials.
  Very positive
Theres nary a smidgen of snark to be found, which is refreshing in its own way.
  Negative
Telephones still have cords, Snoopy still pounds away on a manual typewriter and the few adults who exist are never seen but merely heard in a garbled wah-wah.
  Negative
Soulful Schroeder still plays a toy piano, sassy Lucy still doles out psychiatric advice from her sidewalk stand for just a nickel, loyal Marcie still calls bossy Peppermint Patty Sir and all the kids G-rated adventures seem that much more delightful with Vince Guaraldis jazzy score as a backdrop.
  Very positive
Despite the forward-thinking technological choice of using -D animation, The Peanuts Movie hews closely to the cheerful color palette and simple stylistic touches of Schulzs aesthetic.
  Positive
And all the characters you know and love are voiced by actual child actors, which gives it an immersive authenticity.
  Positive
Its all completely charming until you realize very quickly that there isnt much going on here besides a wallow in nostalgia with little narrative drive.
  Neutral
It brings me no joy to report this to you, I should add.
  Positive
I was a huge fan of all things Peanuts as a little girl I even had Snoopy and Woodstock sheets on my twin bed and Im now the mother of a six-year-old boy who regularly pops classic TV specials like Its the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown and A Charlie Brown Christmas into the DVD player.
  Negative
I even did that thing where you can create a Peanuts character version of yourself online.
  Negative
I am the target audience.
  Neutral
I was all in.
  Neutral
But even my son realized that The Peanuts Movie is sweet, gentle and not much more.
  Positive
He also knew immediately when he heard Peppermint Patty say to Charlie Brown: Youre holding my hand, Chuck.
  Negative
You sly dog, that the line had been lifted straight from A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving.
  Positive
The film essentially consists of a series of vignettes tied together by a couple of intertwined through-lines: Charlie Brown voiced pretty darn perfectly by  Noah Schnapp tries to work up the nerve to talk to the mythological Little Red-Haired Girl  Francesca Capaldi while his trusty beagle, Snoopy in his rich fantasy world as the World War I Flying Ace tries to woo a comely female pilot named Fifi  Kristin Chenoweth while also battling his nemesis, the Red Baron.
  Negative
Simply describing the plot makes it sound like its too much, but its simultaneously not enough.
  Negative
After a lively opening sequence in which the kids realize its a snow day and bound joyously out of their homes and onto the ice, the pacing settles into a lull from which it never even tries to emerge.
  Positive
Time and time again, these characters and all the others do exactly what you expect they will do no more, no less.Lucy  Hadley Belle Miller pulls the football away, just as Charlie Brown is about to kick it.Linus  Alexander Garfin says something quietly insightful while clutching his blue blanket.
  Negative
Sally  Mariel Sheets lovingly refers to Linus as her sweet baboo.
  Negative
And Snoopy swoops in and steals the show, every time.
  Positive
Its all harmless and reassuring, and a totally suitable first film choice for the smallest kids in your home.
  Positive
It wont ruin their childhood or memories of your own.
  Negative
But it could have been great.
