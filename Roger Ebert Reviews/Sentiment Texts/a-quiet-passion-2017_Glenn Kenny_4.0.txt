Terence Davies is ever a filmmaker in search of lost time.
  Negative
I do not believe he has ever made a feature film that is set in the present day, unless you count his  documentary on his beloved hometown of Liverpool,  Of Time and the City, a present day from which he mourned the past.
  Negative
This is not to say that Davies is any kind of nostalgia monger.
  Negative
In gazing at the past, he casts a cold eye on the oppression suffered by his characters, particularly his female ones.
  Negative
See his staggering  adaptation of  Edith Whartons  The House of Mirth, starring  Gillian Anderson, a near-surgical dissection of hypocrisy among the New York upper crust at the turn of the  th  century to the  th .
  Negative
Also his   The Deep Blue Sea, filmed from a  Terence Rattigan play, in which  Rachel Weiszs Hester is trapped in a loveless marriage in post-World War II Britain.
  Negative
A Quiet Passion, his latest film, goes back further in time than any of his past pictures, to the middle of the  th  century, and returns him to America, a place he has now visited three times in his filmography.
  Negative
His  film of John Kennedy Tooles novel The Neon Bible was set in s Georgia.
  Negative
Working from his own original screenplay, A Quiet Passion treats the life and the work of the poet Emily Dickinson, whose vast body of work was mostly unpublished in her lifetime.
  Negative
The movie begins with young Emily played by  Emma Bell keeping still in the middle of a chairless schoolroom as her fellow students move to the left or to the right, following the instructive questioning of a teacher who asks in just what way they desire to come to God and be saved.
  Negative
Standing in the middle of the room Emily tells her teacher, I am not even awakened yet.
  Negative
Therefore, she asks, How may I repent?
  Negative
We learn a little about how Emily acquired such seeming impudence.
  Negative
Her father, Edward, portrayed with solemnity and an unavoidable touch of wryness by  Keith Carradine, is a lawyer with liberal proclivities and possessed of some religious skepticism, not exactly an au courant view in Amherst polite society.
  Negative
That said, he is also quite conventional in his views of women and their place, albeit surprisingly indulgent of his children at times.
  Negative
At supper with the now-adult Emily, played by  Cynthia Nixon, he complains of a plate being dirty.
  Negative
Nonplussed, Emily picks up the plate and drops it to the floor, letting it shatter.
  Negative
She tells dad it is not dirty anymore.
  Neutral
He actually seems amused.
  Positive
The days of Amherst go by uneventfully enough at first.
  Negative
Emily whiles away the hours with her younger sister Vinnie  Jennifer Ehle and best friend Vryling Buffam  Catherine Bailey.
  Positive
They stroll through gardens and go to teas and trade quips.
  Negative
Emily publishes a scant poem or two in a local journal run by a friend of her fathers.
  Negative
There are suitors and marriages for others.
  Positive
Emily is too outspoken, too disinterested, too Emily to do anything but be herself.
  Negative
And to write, mostly in secret.
  Neutral
Davies does not view Dickinson as any kind of eccentric.
  Negative
Indeed, one feels that Davies strongly identifies with her.
  Negative
His dedication to his portrait is spectacularly evident in every shot of this very unusual movie.
  Positive
At first he presents his story and characters in the form of tableaus, like something out of a silent picture.
  Positive
The characters speak stiffly and stand as if posing.
  Neutral
As the movie continues, and certain events that came to define America and its character particularly the Civil War touch the lives of the Dickinsons, and we hear more of Emilys work in voiceover, the movies style becomes less constricted, more fluid, but still retains an unearthly quality.
  Positive
Just as Dickinsons poetic mode of personal expression and ear for idiosyncratic metaphor anticipated modernism, so here does Davies cinematic style slip certain bonds and achieve an unquiet fluidity.
  Positive
The effect is remarkable.
  Very positive
And it is grounded, and made most exemplary, by Cynthia Nixons performance.
  Positive
Every actor in this movie is wonderful.
  Very positive
But Nixons precision in portraying every particular mood of Emily for each individual scene calls for absolute specificity is simply spectacular.
  Negative
There are points in Emilys life when she is racked by illness, or possessed by a seeming madness.
  Negative
Her fury at the misbehavior of a family member in one scene late in the film, as she rails against a perceived lack of integrity, is chilling because Nixon makes the viewer see the extent to which Emily is actually turning that rage back upon herself.
  Positive
Every scene in the movie contains a performance revelation of almost equal power.
  Positive
I will be very surprised if I see a better performance from an American actor this year.
  Positive
A Quiet Passion is not suffused with the romantic ache or agony of some of Davies other films.
  Negative
It does not mourn for what Emily Dickinson did not have.
  Negative
Rather it admires her for what she was, and what literary posterity made of her.
  Negative
And it invites the viewer to take seriously her mode of thought and of art' not just to take seriously, but to revel, inasmuch as one is able to revel in work that is simultaneously so austere and so rich.
  Positive
Like the movie itself.
  Neutral
