Such is the stuff of The Maze Runner, which hews pretty closely to the YA-novel formula thats reliably produced so many hugely successful film adaptations in recent years.
  Positive
And, indeed, director  Wes Balls film is based on the best seller by  James Dashner.
  Negative
It features a similar structure, hits some recognizable beats and includes some character types that will seem pretty familiar to anyone whos seen the Hunger Games films, or Divergent, or The Giver.
  Positive
But its roots stretch back further to classic, allegorical literature about frightening utopias, especially Lord of the Flies.
  Negative
While theres no Piggy and no conch, the teenage boys who populate this eerily idyllic society have formed their own leadership and their own rules, and they think theyve achieved a peaceful sense of order.

Actually, he doesnt even know his name is Thomas at first.
  Negative
Dylan OBrien MTVs Teen Wolf, who resembles a young  Rob Lowe, plays the confused young man.

The films sound design is quite startling and effective' it puts you on edge from the earliest moments.

  Negative
Dozens of handsome, young men of various ethnicities wearing various shades of the same long-sleeved shirt work together cooperatively in the sunshinebuilding huts, gardening, cooking, etc.
  Negative
Its like the worlds hottest, grungiest Benetton ad.
  Negative
Like the others before him, Thomas has no memory of who he is and no idea how he got there.
  Negative
But as the newest arrival to the Glade, he is dubbed a greenie and duly hazed until he can prove his worth to the key figures he meets.
  Negative
The charismatic Alby  Aml Ameen, who was the first to arrive, is the de facto leader.

And Minho  Ki Hong Lee is the head of the runners: fleet-footed boys who dare to enter an opening in the giant walls and explore the maze that lies behind them.
  Negative
Its vast and treacherous but at least navigable in the daytime' at night, it closes up, changes paths and devours anyone foolish enough to remain trapped.
  Negative
No one has survived it overnight and no one has exited the other side.
  Negative
Naturally, Thomas is intrigued.
  Negative
And whats intriguing about The Maze Runnerfor a long time, at leastis the way it tells us a story we think weve heard countless times before but with a refreshingly different tone and degree of detail.
  Positive
Ball, whose background is in visual effects, doesnt overload his feature debut with a lot of glossy, high-tech imagery.
  Negative
Not for a while, anyway.
  Neutral
Much of the films charm comes from its rough-hewn aesthetica tactile nature thats both industrial and organicand the way it takes its time vividly establishing an environment.
  Positive
When Thomas eventually does enter the mazeno spoiler there, folks, its in the titleit produces some moments that are truly harrowing and filled with non-stop, near-death peril.

What a misstep.
  Neutral
Its so incredibly frustrating, because everything was going so well until then.
  Negative
The third act brings some mystery with the arrival of the first girl ever sent up in the elevator: a strong-willed brunette named Teresa Kaya Scodelario, who seems to know Thomas already.
  Negative
But The Big Reveal of what happened to these kids, who trapped them in this place and what their purpose is ends up being pretty over-the-top even for sci-fi.
  Negative
A lot happens in the films final minutes to the extent that it makes The Maze Runner feel like it has several conclusions.
  Negative
Some of them feature some unintentional hilarity when shock and fear probably were in the game plan.
  Neutral
And they squander the formidable and versatile  Patricia Clarkson in only a few moments as the chilly, nefarious mastermind of the maze.
  Negative
Presumably, shell figure more prominently in the sequel.
