Jonathan Levines The Night Before is another  Seth Rogen joint in which the talented comedianwriter faces adulthood, learning that friendship can survive the journey to maturity.
  Positive
Throughout the raucous, drug-fueled comedy, Rogens character and his best friends speak repeatedly of this being the last such bash.
  Negative
It made me wonder if Rogen wasnt heading off criticism of repetition in the past yes, weve thrown this party before in films like Knocked Up, This is the End and Neighbors but this is really the last time.
  Negative
Whether or not thats the case, The Night Before is a well-intentioned comedy with some big laughs and some big misfires, but it ultimately works because Rogen and his well-cast buddies ground it in a way that makes them likable.
  Positive
A killer  Michael Shannon supporting performance never hurts either.
  Negative
The Night Before opens with a literal Christmas tale storybook animation, narrated by  Tracy Morgan in a way only he can.
  Negative
We learn of three best friends Ethan  Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Isaac Seth Rogen and Chris  Anthony Mackie who have been spending Christmas Eve together for over a decade, since Ethan lost his parents, doing their best to have as much fun as possible acting mostly like idiots.
  Negative
Blowing up snowmen, getting high and going to look at the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree, singing Christmas in Hollis at karaoke theyll do whatever it takes to make this holiday more memorable than the last, recognizing that emotions run high at the holidays and trying to keep Ethan positive.
  Negative
The annual event is straining under the reality of adulthood.
  Negative
Isaac has a loving wife  Jillian Bell, who is well into her third trimester.
  Positive
Hes about to be a father for the first time there can be no more holiday debauchery.
  Negative
Chris is dealing with a different issue altogether, having a breakthrough season on the football field, although hes been using steroids to do so, recognizing that a -year-old athlete is past his prime.
  Negative
He also seems more concerned with his social media following than his real life.
  Negative
Meanwhile, Ethan is recently split from Diana  Lizzy Caplan, a girl who finally showed him the door after he kept refusing to meet her parents.
  Negative
He not-so-secretly wants her back.
  Positive
Two events define the trajectory of The Night Before Ethan stumbles upon tickets to a legendary NYC holiday party known as The Nutcracker Ball, while Isaacs wife gives him a box of drugs to enhance the evenings insanity.
  Negative
As the boys pre-game for the big party to come later that night, Isaac gets deeply messed up, allowing Rogen to display some truly bad behavior as he mixes mushrooms, Molly, coke, weed and more from his box of goodies.
  Negative
Meanwhile, Chris tries to buy some pot to impress the star quarterback on his team, leading the gang to Mr. Green Michael Shannon, the same dealer they bought from back in high school.
  Negative
Comedy Central stars Ilana Glazer Broad City and Nathan Fielder Nathan For You pop up in cameos, and Miley Cyrus appears late in the piece in a very funny scene to remind us all that Wrecking Ball is a perfect pop song.
  Negative
Several of the bits within The Night Before fall surprisingly flat.
  Negative
Mindy Kaling is wasted as Dianas best friend, and a scene in which Isaacs nose drips cocaine blood into her drink is horribly unfunny.
  Very negative
Another scene late in the piece in which Ethan picks a fight with a couple of drunk guys dressed as Santa Claus also simply doesnt work.
  Positive
One wonders if the piece didnt need another rewrite, or if Levine, who has shown solid dramatic chops with  , was the right fit for this kind of wacky adventure.
  Positive
He doesnt always nail the comedic balance, especially as the piece gets deeper in its characterizations and were still supposed to believe these guys are dumb enough to try and steal a horse-drawn carriage another disastrously unfunny bit.
  Positive
If youre keeping a ledger, and some of you probably are, The Night Before has more scenes that simply dont work compared to This is the End or Neighbors.
  Negative
However, and this is a big however, it has a great cast.
  Neutral
Gordon-Levitt and Mackie bring gravity to their roles that would otherwise be missing with lesser, pure comedy actors in the roles.
  Negative
Caplan and Gordon-Levitt have honest chemistry, and Levine seems more invested in their arc than most directors would be.
  Positive
We want to see these characters happy, and that matters more than you might think.
  Positive
They're not merely joke mouthpieces like in a Happy Madison flick.
  Negative
They're real people played by excellent actors.
  Positive
Their narrative quest for comfort under the Christmas tree doesnt feel like the clich that it otherwise would because Levine and his trio of actors invest in it completely.
  Negative
And Michael Shannon steals every scene hes in as the wisest pot dealer in the Big Apple.
  Negative
The Night Before has enough bad jokes to at times make you wonder if Rogen shouldnt have matured out of this subgenre one movie earlier.
  Negative
However, it ends strong.
  Neutral
The last half-hour is the best in the film, as weve come to know and like these characters, and the writers are done wasting time to get to the big jokes and emotional realizations weve all been waiting for.
  Positive
In the end, its not the lowlights of those crazy nights of our life that we remember, and The Night Before has enough highlights to make it a fitting final holiday bash.
  Negative
