I remember the first record I ever owned.
  Positive
It was probably around , and Id just come out of a showing of Cooley High at the Pix Theater in Jersey Citys McGinley Square.
  Negative
Enamored by the Motown score on  Michael Schultzs movie, I convinced my aunt to buy me a copy of The Four Tops Reach Out Ill Be There at a nearby record store.
  Negative
We went in, and as my aunt thumbed through the soul singles rack, I had a sudden change of heart.
  Negative
That change was brought on by the record that was playing in the store.
  Positive
I just had to have that song as well, but the agreement wasone, not two.
  Negative
I can still see the guy taking the record off the record player, slipping it into a static-filled paper sleeve before selling it to me.
  Positive
I can also still see my aunts facepalm as she realized Id given up a Holland-Dozier-Holland classic for Chuck Berrys My Ding-a-Ling.
  Negative
Anybody who has ever spent time in a record store has memories like this.
  Positive
I can close my eyes and walk through that store as if Id been there yesterday, and after Im done, I can mentally stroll through the layout of Tower Records on West  th Street in New York City.
  Negative
It was a place where Id spent far too much money and time, neither of which I regret.
  Negative
It was a heaven filled with vinyl, easily popped cassette tapes and, eventually, the CDs that unwittingly signaled the downfall of the neighborhood record store.

Started in  in Sacramento,  Russ Solomons business venture began small, then enjoys a period of success buffered by unbelievable decadence and an adolescent brand of fearlessness and perceived invincibility.
  Negative
And just like in life, the piper of harsh adulthood materialized to collect payment on the tune that was never supposed to stop playing.
  Negative
An onscreen title at the beginning of All Things Must Pass informs us that, in , Tower Records was a billion dollar company.
  Negative
Five years later, it was bankrupt, the next title tells us, preparing us for the bitter end of the party to which Hanks invites us.
  Negative
We then meet Solomon, whose dad owned Tower Drugs, a store inside Sacramentos Tower movie theater.
  Negative
To make money, Solomon decided to sell used records from the jukebox, and when that proved successful, he started selling new records.
  Negative
Solomons dad, Clayton, wanted no part of this, so he sold the business and the extra space to his son.

Tower Records was born, and since there was nothing else to do in the neighborhood, teenagers flocked to it.
  Negative
Solomon considered his Tower Records employees to be family, and that feeling plays out with the numerous talking heads who populate All Things Must Pass."
  Negative
People like Steve Gorman,  Mark Viducich and the delightfully salty  Heidi Cotler discuss their decades long affiliation with the store, starting from their early days as a store clerk to their last days as upper management.

Solomon explains that every higher-up started out working in the store.
  Neutral
He called his managerial style the Tom Sawyer method of management.

Once installed there, and in Los Angeles, the celebrities started to come out to visit the store, looking for other artists records while gauging how their own work was doing.

  Positive
Tower Records expands to Japan and, much later, into the famous NYC Village location.
  Negative
The old New York I knew and loved gets a visual shout-out when we see just how decrepit the area of West  th and Broadway was when Solomon bought property there.
  Positive
The store, which was a major hit, revitalized the area and brought its own share of local celebrities, college students and music lovers into its multi-storied interior.
  Positive
While All Things Must Pass unflinchingly details the companys downfall, due in part to record company greed, bad financial decisions and the rise of Napster, theres a world-weary, lessons-learned stoicism that feels so intimately personal.
  Negative
It makes the happiest scenes in the stores stick with us most memorably.
  Positive
Everybody in a record store is your friend for  minutes,says  Bruce Springsteen, whose early days were spent at the California-based Tower Records locations.

This is the feeling All Things Must Pass instilled in me as I watched it.
  Negative
I imagine millennials will hold up digital music players and roll their eyes at us old people weeping in the audience.
  Positive
All Things Must Pass will play as an entertaining history lesson for the current generation.
  Positive
But any movie that begins and ends with the sound of a phonograph needle hitting vinyl knows the audience sweet spot its aiming for, and for those folks, All Things Must Pass is a rousing success.
  Positive
