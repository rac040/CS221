A numbing and soulless spectacle of -D, computer-generated imagery run amok,  Ridley Scotts Exodus: Gods and Kings presents an enduring tale by pummeling us over the head with it.
  Negative
The story of Moses rising up against the Pharaoh Ramses and leading hundreds of thousands of Hebrew slaves out of Egypt to freedom is one with which were all extremely familiar.
  Negative
Its the entire point of Passover.
  Neutral
Scott is not reinventing the wheel here.
  Negative
Rather, hes invented the biggest, shiniest, noisiest wheel imaginable, then he runs over us with it rather than inviting us along for the ride.
  Negative
Certainly, theres an allure to seeing this sort of old-fashioned, biblical epic on the big screenand indeed, within this proliferation of pixels, there is undeniable craft and heft to the massive set pieces and behemoth battles.
  Positive
From the costumes to the weaponry to the interiors, its obvious that Scotts team took great care in considering and creating every detail.
  Negative
But the film as a whole with a script credited to  Adam Cooper amp'  Bill Collage and  Jeffrey Caine and  Steven Zaillian feels overstuffed and over-glossed.
  Negative
Self-serious to a fault, it packs in more and more in terms of story and extravagant visuals while offering too little in terms of actual character development and engaging drama.
  Negative
When hes been at his absolute best in hislengthycareer, directing films like  Blade Runner and  Alienand even "Thelma amp' Louise,"Scott has established himself as a visionary and a master of creating imagery that would go on to be iconic.
  Positive
Exodus feels oddly impersonal.
  Negative
Its hard to tell what Scotts point is here, beyond making his Academy Award-winning  Gladiator look like an independent film by comparison.
  Negative
Earlier this year, Gladiator star  Russell Crowe played the title character in  Darren Aronofskys  Noah.
  Negative
That was a biblical epic which also was massive in scope but at the same time beautiful and strange' it stayed true to its source material but found an intriguing and challenging tone.
  Positive
It actually evoked emotion.
  Neutral
In Exodus, the plagues are fun, briefly, and thats about it.
  Positive
At least, the prospect of the plagues presents the promise of fun: Eww, gross, a massive pile of frogs, or: Aww, yeah, here come the locusts.
  Negative
But like so much else in the film, these potentially thrilling sequences of havoc and terror evolve into enormous swarmsdigitallydivorced from their effect on humanity.
  Negative
The boils, thoughthey remain.
  Negative
And theyre nasty.
  Negative
It certainly doesnt help that  Christian Bale plays Moses in mostly stiff and detached fashion.
  Neutral
But hey, at least hes more intelligible here than he is as a grumbling and tormented Batman.
  Negative
Here, hes a quietly capable leader a general among men, and in the eyes of the Pharaoh Seti  John Turturro, who raised Moses ashis adoptedson, clearly more capable to take over the kingdom than his own biological son, the preening and egotistical Ramses  Joel Edgerton.
  Negative
Despite the thick eyeliner, the shiny, bald pate and the radiant golden wardrobe, Edgerton is never quite flamboyant enough.
  Negative
He could have gone over the top with the role and helped breathe some life into this picture.
  Positive
He seems sadly uncomfortable.
  Negative
Once its revealed that Moses is actually, you know, Jewish, hes cast into exile, where he forges a pleasant, new life for himself as a sheepherder with a wife and a son.
  Positive
Meanwhile, over the past nine years, Ramses has assumed power and essentially turned Memphis into Las Vegas: overbuilt, overpopulated and so generally overwhelmed that slaves are being burned to death just to thin the place out.
  Negative
It seems entirely possible that Scott does not get the irony of constructing something that is simply too big.
  Negative
Its at this time that Moses starts seeing visions and receiving instructions as to his true purpose: to return to his homeland and free his people.
  Negative
God appears to him as an impish British schoolboy, which is a rather clever idea.
  Neutral
In retrospect, Old Testament God does seem rather capricious and destructive in ways that remind me of myovertired-year-old son playing with his Legosafter a long day at school.
  Negative
But that casting represents a rare moment of innovation in a film that may as well come with a checklist at the door.
  Positive
Even the parting of the Red Seawhich should be a spectacular event generating legitimate excitementsuggests the draining of a massive bathtub.
  Positive
Ben Kingsley appears in a woefully small role as Nun, the elderly scholar who shares the news with Moses about histrueheritage, yet he cant help but infuse his few moments with great dignity.
  Positive
As Joshua, who helps Moses lead the slaves out of Egypt,  Aaron Paul is mostly relegated to sticking by Moses side, a huge waste of both his presence and his ordinarily inspired instincts.
  Negative
Sigourney Weaver gets even less to do as Ramses haughty mother, Tuya, while  Hiam Abbass, as Moses mother, Bithia, has only a handful of lines of dialogue.
  Negative
So why is this blockbuster different from all other blockbusters?
  Negative
Its not.
  Neutral
Theres just more of it.
  Neutral
And less.
