Good one, and What We Did On Our Holiday, written and directed by  Andy Hamilton and  Guy Jenkin, is replete with zingers, a quality not to be disdained in a family comedy of miscommunication.

The movie is inspired by the BBC sitcom Outnumbered, also a Hamilton and Jenkin effort, in which two parents were pitted against three children and a lot of the dialogue was improvised in a kids say the darnedest things spirit.
  Negative
Holiday does a good job of making the young characters look terrifically spontaneous, and the adult cast is rife with expertise: Pike is both frazzled and dry, while Tennant proves that his wide-eyed intensity works as well as a comic tic as it does when hes playing an existentially tortured bloke in more serious fare.

While Hamilton and Jenkin provide a lot of gentle moments of poignancy, and the cinematography of the Scottish countryside shot by Martin Hawkins goes a long way in selling the movies the-simple-pleasures-of-life-are-best philosophy, Holiday wisely sticks to its frantic-but-not-grotesque-farce guns throughout its tidy  minutes.

It wears not just its Britishness but its relative good taste on its sleeve: unlike its U.S. counterparts, theres nary a poop or fart joke in evidence in this domestic comedy.
  Negative
Its not what youd call major cinema, but its a breezy entertainment, particularly if youre a fan of one or more of the cast members.
