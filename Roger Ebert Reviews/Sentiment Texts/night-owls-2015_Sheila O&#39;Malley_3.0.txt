"Night Owls" has a very obvious set-up, established in the first  minutes of the film: .
  Neutral
Two wasted people, Kevin  Adam Pally and Madeline  Rosa Salazar, meet in a bar and stumble to her house to have drunken sex.
  Negative
.
  Neutral
The morning after, Kevin finds out, horrified, that the house is not Madeline's house at all, but the house of his boss and mentor, a revered and very married football coach at the local college.
  Negative
Kevin realizes that he has inadvertently broken into his boss' house and had sex in his boss' marital bed.
  Negative
.
  Neutral
Meanwhile, upstairs, Madeline swallows a bottle of pills and nearly overdoses.
  Negative
.
  Neutral
Kevin, in a panic, calls the Assistant Coach who orders Kevin not to call  to avoid scandal for the football program and tells Kevin not to the let the girl who has supposedly been stalking the coach and threatening to go to the press about the affair leave until Assistant Coach can get there by morning to do some damage control.
  Negative
.
  Neutral
Kevin obeys.
  Neutral
Hence: he and Madeline must spend the next  hours in that house.
  Negative
hours follow, in which the two fight like cats and dogs, play darts, eat food, fight again, but maybe also ... start to like each other.
  Negative
That's a lot of artifice and coincidence.
  Neutral
However, director  Charles Hood who co-wrote the script with  Seth Goldsmith has such a gift for capturing the rhythms of conversation as well as slapstick elements of which "Night Owls" has many that it doesn't matter.
  Neutral
The film has more in common with s screwball films filled with obvious coincidences than the more clunky, often-humorless films that pass for "rom-coms" today.
  Negative
When Kevin wakes up after sex and can't find her, he walks through the house, calling out, tentatively, "Lady?
  Negative
Hey, Lady!"
  Neutral
He sounds polite and gentlemanly even though it reveals he doesn't know her name.
  Negative
Once he discovers her suicide attempt, he makes her vomit, almost vomiting himself in the process, and then drags her into the shower.
  Negative
When she starts to pass out against the tiled wall, he panics, and starts scooping water out of the flow coming from the showerhead, tossing it on her, a gesture both desperate and feeble.
  Negative
This was the moment when the movie "got" me.
  Neutral
It's a bit of well-played physical business that comes out of the crisis of the moment, and it works because he looks truly distressed.
  Positive
Slapstick comedy is practically a lost art.
  Negative
It's sad, because there's such anarchic pleasure in watching, say,  Cary Grant and  Katharine Hepburn plunge into the deep river in "Bringing Up Baby," Hepburn gasping as they swim to shore, "The riverbed's changed!"
  Negative
Or Hepburn capturing Grant in her butterfly net.
  Neutral
Or Grant setting his wet socks on fire.
  Neutral
Love is chaos, men and woman are separated by an abyss, and to get to one another they have to leap.
  Negative
But then they find the riverbed's changed and they're in over their heads.
  Negative
Screwballs feature cranky, nerdy men whose dignity is ripped away by wisecracking Dames of Mayhem, but somehow the nerds start to like it.
  Negative
"Night Owls" has this sensibility running underneath it, the script understands it, and Hood knows how to film it.
  Positive
Actors Adam Pally and Rosa Salazar, who carry the entire film, are not just game for this kind of material, they feel born to it.
  Negative
Their dynamic sparks all over the place.
  Positive
They don't just have romantic chemistry, they have that much rarer kind: the chemistry of conversation.
  Negative
Kevin is almost hurt that his idol is obviously a hypocrite who doesn't practice what he preaches.
  Negative
That sense intensifies over the course of the film, and Madeline is at first exasperated and then infuriated by it.
  Negative
Like Cary Grant in "Bringing Up Baby," Kevin is a workaholic nerd who has a hard time controlling this ditzy, intelligent dame, until finally, the question of control disappears.
  Negative
hours is a long time.
  Neutral
"Night Owls" has many funny moments, broad and subtle.
  Positive
There's a physical gag with a treadmill that is worth the price of admission.
  Positive
The dialogue is snappy and feels spontaneous.
  Positive
He tries to stop her from leaving, and she warns him repeatedly to back off before spraying mace in his eyes.
  Negative
She then feels bad, helping him wash out his eyes as he moans, "I'm going to have to wear two eyepatches to work."
  Negative
She, folding up a wet washcloth, snaps, "Nobody wears two eyepatches."
  Negative
And you know, she has a point.
  Positive
As someone who loves screwball its rat-a-tat dialogue, and the virtuosity required of the performers it is great to see it so alive and well.
  Positive
Screwball requires timing as steady as a metronome, a talented director who films in a way that doesn't let the rhythm dissipate, not to mention most importantly extremely talented actors.
  Positive
"Night Owls" has all of it.
  Positive
Praise must be given, too, to cinematographer  Adrian Correia and editor  Grant Surmi, who proceed with certainty and control.
  Negative
Comedy is hard and this team makes it look easy.
  Positive
Some of the transitions are clunky, with Kevin manufacturing a way to keep the conversation going.
  Negative
Those moments might work better onstage, theatre being more forgiving of artifice.
  Negative
"Night Owls" would make a great theatre production.
  Positive
But those are mere hiccups, the script ricocheting between heated arguments and bursts of humor.
  Neutral
Kevin and Madeline battle preconceived notions about one another and it's all complicated by the fact that they've already slept together, like, an hour ago.
  Positive
One-act plays often feature obvious set-ups: two wildly different personalities are forced to share space for whatever reason it doesn't matter, and at first they hate each other, and by the end they don't.
  Very negative
Acting teachers use obvious set-ups in their classes: "You're a millionaire, you're a short-order cook, you're trapped in an elevator.
  Very negative
Go."
  Neutral
Shakespeare's set-ups were often obvious with plots lifted from extant sources: put a bunch of court-folk into a magical forest for whatever reason it doesn't matter, boundaries dissolve, comedy ensues, love becomes possible.
  Negative
Suspicion towards the "obvious" seems a relatively recent phenomenon.
  Negative
People complain about convenient coincidences, obvious plots, etc.
  Neutral
Sometimes these criticisms are valid.
  Neutral
But sometimes, all you need is a really strong set-up, no matter how obvious, and then let the action swing into motion.
  Negative
Go with it.
  Positive
Take the leap.
  Neutral
The riverbed may have changed, but it's so much fun flailing your way to the other side.
  Negative
