MI- looks exactly like what it is: a movie derived from a TV show.
  Neutral
The show was called Spooks when it ran on the BBC for ten seasons, from -.
  Negative
In the U.S. it was known as MI-.
  Neutral
This reviewer never saw the show, but on the evidence of the movie, he feels he didnt miss much.
  Negative
Its relative longevity, though, indicates the series must have had a dedicated following, which is no doubt the prime audience for this theatrical elaboration.
  Negative
Others viewers may be less appreciative.
  Neutral
An action espionage tale vaguely in the Jason Bourne mold, "MI-" does indeed play like a TV spin-off, but one in which the filmmakers said to their team, Listen up, all!
  Negative
Were now doing the cinema version.
  Neutral
What can we do to make it cinematic?
  Neutral
The answers supplied by  Bharat Nalluri, one of the TV shows original directors, and his collaborators are pretty much what youd expect: super-widescreen format, lots of panoramic wide shots especially from helicopters, big action scenes, and a story capacious enough to encompass roles for a number of reputable character actors plus a lead part for one hot young TV-into-film star, Games of Thrones  Kit Harington who has been bruited as a potential replacement for  Daniel Craig as .
  Negative
The film kicks off with a rather stereotypical action set-piece that cuts between two main locations: stuck in traffic during a rain storm, a high-security van carrying an important American jihadi is attacked by gun-wielding motorcyclists, who free the prisoner and create mayhem before speeding off' back in the MI- subcommand center, agents and their superiors watch this attack via a bevy of security cameras but find themselves unable to thwart it.
  Negative
The man in charge, Sir Harry Pearce  Peter Firth, a veteran of the TV show, gives the order to release the prisoner in order to prevent a bloodbath among ambient civilians.
  Negative
Theres something, well, almost comically British about this opener.
  Positive
Can you imagine an American film in which a high-value prisoners captivity would be at risk due to a simple traffic jam?
  Neutral
And would the cream of the nations intelligence service be shown as so completely impotent and inept that they cant even get agents to the scene during the crime?
  Negative
Funny thing is, though this is not at all a satire or at least not obviously so, that very comparison seems to be on the filmmakers minds.
  Negative
The rescued jihadi is a CIA prisoner' the Brits are simply transporting him to their Yankee counterparts.
  Positive
We hear the CIA and the U.S. mentioned repeatedly during the scene, often in terms suggesting that the guys across the Atlantic are superiors rather than co-equals.
  Negative
The Americans will crucify us, frets one MI- officer.
  Negative
Its interesting to wonder why this is so.
  Positive
Is it to appeal to American viewers?
  Neutral
Or to intimate that Britains intelligence services really are second-rate?
  Neutral
Or could it be a correlative for the filmmakers sense that Hollywood is better at this kind of moviemaking than they are?
  Neutral
Whatever the reason, the remainder of the movie centers on two characters.
  Negative
After he flubs the jihadis escape, Harry Pearce becomes the spy who goes out into the cold, disappearing underground in an attempt to find out who in MI- betrayed his operation.
  Negative
And to try to locate him, the outfit recalls an agent from Moscow: Will Holloway Harington is a young hot-head whose relationship with Harry has the distrust and flux of a troubled father-son bond.
  Negative
Naturally, the specter of Islamic terrorism looms over much of the tale, and it produces a spectacular explosion at a West End theater where the NATO is having a gala, although here too theres a note of British underachievement: the blast seems to obliterate much of the full building, yet later we hear that only six people were killed.
  Negative
Besides the obligatory explosions, shootings and much talk about technology amp' terrorism, the film features lots of scenes of characters running down London streets, through busy public spaces like airport terminals and such.
  Negative
Somehow this feels more formulaic and repetitious than exciting, so its worth wondering how much Nalluris stylistic choices had to do with that.
  Negative
In the "Bourne" films, where such scenes usually are exciting, the directors especially  Paul Greengrass often favor telephoto lenses, which lets us see the characters expressions.
  Positive
Here, Nalluri generally employs wide-angle lenses, which makes the running seem faster but seldom allows views of the runners faces.
  Negative
That choice, of motion over emotion, can stand as a symbol of the differences between TV-style and more cinematic approaches to such material.
  Negative
In a cast that also includes Jennnifer Ehle,  David Harewood and  Lara Pulver, Peter Firth easily proves the standout.
  Positive
Hes the kind of British actor whose gravity and rumpled worry bring a welcome touch of John le Carr to a film that, like most of its ilk these days, is more interested in action than motivation.
  Neutral
As for his junior counterpart, Kit Harington does a credible movie-star turn as the long-haired rebel, but he strikes this reviewer as too youthful and unseasoned to be catapulted into the shoes of James Bond.
  Negative
