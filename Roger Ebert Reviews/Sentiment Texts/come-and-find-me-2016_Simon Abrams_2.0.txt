Pseudo-suspenseful romantic-drama "ComeandFindMe" does not work.
  Negative
That needs saying up front because the thing itself is not an unworkable premise, nor is its cast bad, nor its director inconsiderate, or its scenario dumb.
  Negative
In fact, the whole thing is altogether smarter than you might expect from a two-star-rated flick.
  Positive
Still, "ComeandFindMe" lacks sufficient inspiration and follow-through to be truly exciting.
  Negative
The raw ingredients are there: "Breaking Bad" actor  Aaron Paul plays a characteristically likable everyman who discovers his girlfriend is not who she appears to be after she goes missing for a year.
  Negative
But there's nothing to "ComeandFindMe" beyond a superficial investment in its central characters' romantic relationship.
  Negative
Paul plays David, a graphic designer who becomes obsessed with finding his girlfriend Claire  Annabelle Wallis after she suddenly disappears.
  Neutral
David doesn't have many clues to go on, though he does eventuallyfinda roll of undeveloped film that leadsseveral hostile interested parties to his door, including torture-happy Russian gangsters, and equally shady government agents.
  Neutral
Still, remember: this is a romance first, and then a thriller.
  Positive
So "ComeandFindMe" mainly concerns David's memories of Claire.
  Positive
We see various episodes in their relationship, from when they first meet to their first serious fight.
  Positive
There are signs of Claire's double life ostentatiously hidden throughout these scenes, but there's no puzzle to solve here.
  Negative
Instead, writerdirector  Zack Whedon shows us Claire and Paul's relationship in order to establish David's fierce loyalty.
  Positive
That theme is crucial since David is constantly being betrayed by friendly strangers who claim to know Claire, or have information about her.
  Neutral
Much of Whedon's drama is comprised of flashbacks,but those flashbacks give meaning to David's easily-frustrated quest for answers.
  Negative
This is a bit of a problem since a constant series of interrupting flashbacks winds up stalling "ComeandFindMe," Whedon's directorial debut, whenever it starts to develop momentum.
  Negative
Whedon's flashback-heavy plot is also frustrating because Wallis and Paul don't seem to have any chemistry.
  Negative
This is partly a matter of poor direction, and partly just a sad lack of airborne sparks.
  Negative
Wallis and Paul are supposed to appear clumsy when they first lock lips because their relationship is initially defined by Claire's awkward, giddy energy.
  Negative
She thinks David is following her from the bus stop but he actually lives in the same building as her.
  Neutral
Likewise, when they kiss, she leads: she pounces on him, and pushes her face into his, like an eager high-schooler who has no idea what she's doing.
  Negative
But when the couple lock lips later in the film, she kisses him in the same exact way.
  Negative
It's not cute at that point, but rather confusing: why haven't these two actors learned how to express their love for each other?
  Negative
The short answer: Whedon has a lot of good ideas, but doesn't follow through on them.
  Neutral
He films Paul using fairly rudimentaryuninspired medium and long shots.
  Neutral
Whedon also doesn't explicitly spell out any truths about his characters' fears of intimacy during David's myriad flashbacks.
  Negative
We see David and Claire flirting when they paint their first apartment together, and wind up scribbling bathroom-stall-quality graffiti insults to each other all over their ceiling.
  Negative
We see them fight after she comes home in an inexplicable mood and he elects to sleep on the couch.
  Negative
And we see them try to spice up their love lives when they re-enact their first meeting.
  Positive
But none of these episodes show us anything about Clair and Davidbeyond a basic seasonal progression that perplexingly comes full-circle at film's end.
  Negative
I won't explicitly tell youwhat happens, but I will tell you that that the film's biggest problem is a matter of showing romantic love through cliches.
  Negative
A better dialogue-writer could have done wonders with scenes where she teases him.
  Negative
And a superior director might have been more patient, and focused on the furtive looks, twitchy limbs, and playful scowls that Paul and Wallis exchange.
  Positive
But Whedon is not that filmmaker.
  Negative
I wish he was because Paul delivers a finely-tuned broody performance, albeit one we've seen him deliver before in everything from indie drama " Smashed" to big-budget action-adventure " Need for Speed."
  Negative
Wallis doesn't have much of a role since she is supposed to be elusive, but she does well enough with what few lines she has.
  Positive
The main problem is Whedon's lack of creativity.
  Negative
His film's stop-and-go pace wouldn't be so bad if he nailed any one part of it.
  Negative
But Whedoneven manages to drop the ball when his film's in thriller mode: he delivers a handful of lackluster chase scenes and way too many slack, ostensibly confrontational conversations between David and, well, every two-faced "good guy" he can call on to help him.
  Negative
"ComeandFindMe" constantly threatens to goplaces that many contemporary thrillers never venture to, but ultimately runs out of gas and winds up taking the path of least imagination.
  Negative
