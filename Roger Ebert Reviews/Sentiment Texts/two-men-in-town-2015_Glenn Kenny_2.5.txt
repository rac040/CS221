This movie is a loose remake of a  French crime drama written and directed by Jose Giovanni, who wrote a handful of classic genre pictures, including Jacques Beckers prison-break picture Le Trou,  Alain Corneaus gangster-on-the-run story Classe tous risques both  and  Jean-Pierre Melvilles one-last-caper Le Deuxieme Souffle .
  Negative
Giovannis original was a tense, lean narrative of a paroled con dogged by an old enemy, a cop with a grudge.
  Negative
This film, directed by  Rachid Bouchareb, best known in this country for his  Indignes aka Days of Glory, about North African soldiers fighting for France in World War II, makes the story a bit baggier, and, in a reach for contemporary significance, changes its setting to contemporary New Mexico and makes its paroled criminal a convert to Islam.
  Positive
In this update, the viewer knows things are going to end badly from the opening shots.
  Negative
One of the films characters is seen dragging an inert body over a desert landscape.
  Negative
Then, in a long shot, hes seen smashing the bodys head with a rock while screaming.
  Negative
The perspective reminded me of a similar death-seen-from-a-great distance scene, in  Abderrahmane Sissakos extraordinary   Timbuktu, but where Sissakos scene showed a quiet, implacable assurance, Boucharebs presentation has a slight ring of manipulative dynamics, and overdetermination.
  Negative
This feel persists over the course of many perfectly-framed vistas, including a shot of  Brenda Blethyn standing in a doorway that is practically begging the viewer to compare it to  The Searchers.
  Negative
But Blethyns recognizable presence also constitutes a godsend of sorts: when this film's excellent actors are given things to do, Boucharebs heavy-handedness is easier to ignore.
  Positive
Blethyns character is a parole officer.
  Neutral
Forrest Whitaker plays Garnett, out three years early from a twenty-year-plus sentence' seems he killed a deputy during his gang-banger times.
  Negative
Harvey Keitel is Agati, a humane but exceptionally businesslike sheriff who has an extreme grudge against Garnett.
  Negative
The movie takes its time with these characters.
  Positive
Garnett, praised early on by his spiritual adviser on having learned to control his anger theres the first-act gun-mention you always hear that Chekhov quotation pulled out about, rides around on a motorbike enjoying his newfound freedom while Agati seethes and ponders what hes going to do about this new problem preying on his mind.
  Negative
Blethyns character gives Garnett the old tough-not-quite-love treatment, bristling when he ingenuously boasts to her about a date with a woman hes about to go on.
  Negative
Tell her the truth, she bluntly advises him.
  Negative
And he does, eventually.
  Neutral
But once Agati starts harassing him, and once an old criminal associate  Luis Guzman starts trying to lure him back into the fold, Garnett starts coiling up into himself more and more.
  Negative
An explosion is bound to happen.
  Positive
The suspense is spiced up here by the culture clashes implicit in the environment and explicit in some of the characterizations.
  Positive
Early in the film Keitels sheriff asks Blethyns character to stop by a barbecue celebrating the return home of some troops whove been serving in Afghanistan.
  Negative
Garnetts devotion to his newfound faith doesnt impress Agati at all: in fact it seems to deepen his resentment of the character.
  Negative
Whats odd about Two Men is the fact that after establishing all of this material relative to character, Bouchareb, who co-wrote the adaptation with  Olivier Lorelle and Yasmina Khadra, allows it to all fall away.
  Negative
The story builds to a climactic confrontation, but not the one, perhaps, that weve been expecting, and then ends on a frustratingly indeterminate note that has little to do with the issues the movie went to the trouble to raise in the first place.
  Very negative
As exceptional as the acting in the picture is, and it is wonderful Whitaker and Keitel are as inventive and surprising as theyve been in years, and the supporting roles played by the likes of  Ellen Burstyn and  Stan Carp are well-sketched it cant entirely lift the movie from the rut it has all but plowed into by the end credits.
  Positive
