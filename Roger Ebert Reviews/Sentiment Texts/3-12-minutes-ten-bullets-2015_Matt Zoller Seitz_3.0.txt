  Negative
When the smoke cleared, -year old Jordan Davis was dead of gunshot wounds, and the car in which he and his friends had been traveling was riddled with bullet holes. "
  Negative
Minutes, Ten Bullets" is an account of the event and its legal and racial implications.
  Negative
It's told in a contemplative style that brings the story's emotions to life without hyping them.
  Positive
The shooter was  Michael Dunn,  and white.
  Neutral
Davis and his friends Leland Brunson, Tommie Stornes, and Tevin Thompson were teenage and black.
  Positive
The altercation started when Dunn and his girlfriend, Rhonda Rouer, stopped at a gas station.
  Negative
They pulled into a parking spot adjacent to the teenagers, who were blasting rap music.
  Neutral
Tommie Stornes was already in the store buying gum and cigarettes.
  Negative
Rouer entered the gas station's convenience store for white wine and chips.
  Negative
On her way inside, she heard Dunn complain about the teenagers' "thug music" Dunn later insisted he hadn't used that word, but had instead called the music "rap crap."
  Neutral
Dunn then asked the teenagers to turn it down.
  Neutral
Thompson complied, but then Davis told him to turn the music back up.
  Neutral
Dunn said Davis threatened to kill him, opened his car door and pointed what Dunn thought was a shotgun, and Dunn opened fire.
  Negative
But police who searched the vehicle found no evidence of any kind of weapon.
  Negative
Rouer later said that Dunn didn't say anything to her about a gun until a day later, though Dunn insists he described it to her repeatedly.
  Negative
Dunn was ultimately convicted of first-degree murder in fall, .
  Negative
An earlier  proceeding found Dunn guilty of second degree murder for shooting at the other teenagers in the car, but jurors could not agree on the first-degree murder charge for killing Davis.
  Negative
Dunn's legal team invoked Florida's "Stand Your Ground" law, which allows for the possibility of legally killing another person that the killer believes might pose a lethal threat.
  Negative
Davis' parents have subsequently called for a repeal of that law as well as tighter restrictions on guns.
  Neutral
This all adds up to as explosive a documentary topic as you'll ever see.The violence originates in multi-layered resentment racial, cultural and generational with "Stand Your Ground," gun control and machismo stirred into the mix.
  Negative
Luckily,  Marc Silver and his collaborators avoid anything that might seem inflammatory.
  Negative
They explore the case in empathetic, detached images that are carefully composed, and often beautiful in a sad way, and mostly resist the urge to treat people's suffering as a thing to be photographed.
  Positive
Shots of towering trees, knotted highways and urban southern panoramas squashed beneath blue-grey cloud banks contribute to a sense of spiritual torment.
  Positive
The documentary favors Davis' side of the story, partly because  Jordan's parents gave the filmmakers access to their lives and stories,  while Dunn, his girlfriend and his family apparently didn't.
  Negative
They're represented in the  film mainly through courtroom shots of them testifying and  listening to others' testimony.
  Neutral
But mostly the movie appears to side with Davis' parents because Dunn's story is full of contradictions and holes.
  Negative
He comes off seeming like very bad news even though Silver omits or glosses over details that might have made him even more unsympathetic, such as the fact that he and Rouer left the gas station where Dunn had shot a stranger to death without reporting the incident to the police, then went back to their motel and ordered a pizza.
  Negative
It's often said that when you're presented with conflicting accounts of  an event, the one that seems most plausible is probably correct.
  Negative
The movie  seems to align itself with that sentiment.
  Negative
There is nothing in the pasts of Davis or his friends to suggest that they would have had a shotgun in the car, which makes Dunn's insistence that he saw one seem like racist paranoia an excuse to act out a homicidal fantasy that he might've been nursing for years before pulling into that parking spot.
  Negative
The film goes into some detail about how, to quote one of Davis's friends, "'thug' is the new 'n-word,'" and establishes Dunn as a man with anger management issues that overshadowed his likable qualities.
  Negative
The most damning testimony, though, comes from Rouer.
  Negative
She could easily have taken Dunn's side and told authorities that she saw Jordan open the car door and pull a shotgun on her boyfriend actions that nobody else at the gas station saw, but she says she saw nothing of the kind, and disputes other key points of his account as well, including his insistence that he never used the word "thug" to describe the teenagers' music.
  Negative
Dunn told authorities that the following morning he called a friend in  law enforcement to arrange to talk to police, but Rouer later said that  the friend called Dunn, not the other way around, and the two men  didn't talk about the shooting.
  Very negative
There are no heroes in this story, but Rouer nearly qualifies.
  Negative
She sided with strangers over her own boyfriend because she thought it was the right thing to do, and when she breaks down on the witness stand, you can see how much the decision cost her.
  Positive
It all adds up to a portrait of a man who knows he's done something inexcusably awful and can't face the consequences.
  Negative
Police interrogation room footage and recorded phone calls contribute to the feeling that Dunn was disconnected from the murder, and cared mainly about his own fate.
  Negative
He's eerily dry and "rational," at times lighthearted, when he discusses the shooting with a detective after the event' he talks out various scenarios as if describing a fender-bender.
  Negative
There are moments in the audio where Dunn seems to be as callous and self-serving as his detractors claim, including a bit where he compares himself to "the rape girl that was attacked for wearing skimpy clothes."
  Negative
Silver's documentary occasionally suffers from lack of focus and clarity.
  Negative
There are times when the dreamy mood derails the narrative, and makes it seem as though the film is being swallowed by sadness over the events it's chronicling.
  Negative
And while the movie's determination to let us find our way through the story is laudable, onscreen titles might have helped establish where we are, and whom and what we're looking at.
  Negative
You don't learn the names of any of the supporting players including the lawyers until somebody says them out loud, and unless you're paying close attention to every word of the TV news stories that Silver samples, you might not know what month or year you're in, much less which courtroom trial you're looking at.
  Negative
There are also moments where you might wish that the mostly superb editing had found a way to shape the events more precisely, to pose questions that the film never asks in so many words, even though it seems to want to.
  Negative
Would a thorough mental-health screening process for gun licenses have prevented Dunn from carrying a handgun?
  Negative
Did anybody ask Dunn why he didn't immediately turn himself in after killing a stranger?
  Negative
Was Davis' angry response to Dunn's request that he turn the music down culturally "general" a teenage black manmiddle-aged white manrap thing thing or was it rooted in specific incidents from Jordan's life?
  Negative
One of Davis' friends says Jordan said he was tired of people telling him what to do, but this isn't followed up.
  Negative
These are not deal-breaking flaws, though.  "
  Negative
Minutes, Ten Bullets" doesn't move or look like most documentaries you've seen.
  Negative
The movie's meditative quality makes you feel for everyone involved in this tragedy even Dunn, who seems very much a prisoner of fear and anger.
  Negative
Where a lot of documentaries would try to stir outrage, this one just leaves you shaking your head.
  Negative
The numb feeling comes from the knowledge that what we're seeing onscreen the racial and generational animosity, the normalization of gun violence, the checklist of reasons why nothing can be done are just pieces of one more American day.
  Negative
