This movie, written and directed by  Aaron Nee and  Adam Nee, opens with the Notice from Mark Twains Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.
  Negative
You know well, I assume you know, the bit about Persons attempting to find a motive in this narrative ...  and so on.
  Negative
The thing an English teacher would tell you was ironic or satirical or something.
  Negative
At this point you might be thinking, Whats this movie called Band of Robbers got to do with Huck Finn anyway?
  Negative
and soon enough it answers your question.
  Neutral
Its a story of Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer, only its transposed to the present day, set in some unspecified sun-drenched place thats not the American South as depicted in Twains work.
  Negative
And, Huck and Tom are now young men.
  Neutral
And the band of robbers title isnt from out of nowhere, the phrase does appear in Adventures of Tom Sawyer in a scene where its title mischief-maker suggests the formation of Tom Sawyers gang.
  Negative
Does this sound to you like a good idea?
  Neutral
If yes, maybe youll enjoy this movie more than I did because I think its a bad idea thats badly done in at least two ways, maybe three, but however many there are theyre all fatal.
  Negative
The movie opens with a flashback of Tom and Huck as boys, with Huck reminiscing Tom was the closest thing to a real family I had.
  Negative
He saw a world where we were just one adventure away from all our problems disappearing.
  Negative
This sounds neither like Twains voice for Huck Finn, narrator, or Twains own close-third-person prose as used in  Tom Sawyer.
  Negative
Get used to that.
  Neutral
In this films universe, adult Huck  Kyle Gallner is a soulful and perhaps reluctant reprobate coming off of a prison stint, while Tom co-director Adam Nee is a cop who uses his position as a cover for trouble-making, all of it, in this case, centered around treasure-seeking.
  Negative
The treasure-seeking is of course a theme in Twains original tales, and the films first half-hour finds Tom engineering a pawnshop robbery scheme that plays out as a very poor imitation of  Wes Andersons  Bottle Rocket.
  Negative
Nees vocal inflections even take on a touch of  Owen Wilson during the attempted comedy of Tom explaining his master plan to his dumber-than-he-is accomplices.
  Negative
The actual robbery is complicated when Tom gets saddled with a new partner on his beat the very day of the robbery.
  Neutral
Shes the daughter  wait for it  of a powerful figure in the town  yes  its Becky Thatcher, played here by  Melissa Benoist, now TVs  Supergirl, which may end up the sole reason this movie winds up being cited any time anywhere.
  Negative
Yes, Hannibal Buress is also in the cast, but hes so relentlessly poorly used you tend to forget that, or want to forget it, for his sake.
  Negative
In any event, once the poor impersonation of Bottle Rocket is over, the Nees turn back to Twain.
  Negative
Not his prose style, or his humor, but rather his plotting and his use of racial stereotypesconventions.
  Neutral
The new-fangled character of Injun Joe, played by  Stephen Lang, who must have gotten tired of cooling his heels waiting for those new  Avatar pictures to start shooting, is given a whole new cultural appropriation bag.
  Negative
This is problematic, not because its politically objectionable, but because it sucks.
  Negative
Other innovations include the actual cave where the problematic climax of Twains work occurs changing into a motel called The Cavern.
  Negative
The Nees clearly want the liberties they take with Twain to constitute some sort of commentary on the work and its place in American culture, but their observations arent particularly smart or well-constructed or well-executed.
  Positive
Not that they would have necessarily been better off just making another bro-crime comedy-drama, but  well, I dont know what they might have been better off doing, frankly.
  Negative
Band of Robbers just plain doesnt work, to the extent that Im almost regretful that the attempted schoolroom bans on Twains work werent more effective over the years, as they might have spared me watching it.
