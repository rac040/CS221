The thing about The Grateful Dead is, if you tell some stranger that theres a new four-hour documentary about the band, he or she is likely to respond, Of course there is.
  Negative
The legendary band is legendary in part for its devotion to duration.
  Positive
Long concerts, long jams on songs, a long time on the road.
  Negative
This documentarys title, Long Strange Trip comes from Truckin, a song from its  album American Beauty.
  Negative
The band was only five years old at the time, although its ostensible leader, guitarist  Jerry Garcia, had been gigging professionally since .
  Negative
But the trip was going to get longer and stranger, grinding to a halt a quarter of a century after Truckin, with the  death of Garcia.
  Negative
There have been challengingly long docs about classic rock bands in recent years.
  Negative
s Runnin Down A Dream, directed by  Peter Bogdanovich, chronicled  Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and justified its length by dint of Pettys talents as a raconteur.
  Negative
Alison Ellwood's not-quite-four-hour  History of the Eagles could fly with the alternate title Blazing Egos.
  Negative
But of all the bands that might be considered for a gargantuan length film treatment, The Grateful Deads scale of achievement and actual profound cultural influence make them arguably second only to  The Beatles with respect to deserving such a treatment.
  Negative
And this movie, directed by  Amir Bar-Lev, makes every minute count.
  Negative
The movie is separated into six acts.
  Negative
In terms of how it looks and feels, it isnt too different from a lot of historical documentaries.
  Negative
There are many talking heads, and a lot of archival footage.
  Positive
Rhythm guitarist  Bob Weir, once the fresh-faced baby of the group, is now ruggedly white-bearded and sits in the lotus position throughout his interview.
  Negative
For guys who didnt much like posing for photos, theres a lot of good imagery both still and moving.
  Positive
The sound mix of the music is superb.
  Very positive
But the movie has virtues beyond mere ultra-competence.
  Negative
The six-act structure is more thematic than chronologically linear.
  Positive
This is not an and then X joined the band or an and then I wrote or an and then we made our difficult sophomore album kind of account.
  Negative
Percussionist  Mickey Harts several-year hiatus from the band a parental intervention, if I recall correctly doesnt come up.
  Negative
Tom Constanten, a keyboardist for the group in its earliest heyday, isnt mentioned or interviewed.
  Negative
What the viewer gets instead is a series of incredibly involving mini-movies, the first starring Barbara Meier, who was Jerry Garcias girlfriend in the early s and came back into his life after a long absence in the early s, most fatefully as it happens.
  Positive
Garcia himself is at his most eloquent in interview footage from late in his life, articulating how the improvisational approach the Dead brought to its music was informed by bluegrass more than jazz: Bluegrass is a conversational music' the instruments talk to each other.
  Positive
Already an accomplished guitarist in the early s, he went a little nuts when he discovered the banjo, practicing obsessively.
  Negative
As the psychedelic s emerge and evolve, the use of LSD dissolves egos within the band initially called The Warlocks, and inform the communal ethos that defines the Deads early lifestyle and its music.
  Negative
The movie takes the intimations of the cosmic in the music seriously.
  Negative
Around the point Ron Pigpen McKernan, the bluesman who was often the odd man out in the Deads furthest-out excursions, dies of cirrhosis of the liver in , characteristically blunt former road manager Sam Cutler observes, Alcoholics dont like acid' theyre trying to shut down the doors of perception, not open them.
  Negative
The bands opening of doors extended into aural realms, with their audio engineer and legendary acid mixer Owsley Bear Stanley building a mind-blowing and increasingly impractical PA system called the wall of sound.
  Negative
You have to see it to believe it.
  Neutral
These multivalent tales of the Dead are awe-inspiring and thought-provoking without fail.
  Positive
As is the section late in the movie, about the obsessive quests of Dead fans, one of whom includes U.S. Senator  Al Franken.
  Negative
But what starts off inspiring becomes dispiriting.
  Negative
The Deadhead caravan morphs into a tentacled unruly monster.
  Negative
Garcia, ostensibly the group leader, is such an genuine philosophical anarchist he refuses to condemn anti-social fan behavior just as he refused to bar Hells Angels from the backstage areas that often included whole families.
  Positive
I was reminded of  Vincent Cassels Otto Gross in  David Cronenberg and  Christopher Hamptons   A Dangerous Method, who shrugs Freedom is freedom when confronted with objections to his arguably damaging behavior.
  Neutral
And eventually Garcia falls victim to his own version of the Pagliacci joke: the engine behind a musical invention that brings joy to millions becomes depressed by the fact that he doesnt have his own Grateful Dead.
  Negative
Diabetes and heroin only make matters worse.
  Negative
As sad as Garcias end is, Long Strange Trip remains an exhilarating and inspiring movie.
  Positive
For a not inconsiderable period, Garcia, Weir, Hart,  Phil Lesh,  Bill Kreutzmann and various fellow travelers saw the possibilities that their talents and the times offered them, and made hay of them.
  Negative
I enjoy too many different kinds of music to become a true Deadhead comparing all those concert tapes looks like a lot of work!
  Positive
but I think the band was pretty great, and this wonderful movie has thrown me down a Dead rabbit hole that Im going to be happy to poke around in for quite a while.
  Negative
