You don't need to squint very hard to see the satirical elements that might have elevated blood-soaked horror flick "TheBelkoExperiment" to greatness.
  Negative
The premise a group of employeesare forced to kill each other at the whims of an anonymous employer is promising.
  Positive
But the script, penned by  James Gunn " Guardians of the Galaxy," "Slither", is undercooked, its violence foregrounded to the point of distraction.
  Negative
Many people will either love or hate this film based on how gory and aggressively cynical it is.
  Negative
But realistically, Gunn's biggest conceptual failure is that his scenario is thoughtlessly cruel.
  Negative
The characters could have embodied traits of typical office drones and managers, turning the film into a savage black comedy.
  Negative
But those elements aren't developed beyond a point, making the movie's only selling point its excessive gore and violence.
  Negative
You'll notice, from the start, how easy it is to either identify with or dismiss characters in "TheBelkoExperiment" based on how they respond to the stress of being told to kill their fellow employees.
  Negative
Never mind that stress makes people do crazy things: we're supposed to sympathize with by-the-book employee Mike John Gallagher Jr. because he's a moderate voice of reason compared to self-appointed megalomaniac Barry  Tony Goldwyn.
  Negative
Mike is the kind of guy who encourages his fellow employees to take the stairs, not the elevators while Barry is the kind of guy who says that the group should "consider our options" and think about cooperating with the mysterious uber-boss who's compelling them to kill each other.
  Negative
Both characters clash sooner rather than later because each employee has aGPS micro-chip implanted in their heads they are working in Bogota,where kidnappings aresupposedly not uncommon which is ultimately used as an explosive to pick off disobedient employees.
  Very negative
Secondary characters either voice their disapproval or support of Barry and Mike's respective positions: Mike insists that nobody has "the right to choose who lives and who dies" while Barry suggests that they have no choice.You may, at some point, wonder if Barry has a point.
  Negative
But that moment will pass when you see the other guys he's allied himself with, people like jittery, trigger-happy Lonny  David Dastmalchian and sexual-harassment-happy Wendell  John C. McGinley.
  Negative
There's no way to take the utilitarian position in this film because these guys are defined exclusively by personality-revealing bad behavior.
  Negative
Conversely, there's no way to relate to Mike because he's such a generic goody-goody.
  Negative
What kind of guy warns people to take the stairs and not the elevators during such an emergency?
  Negative
That's a half-serious question: I do not know anything about Mike beyond the fact that he handles stress well, talks other employees down from stress, and is a rational thinker given how much of the film's early expository speculation comes from him he's a bit chatty at the start, but necessarily so since he's essentially the lone voice of reason.
  Negative
There's no way to tell what he was like before theBelkobosses starting killing their employees off, nor any way to know why we should sympathize with the character beyond the fact that he's part of the solution and not the problem.
  Negative
Then again, the lack of motivation could have also been a source of great comedy.Belkocould be an office like any other: a placewhere bosses and fellow employees act kind and genial one minute but have the potential to transform into domineering thugs as soon as they fear they're going to be thrown under the bus.
  Neutral
That's who Lonny, the most sympathetic of Gunn's baddies, seems to be.
  Positive
But he's annoyingly knock-kneed, and ineffectual, making him instantly unlikable.
  Negative
McGinley's character is defined by his insincere toothy grin, and proud tendency of showing off his muscles, making his narcissism all too apparent.
  Negative
And Barry just wants to stay in control, as he shows when he undermines nice guy security guard Evan  James Earl by breaking into the company's weapons cache!
  Negative
.
  Neutral
This makes a bloody, unpleasant series of murders the only reason to see "TheBelkoExperiment."
  Negative
Director Greg McLean " Wolf Creek," "Rogue" fails to distinguish himself during medium close-up shots of heads exploding and torsos flailing.
  Negative
But McLean's contributions to "The Belko Experiment" aren't what makes the film so disappointing.
  Negative
Gunn's unimaginative conception of a "Battle Royale" meets " Office Space" style horror film I just bet that that was the elevator pitch holds a decent cast back from dying meaningful deaths.
  Neutral
Even the most diehard gorehounds and Gunn supporters should give this stinker a pass.
  Negative
