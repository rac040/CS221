Kelly Reichardt makes films so keenly in tune with the natural world that it seems appropriate that the director of Meeks Cutoff and Wendy amp' Lucy would turn to the world of eco-terrorism for her newest thriller, the excellent  Night Moves.
  Positive
Her story of three people caught in a web of mistakes and distrusts may first seem like a departure from her more character-driven dramas but, trust me, its not.
  Negative
Night Moves eschews traditional tension-building through plot twists and betrayals to focus on its characters, as Reichardt uses her increasingly impressive sense of composition and intuitive pacing to slow burn the audience into a state of anxiety instead of manipulatively pushing them there.
  Negative
Night Moves is about three people itching to make a statement in a world in which technology has overtaken agriculture.
  Neutral
Josh  Jesse Eisenberg, Dena  Dakota Fanning, and Harmon  Peter Sarsgaard are going to blow up a dam.
  Negative
The first half of Reichardts delicately timed narrative sees the planning of the event' the second details the inevitable fallout.
  Positive
Reichardt and her writing partner Jon Raymond dont weigh their narrative down with political rants or environmental messages.
  Negative
These are people who have had enough and feel that protests are no longer getting the attention their issues demand.
  Negative
That's all you need to know.
  Neutral
And that they're going to take action.
  Positive
As with all of Reichardts films, its more about the journey than the destination.
  Positive
As played by Eisenberg with more subdued detachment than usual and perhaps more than the part called for, especially in the final act, Josh is a deliberate, patient terrorist.
  Negative
Eisenberg and Reichardt sketch him too organically to call him calculated but Josh is definitely the most deliberate of the three terrorists.
  Neutral
Harmon, as perfectly captured by Sarsgaard in what ends up being a disappointingly small role, is more able to adapt to the situation.
  Positive
Sure, the waiter who recognizes him during part of their journey could be a problem.
  Negative
As is the fact that Harmon knows the guy from his time behind bars, which he failed to disclose.
  Negative
But it's not a big deal.
  Negative
Josh is the one who needs every detail to fall into place' Harmon is the one who rolls with the punches.
  Neutral
In between, we have the lovely Dena, closer to Harmon in her willingness to work with what shes given, such as in a masterfully tense scene involving the purchase of fertilizer, but clearly drawn to the brooding, purposeful Josh.
  Positive
Reichardt builds tension through the cumulative impact of seemingly minor moments.
  Neutral
What will be the downfall of this trio?
  Neutral
Will it be the aforementioned fertilizer scene?
  Neutral
Will it be one of the people that they seem to always inadvertently run into as their plan materializes?
  Negative
Will one of the three leads destroy their plan or betray the other two?
  Neutral
As one might expect who knows Reichardts films, the director avoids easy thriller clichs or even answers.
  Negative
Major events take place off screen.
  Neutral
A key one in the final act is shot with close-ups of eyes and feet.
  Positive
In Night Moves, as in all of Reichardts films, it is not just the incident that matters but its build-up and follow-through.
  Negative
And, again, she makes a decision with her ending that will frustrate some with its ambiguity but thrill those willing to accept her desire to work more in ellipses than periods.
  Positive
It should also be noted that Night Moves is a gorgeously composed film.
  Positive
Reichardts emphasis on the natural world in all of her films has led to an under-appreciation of her skills as a visual artist.
  Positive
As shot by the increasingly impressive  Christopher Blauvelt who also shot Meeks Cutoff and took over for Harris Savides after his passing on  The Bling Ring, "Night Moves" is one of the most literally dark films youll see this year.
  Positive
So much of it is lit by on-set sources like the dash of a car, the lights of a boat, the dim light of the moon, etc.
  Negative
This is not one of those awful blue-lit movies in which the moon casts a turquoise hue that one could read by in the real world.
  Negative
It is a film about people who move in darkness, willing to take chances for what they believe but only under cover of night.
  Neutral
