It should be agonizing, this tale of doomed love between cancer-stricken teens.
  Negative
It should be passionate, engrossing, suspenseful, something even unabashed melodrama would have been appropriate, given the subject matter.
  Neutral
Instead, the film version of the best-selling novel "The Fault in Our Stars" feels emotionally inert, despite its many moments that are meant to put a lump in our throats.
  Negative
Perhaps its trying so hard to bludgeon us over the head and make us feel deeply that the result is numbing instead.
  Negative
Theres something just off about it for the vast majority of the time an awkwardness to the staging, framing and pacing in director  Josh Boones adaptation of author  John Greens tear-jerking, young adult phenomenon, and a need to spell everything out.
  Negative
So much of what worked on the page and made Greens writing so lively and engaging gets lost in translation and feels uncomfortably precocious when actual people actually say his words out loud.
  Negative
Screenwriters  Scott Neustadter and  Michael H. Weber, who also wrote the romantic charmers "  Days of Summer" and " The Spectacular Now," remained very faithful to the book, which should make the core tweenteen fan base happy.
  Positive
Okay?
  Neutral
Okay.
  Neutral
Theres a specificity to Greens language' his characters are hyper-verbal, self-aware and fiercely biting in the tradition of " Heathers" and " Clueless."
  Negative
They know all too well that pop culture depicts cancer especially young people with cancer in a mawkish manner that they refuse to accept as they regard their own conditions.
  Negative
But while the flip, jaunty verbosity they use as a shield produces some pleasingly acerbic humor, it often feels forced and false in this setting.
  Negative
Still,  Shailene Woodleys abiding, disarming naturalism consistently keeps you engaged.
  Positive
She just doesnt hit a false note.
  Negative
Following winning turns in the indie dramas " The Descendants" and "The Spectacular Now," and the blockbuster " Divergent," Woodley continues to cement her accessible and likable on-screen persona.
  Very positive
Her work is so strong, it makes you wish she had a better performance to play off of to create the sparky chemistry at the heart of this story.
  Positive
Woodley stars as Hazel Grace Lancaster, a -year-old Indianapolis girl whos diagnosed with cancer at .
  Negative
It weakens her lungs, forcing her to drag an oxygen tank behind her wherever she goes and to stop to rest after climbing a flight of stairs.
  Negative
While her situation looked bleak a few years ago, participation in a new drug trial has prolonged her life for an indefinite amount of time.
  Negative
Her parents  Laura Dern and  Sam Trammell, with whom she shares some lovely, honest moments try not to hover over their daughter as she attempts to maintain some vague semblance of teenage life, and they even share her fondness for using dark humor to defuse difficult moments.
  Positive
Mom insists that Hazel attends weekly cancer support group meetings where comedian  Mike Birbiglia is the amusingly earnest leader.
  Negative
There, she meets the handsome and equally loquacious Augustus Waters  Ansel Elgort, who coincidentally played Woodleys brother earlier this year in "Divergent".
  Negative
A former high school basketball star, Augustus lost his right leg below the knee to the disease and now walks with a prosthetic.
  Negative
In Hazel, he immediately recognizes a kindred spirit: a quick-witted smart-ass who cant take any of the feel-good platitudes seriously.
  Negative
While Woodley navigates the complexity of Greens dialogue with ease, Elgort seems stiff and uncomfortable by comparison.
  Negative
His character is meant to be a bit pompous and formal in the beginning but instead comes off as nervous, and even seems to be rushing or slurring his lines at times.
  Negative
Elgort is boyishly handsome in a way thats distractingly reminiscent of " Love Story"-era Ryan ONeal, actually but never quite radiates the charisma required to keep up with Woodley.
  Negative
Their pairing feels like a missed opportunity.
  Negative
Hazel and Augustus shared love of reading inspires a trip to Amsterdam to seek out the reclusive writer of Hazels favorite novel, the fictitious "An Imperial Affliction," which also happens to be about a young woman living with cancer.
  Positive
Willem Dafoe brings a jolt of creepiness to the role of the alcohol-addled author, a rare sensation in a film that too often feels tidy.
  Negative
Their visit also sets the stage for the oddest scene of all in both the book and the film when Hazel and Augustus share their first kiss before an applauding crowd of tourists in the attic of Anne Franks house.
  Negative
Yeesh.
  Neutral
Yet we know this bliss cant last.
  Negative
And so "The Fault in Our Stars" descends into major hanky territory with an overpowering assist from a nearly omnipresent soundtrack of wistful alt-rock tunes that tell us what to feel, and when, and how much.
  Negative
I will happily admit to having tears stream down my face during the third act of Greens book but, alas, did not get choked up here.
  Negative
Theoretically, these iconoclasts wouldnt want their story to be told in such obvious and heavy-handed fashion.
  Negative
To borrow their favorite line from Hazels favorite book: "Pain demands to be felt."
  Negative
