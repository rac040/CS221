Weiner is a documentary that plays as cringe comedy.
  Negative
Like that sub-genre, it comes packaged with a star whose irascibility often leads to eye-covering levels of discomfort.
  Negative
Watching through your fingers, you find yourself telepathically communicating with its subject, seven-time Congressman and former New York City mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner.
  Negative
Walk away, dude!
  Positive
Your brain warns, just before all hell breaks loose.
  Negative
In one instance, the film reads your mind by presenting an onscreen person who asks, Why didnt he just walk away?
  Negative
But Weiner cant walk away, and the film leaves you to decide whether its because hes so passionate about the issues or hes just blessed with that New York City attitude so familiar to those who reside here.
  Negative
Whatever the reason, it makes for a very entertaining movie.
  Positive
The film follows Weiner as he runs in the  Democratic mayoral primary of New York City.
  Negative
This campaign is his return to politics after an embarrassing  scandal involving the boon of social media, the dick pic.
  Negative
The coincidence does not go unnoticed: A married man named Weiner sending out pictures of the body part that shares his last name is enough to give New York Post headline writers multiple orgasms.
  Negative
In fact, the first question asked by a New York Post writer during a phone interview with Weiner is, Whats your favorite headline of ours?
  Negative
Weiner is also a comeback story of sorts.
  Neutral
After initially lying about the sexted pictures, Weiner came clean and resigned from Congress.
  Negative
Prior to that, his reputation as a scrappy fighter for his Congressional district was well-known.
  Negative
The film shows the famous  clip of Weiners outraged rant on the floor of the U.S. Congress over a healthcare bill for  first responders.
  Negative
It follows this with a montage of positive, crowd-pleasing clips of Weiner from various news outlets.
  Positive
Then, just as we get the overview of a politician unafraid to rumble for his political beliefs, were suddenly confronted by a picture of some overheated mens briefs accidentally sent by Anthony Weiner to his entire Twitter feed.
  Negative
Its a jarring reminder that our own worst enemies are quite often ourselves.
  Negative
Yet another bait-and-switch awaits viewers unfamiliar with this story.
  Negative
Despite all the negative press after announcing his  run, Anthony Weiner finds himself atop the polls in the race.
  Negative
Theres a great scene on the MTA where New Yorkers recognize Weiner and display the stunned NYC newspaper headlines about his success.
  Positive
All seems to be forgiven, and once again the spotlight is on Weiners politics instead of his pecker.
  Neutral
And then the other shoe drops.
  Negative
Far more explicit pictures of Weiner hit the Internet, accompanied by dirty text messages delivered to various women.
  Negative
The scandal is far bigger than anyone anticipated, giving the sense that the politician had not been completely truthful during his original apology.
  Negative
While constituents feel betrayed, comedians like  Bill Maher and  Jane Lynch stage hilarious readings of the most salacious sexts involving Weiners online alter ego, Carlos Danger.
  Negative
Directors  Josh Kriegman and  Elyse Steinberg dont shy away from the jokes.
  Negative
They also dont turn away from the pain felt by all the players involved, from Weiners campaign staff, who believed in second chances despite opposition from family and friends, to Weiners wife Huma Abedin, to Weiner himself.
  Negative
Cameras seem to be everywhere, capturing things Im sure its subjects would rather not have been recorded.
  Negative
Only once does Weiner ask the camera to be shut off, and it occurs at such a horribly painful stare-off between husband and wife that I felt relief when the directors acquiesced.
  Negative
Occasionally, an offscreen voice behind the camera interacts with Weiner, echoing the sentiments that have just popped into the viewers mind.
  Negative
Did anybody ever tell you that you dont talk about your feelings?
  Neutral
the voice asks after receiving no response to a prior inquiry.
  Negative
Later, the voice asks the question guaranteed to be on the minds of anyone who watches this film: Why did you let me shoot this documentary?
  Negative
Its a good question, and Im not sure we get a satisfying answer to it.But I definitely got the feeling that, underneath Anthony Weiners brash exterior was a stoic resignation to eternally lay in the bed that he made, and he knows that he deserved its mattress.
  Positive
Weiner is not afraid to take its subject behind the woodshed, and more often than not, he goes willingly.
  Negative
Joining him for this very public flogging are the press, who come off as chattering parrots consistently fascinated by the same shiny object, and the American publics often infantile prudishness about sex.
  Negative
Reality TV-style celebrity, in the guise of one of Weiners sexting partners, is also up for a turn on the rack.
  Negative
The only person who really elicits any sympathy in Weiner and thereby penetrates the cringe comedy factor with genuine pathos is his wife, Huma Abedin.
  Negative
Abedin is a seasoned vet of politics, so she never comes off as a helpless victim or someone soliciting pity.
  Negative
She advises Weiner on the visual politics of when she should appear with him at events, undercutting clips of pundits who paint her as a wife dragged onstage by her shamed husband against her will.
  Neutral
Kriegman and Steinbergs camera always catches her thinking, often letting her remain onscreen in various states of professional and personal exasperation.
  Positive
Shes completely different from me, Weiner tells the directors after one particularly testy exchange.
  Negative
Is that what attracted her to you?
  Neutral
they ask.
  Neutral
I think its in spite of that, he glumly responds.
  Negative
Weiner is part-cautionary tale and part-punishment assignment, a darkly funny tale that makes one question why anybody would want to enter politics, especially when everything one does is scrutinized by a public court.
  Positive
