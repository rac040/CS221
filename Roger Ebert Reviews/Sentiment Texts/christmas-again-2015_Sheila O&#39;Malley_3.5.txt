One of the most important challenges for a director along with the cinematographer and editor of any given film is to create the proper mood for the story.
  Positive
Mood may be more important than words, because words come out of or are contextualized by mood.
  Positive
Mood is ephemeral, but it helps establish point of view and orients us in the dream-space of the film.
  Positive
With all of the things that "Christmas, Again" written and directed by  Charles Poekel in his feature debut does well and it does almost everything well, the most striking thing about it is its evocation of an extremely specific mood.
  Positive
Once we settle into it, and it happens early, everything else becomes possible.
  Negative
The lead character of "Christmas, Again" is named Noel  Kentucker Audley too cutesy a name to be believed, but it's skipped over like a pebble jumping across a pond.
  Negative
Noel spends most of his year working construction "upstate" but every Christmas time, he is one of those guys you see on almost every corner in New York, selling Christmas trees plus wreaths, stands and lights.
  Positive
It's seasonal work, and post-Christmas, those guys vanish suddenlyand then re-appear the next year.
  Negative
Poekel himself worked this seasonal job, and the film is great in showing how it all operates.
  Positive
Noel works the night-shift and oversees his two day-shift workers.
  Positive
And that's pretty much it, in terms of plot.
  Positive
Things do happen: Noel is annoyed at the lackadaisical attitude of his underlings "Nick, you gotta be better at sweeping up the needles, man...", goes every day to swim and shower at a nearby YMCA, buys Lotto tickets.
  Negative
Noel is quiet, but not apathetic about his job: he is ambitious to sell as many trees as possible.
  Positive
People who recognize him ask if "Marianna" is with him, and he replies, "Not this year" without elaborating.
  Negative
Maybe she's an ex-girlfriend.
  Neutral
It's not clear.
  Negative
Maybe they worked the Christmas season together and he had a crush on her and that's as far as it went.
  Neutral
That somehow seems more likely.
  Neutral
He seems like an unrequited kind of guy.
  Negative
None of these events are highlighted in a way that telegraphs "Here is the plot."
  Negative
"Christmas, Again" asks us to submit to the mood because that is where the profundity and emotion exists.
  Positive
New York is narrowed down to one corner, but on that corner a bustling diverse life occurs.
  Negative
Cinematographer  Sean Price Williams, who helped shoot Albert Maysles' "Iris," and also shot indie hit " Listen Up Philip", often blurs out the background, fuzzed-out colored strings of lights filling up the space behind people's faces.
  Negative
The light is harsh in the morning, and dark blue at night.
  Negative
You can feel how cold it is.
  Negative
Noel has interactions with various customers: an impatient guy with a Bluetooth who takes pictures of various trees to text to his wife "Hold the tree straight," Bluetooth guy commands, a seemingly flirtatious woman who admires the holly Noel put in the wreaths, a woman who asks "Do you have the Obama tree from Ohio?"
  Negative
, and anintense guy who asks, "Do women like Douglas fir or Balsam fir better?"
  Neutral
Some of the interactions have more reverb than others, but they remain isolated incidents with their own internal tensions and a strong cumulative effect.
  Neutral
One night, a guy comes up behind him and punches him in the head with no warning.
  Negative
Later Noel admits, "I been punched before" and you believe it.
  Negative
Kentucker Audley is a naturally charismatic actor.
  Positive
In " Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck,"  Courtney Love observes that her husband "had no idea he was as good-looking as  Brad Pitt," and you get the sense that Noel is the same way.
  Negative
His handsome face flickers with emotions, gone in a flash.
  Positive
When he does show humor, it is only in his eyes, but it's there, a slight wince accompanying.
  Negative
Audley draws you in in the way the old movie stars used to do: his emotions are clear and mysterious at the same time.
  Positive
Loneliness does not express itself in language.
  Negative
Loneliness is the air Noel breathes.
  Positive
It's in his posture.
  Neutral
There are glimpses of unexplained strangeness: In the trailer, Noel listens to what seems to be a tape of an old-timey melodramatic radio show.
  Negative
He keeps pills for anxiety?
  Neutral
pain?
  Neutral
sleep?
  Neutral
in different windows of a cheap Advent calendar, popping one a day.
  Negative
When Lydia  Hannah Gross, a drunk girl he helps one freezing night after finding her passed out on a bench in the park, with only one shoe, and gum tangled in her hair, shows up the next day with a pumpkin pie she baked to thank him, he's not sure how to react.A more conventional film would have had Lydia be the quirky girl who helps Noel find joy in the Christmas season.
  Very negative
"Christmas, Again" resists.
  Neutral
Lydia moves out of the film.
  Neutral
She returns, and leaves again.
  Positive
The two try to play cards.
  Neutral
She tries to talk to him.
  Neutral
He is kind but remote.
  Positive
Silence dominates but it's full, not empty.
  Negative
All of this may sound rather dull.
  Negative
But it's not.
  Negative
It's a beautifully observed film without any overt message thank goodness but drenched in melancholy and silence and cold.
  Neutral
Things sometimes resolve themselves, gently, only it's fragmentary, andnoneof it is "the point."
  Negative
The point is that Noel is a guy living a specific life in a specific season, dealing with emotions that are all over his face but never verbalized.
  Negative
There is no self-pity, no maudlin catharsis.
  Negative
The film has the courage of its convictions and confidence in its mood.
  Very positive
What a pleasure to watch a film that resists being about only one thing.
  Positive
That resists the conventional story.
  Neutral
That lets us enter into the life of another.
  Positive
"Christmas, Again" is also available on  Fandor today.
