Alain Gomis Flicit opens on the hustle and bustle of a small Congolese bar as the talkative, inebriated patrons wait for the evenings performance.
  Negative
Gomis and his DP  Cline Bozon capture the dark, freewheeling atmosphere with intimacy and tact.
  Positive
Bits of conversation trickle in and out of the soundtrack.
  Negative
Tender close-ups of patrons briefly dominate the frame.
  Negative
A loud drunk makes his presence known.
  Positive
Meanwhile, the Kasai Allstars perform a lively song that scores the evenings events.
  Positive
In this scene, Gomis never overtly highlights a central figure or even indicates a particular narrative.
  Negative
He simply marinates in the mood, trusting his audience to follow the tenor of the environment.
  Negative
In "Flicit," Gomis never settles into one particular rhythm, preferring to flex his range with different styles, each with their own specific tones.
  Negative
Though technically anchored by a narrative, Flicit never feels particularly beholden to it.
  Negative
Gomis merely uses it as a springboard to explore multiple different aesthetic avenues.
  Positive
The film routinely takes the form of a street level documentary, a concert film, and a near-silent character study.
  Positive
Gomis packs his movie with multiple interludes that are digressive but feel integral to his vision.
  Negative
Pardon the obvious description, but the sheer musicality of Flicit signals Gomis refusal to be pigeonholed into any category of filmmaker.
  Negative
Paradoxically, the initial narrative so strongly compels that its difficult for Flicit to recover after it runs its course.
  Negative
The films title character Vero Tshanda Beya, in an astonishing debut performance, a single mother and a club singer living in Kinshasa, lives her life independently.
  Positive
But when her -year-old son lands in the hospital after a nasty motorcycle accident, she embarks on a quest to gather the money necessary for an operation to save his leg.
  Negative
Gomis follows this proud woman as she rushes around the entire city collecting old debts and begging for money to help her son.
  Negative
Flicits strength derives from her staunch refusal to collapse under the weight of her circumstance.
  Negative
Bozon frequently captures Beyas face in tight close-up as she silently maneuvers through the chaos of the city, struggling to gather the necessary funds before its too late.
  Negative
Its clear that Flicit isnt one to ask or even beg for anything, let alone money from her cash-strapped peers and family members, but the position has rendered pride a luxury.
  Negative
The character and Beyas performance recalls  Marion Cotillards character in the Dardenne brothers recent feature  Two Days, One Night' Cotillard plays a desperate woman who must beg her colleagues to vote to keep her job, all while she combats her own mental illness.
  Negative
Watch Beya as she refuses to turn away from insults hurled at her face, or when she stands up to a local mob boss who refuses her request for a handout.
  Negative
Beya channels the unique power in simply refusing to yield to the worlds harsh burdens.
  Neutral
Gomis majorly shifts gears in the films second hour, moving away from the established narrative into broader territory.
  Positive
He focuses on Flicits personal journey, primarily her new relationship with a sweet local mechanic and frequent drunk Tabu  Papi Mpaka, as well as capturing Kinshasa street life.
  Positive
Though this has frequent pleasures, like a showcase for Mpakas tender yet boisterous performance, it doesnt retain the urgency of the films first hour.
  Positive
While the meandering interludes initially felt attached to Flicit and her plight, they eventually become too tenuous for them to have much impact.
  Negative
Worst of all, Gomis struggles to arrive at an appropriate conclusion' he chooses to end Flicit a few different ways, all of which have weight on their own, but less so when juxtaposed.
  Negative
Still, Flicit has a lyrical spirit that worms its way to the surface even at its most directionless, especially when Gomis squarely focuses on musical performances from the Kasai Allstars and the Symphonic Orchestra of Kinshasa.
  Positive
The former brings an exuberant energy, deriving from their mixture of multiple ethnic traditions, while the latter provides an ethereal quality that suggests an otherworldly presence within the frame.
  Very positive
Gomis weaves the music through Flicits personal exploration, providing extra potency to her soul search.
  Positive
Flicit argues that the world keeps spinning when any given crisis finishes.
  Neutral
The key is to keep up with it on your own terms.
  Positive
