Maybe its this years Charlie Countryman, a friend and colleague pondered as we exited the screening of Reach Me.
  Positive
Countryman, for those of you out there fortunate enough to have not seen it, and I believe that covers most if not all of you and Good Move, America!
  Negative
was s Most Incredibly Bad bad movie.
  Negative
A Europeanized Tarantino-Inflected Slab Of Hipster Tough Guy Puke, enlivened in this case by the oily presence of Shia I May Not Be A Garbage Human Being, But Ive Got A Heavy Investment In Making The World Believe Im One LaBeouf.
  Negative
Reach Me, written and directed by  John Herzfeld, is as it happens Incredibly Bad, but in a way thats more WTF than Countryman, which was insufferable in a let me out of here way.
  Very negative
Once youve sunk into the entirely warped groove of Reach Me youre almost eager to experience the next offense against aesthetics andor common sense it is poised to commit.
  Negative
And make no mistake: this is a movie that keeps on delivering, and for  solid minutes.
  Positive
The movie takes its title from that of a self-help text written by an ostensibly reclusive author, and how this book affects the lives of a motley crew of made-in-L.A. yoyos, from a hip-hop star to a couple of disaffected hit men to a lone-gun cop with an overactive conscience to a young actress whose supposed big-break opportunity turns into a sexual assault.
  Negative
And more!
  Positive
Because the author of Reach Me doesnt want publicity, and our Evil American Media believes theres something wrong with someone who doesnt want publicity, theres the Internet Tabloid Mucky-Muck who thinks that the author needs to be Taken Down, and who sends a young minion whos sold out to bad journalism when he ought to be writing the Great American Novel out to perform the task.
  Negative
In case youre wondering, yes, the movie does actively truck in the explicit tropes and conventions as described' its relentlessly brisk in laying out the hoary clichs.
  Negative
The scenario plays out as if a hyper -year-old whos read too many hard-boiled graphic novels decided to concoct his own version of  Paul Haggis  Crash.
  Negative
But wait, theres more.
  Negative
What if I told you that the Internet Tabloid Mucky-Muck was played by  Sylvester Stallone, and hes got a bunch of speeches in this movie that are full of multi-syllabic words and hes trying to spit them out in some form of staccato delivery?
  Negative
As the guy on the Ronco commercials used to ask Now how much would you pay?
  Neutral
Or that theres a scene in which the self-help book author, played by a puffy and seriously disengaged  Tom Berenger, breaks the Young Minion  Kevin Connolly, who initially appears wearing a fake beard thats really pretty adorable of his smoking habit by having him shout a magic sentence over and over again into the ocean at Redondo Beach?
  Neutral
The casting really does make the film: the likes of  Tom Sizemore,  Thomas Jane, Danny Aiello, and  Kyra Sedgwick have all of course delivered credible-or-better performances in their careers, but they all are capable of a certain, shall we say, broadness, and the unmitigated ludicrousness of the material allows all of them to go hog wild in the hamming-it-up-department.
  Positive
This leaves a less seasoned cast member like Elizabeth Henstridge sort of standing-at-the-sidelines probably thinking What is HAPPENING here, but its okay, shes young, shell get over it.
  Negative
Herzfelds wide trashy streak was of course highly evident from his very first picture, Two Days In The Valley, remembered these days largely for its Charlize Theron-Teri Hatcher catfight.
  Negative
Reach Me doesnt offer anything as immediately memorable, although the scene featuring Stallone painting as in fine art deserves to be widely circulated on YouTube.
  Negative
Its really got to be seen to be believed.
  Positive
I guess that can be taken as a recommendation, can it not?
  Negative
And that certainly wasnt the case with Charlie Countryman.
