Watching "Detroit," the latest film directed by  Kathryn Bigelow and penned by  Mark Boal, I hit a breaking point I didnt realize I had.
  Negative
I was disturbed so deeply by what I witnessed that I left the theater afterward in tears.
  Negative
It wasnt the relentless violence inflicted upon black bodies or the fiery devastation of the riots ripping apart Detroit but the emptiness behind these moments that got under my skin.
  Negative
Watching Detroit I realized that Im not interested in white perceptions of black pain.
  Negative
White filmmakers, of course, have every right to make stories that highlight the real and imagined histories of racism and police brutality that pointedly affect Black America.
  Neutral
There are, of course, a litany of films by white filmmakers about subject matter unique to the black experience that I find moving  The Color Purple comes to mind.
  Positive
But  Steven Spielbergs film was based on a novel by Alice Walker and produced by  Quincy Jones.
  Positive
Detroit was directed, written, produced, shot, and edited by white creatives who do not understand the weight of the images they hone in on with an unflinching gaze.
  Negative
Detroit is ultimately a confused film that has an ugliness reflected in its visual craft and narrative.
  Negative
Bigelow is adept at making the sharp crack of an officers gun against a black mans face feel impactful but doesnt understand the meaning of the emotional scars left behind or how they echo through American history.
  Negative
Detroit is a hollow spectacle, displaying rank racism and countless deaths that has nothing to say about race, the justice system, police brutality, or the city that gives it its title.
  Negative
The film builds up to an extended sequence based on a real event, a police raid at the Algiers Motel in  Detroit that resulted in the deaths of three young black men and the beatings of nine other people, including two white women.
  Positive
There is a shagginess to the narrative as it opens, giving a portrait of the civil unrest and riots that dominated Detroit at the time before placing the variety of characters introduced into a powder keg of a situation at the Algiers Motel.
  Negative
After the blood has dried and scars began to heal for the survivors, the narrative dashes through the investigation, trial, and aftermath of that night.
  Negative
There is an increasingly heavy reliance on newspaper clippings and actual newsreel footage meant to provide meaning and gravitas that only highlights the lack of a thematic center to grant the film any weight.
  Negative
Bigelow has made a career out of zeroing in on the particular textures of American masculinity.
  Positive
Its one of the reasons I particularly love her earlier work whether that be the sublime and unapologetically silly Point Break or the gloriously intense Near Dark.
  Positive
Its this history that makes the surface level understanding of character so glaring.
  Negative
The film gestures at the ways black and white men are pitted against each other but doesnt reckon with the historical lineage this conflict rests in.
  Negative
Consider when the two white women Julie  Hannah Murray and Karen  Kaitlyn Dever are found hanging out with a black man recently honorably discharged, played by  Anthony Mackie, just as the raid on the motel begins.
  Negative
This gets into complex territory about stereotypes of black men, the perceived value of white women, and white mens fear that the film doesnt know how to address meaningfully.
  Neutral
While  John Boyega has been top-billed for his performance as Melvin Dismukes, a security guard who stumbles into aiding the blatantly racist cops and armed forces that realize the civil rights violations happening but do nothing to stop it, hes too passive a character to leave much of an impression.
  Negative
In standing by his position as an authority figure and helping these white cops, Melvin becomes complicit in their horror.
  Negative
Boyega is a charismatic actor, but he gives a flat performance, although its the script thats more of a problem.
  Negative
Mark Boal skirts around the issue of Melvins complicity, leaving an interesting story on the table.
  Negative
The standout from the cast proves to be  Algee Smith, who grants his character a soulfulness and yearning that grows more heartbreaking as the film continues, but even his performance is often undercut by directorial choices.
  Negative
There are plenty of examples of racism in the film, but it's William Poulters performance as Philip Krauss, a cop who becomes a ringleader to horror at the Algiers Motel, thats the most sickening.
  Negative
Krauss is quick to violence, virulently racist, and immensely cunning.
  Negative
He delights in beating the black men who realize hes abusing his power but can do nothing to stop him even as dead bodies pile up.
  Positive
Bigelow doesnt flinch from depicting Krauss horror, but she also doesnt thoroughly indict him or the systems that allow men like him to survive.
  Negative
Before the films release, a lot of fury was unleashed when it became clear that black women wouldnt be important to the story.
  Negative
Films about black history seldom grant black women the importance they deserve.
  Positive
In Detroit, they are in the margins.
  Neutral
Theyre dutiful wives placing a gentle hand on the shoulder of their husbands' theyre silent spectators in courtrooms' theyre sweet motel clerks with no real weight in the story.
  Negative
An elder black female character voices dialogue that is the closest the film gets to any commentary: No way would they do this to white men, she says angrily to a news reporter hungry for a good pull quote.
  Negative
But Detroits disinterest in black women, despite significant time spent beyond the Algiers Motel, is the least of its problems.
  Negative
What leaves the film feeling grotesque and even a bit exploitative is its soullessness.
  Very negative
Ive had a theory for some time that you can determine how well a film will handle its black characters based purely on how its shot.
  Positive
Black skin tones vary widely, but here theyre often ashen, sickly, and lacking the complexity they deserve.
  Very negative
Cinematographer  Barry Ackroyd hews toward a psuedo-documentary style that is perpetually in jittery, confusing motion.
  Negative
Bigelow and Ackroyd excel at creating tension until the Algiers Motel incident takes on the tenor of an extended trip into purgatory.
  Neutral
The sweat and blood that drips down the characters' faces are granted such texture and focus I could practically smell them wafting from the screen.
  Negative
Bigelow is immensely skilled at action, and watching Philip pick off his victims definitely crackles with energy.
  Very positive
But there is a noxiousness to the thrill of these scenes and the extreme close-ups of bruised black bodies, because the characters lack interiority.
  Negative
The soullessness of the film only snapped into focus for me near the very end when one of the survivors, Larry, is shown singing at church.
  Negative
The church is important to the black community both as an emblem of hope and resistance.
  Positive
But this scene is shot exactly like the most disturbing moments at Algiers Motel.
  Negative
The camera moves much like a boxer.
  Neutral
It bobs and weaves staying perpetually in motion.
  Negative
There is an anxious energy and bluntness that feels out of place as Larry sings in front of the black congregation.
  Positive
When I left the theater, I overheard a black filmgoer say repeatedly, This is still happening.
  Negative
This is still happening.
  Neutral
I only looked at him briefly, but in his voice there was a weariness and disappointment I felt myself.
  Very negative
Given how nothing has really changed in America for black folks, Detroit had the potential to be a valuable, even powerful, piece of art that could speak truth to power.
  Negative
But it lacks the authenticity necessary to become that.
  Negative
Bigelow and Boal dont shy away from showing how loathsome Philip and his cohorts are.
  Negative
But they dont go so far to indict them or grant enough context to their actions.
  Negative
There are also brief, disconcerting moments that present some white cops in a great light.
  Positive
Ultimately, I was left wondering who is this film really for?
  Negative
The filmmakers arent skilled enough to understand the particulars of blackness or bring the city of Detroit to life as another character.
  Negative
What is the value of depicting such nauseating violence if you have nothing to say about how that violence comes to pass or what it says about a country that has yet to reckon with the racism that continues to fester within its very soul?
  Negative
Detroit is presented as a valuable portrait of a bloody, violent, and important moment of American history.
  Positive
The epilogue detailing what happened next for everyone involved over pictures of the real-life versions of the characters and story gestures at vital commentary about racism that the filmmakers never get a handle on.
  Negative
Bigelow, Boal, and their collaborators are unable to meaningfully parallel this event to the present-day happenings they mirror.
  Negative
Watching Detroit, I didnt see a period drama, but a horror film.
  Negative
The horror of white filmmakers taking on black history and the violence perpetuated upon black bodies with an unwavering eye yet nothing to say.
  Neutral
