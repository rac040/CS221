This sequence announces the film's intentions: "The Incredible Jessica James" is an old-fashioned star vehicle.

You have.

A dinner with a recently-divorced guy named Boone  Chris O'Dowd seems to have potential, but they're both so bruised by their former relationships that it's like there are two other people sitting at the table with them.

The relationship with Boone is really the heart of the film.

You haven't seen it with these two particular people.

Her laugh at his joke bursts out of that shell, and with it comes a softening, a vulnerability.

I never doubted for a second that Jessica Williams the actress knew what her character's scripts were about.

But we the audience never learn about them.
  Neutral
The other element of the film that doesn't quite work are the fantasy sequences involving run-ins with her ex-boyfriend.

Stanfield is such a versatile actor, but the "device" clearly " Annie Hall"-ish in its intention is too sloppily conceived to really come off.

  Very positive
In many ways, self-knowledge is more important and even harder to come by than talent.
