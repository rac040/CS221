Quentin Tarantinos  " Pulp Fiction" gets a lot of grief for wellspringing, that is, for inspiring a container ship gross of largely inferior "edgy" genre pictures overstuffed with blood, guts, octane, and classic rock soundtracks.
  Very negative
To spread around disapprobation where its due, I think the  film version of Irvine Welchs novel " Trainspotting," as good a film as that was, also brought into being a subgenre that got real tired real fast, a subgenre involving the gritty and repellent depiction of a world of sex and drugs, a depiction that also partakes of a certain giggly amorality calling itself "anarchy," or something more high-minded, while playing that against an occasional po-faced assessment of the consequences of such a mode of life.
  Negative
Facile "pungent" irony and alternative rock soundtracks optional.
  Negative
In , theres actually something mildly anachronistic about "Filth," writer-director Jon B. Lairds adaptation of a  novel by Welch.
  Negative
The movies opening credits play over a retro-lounge rendition of "Winter Wonderland."
  Neutral
Theres a low-angle shot of what appears to be the worlds longest dressing room floor, black and white chessboard tile, and at the end of the line, a beautiful woman in lingerie with her back to the camera is putting on lipstick, looking at herself in the mirror.
  Negative
Its all very  imagining its .
  Neutral
When DOES this movie take place, anyway?
  Neutral
The fact that its lead character, Bruce Robertson, is seen watching a television program or "programme" as they say across the pond' the movie is set and was made in Scotland featuring papier-mch headed character Frank Sidebottom suggests late s-early s.
  Negative
The fact that hes watching said programme while masturbating and making an obscene phone call to the unsuspecting wife of a "friend" says a bit about Bruces character, of course.
  Negative
Hes a cop, a bad one, and hes gunning for promotion, and his obscene phone call stunt is one of the many machinations hes using to achieve that aim.
  Negative
Or so he believes.
  Neutral
To be fair to "Filth," which boasts a creditable cast featuring  James McAvoy in the lead role,  Jamie Bell,  Eddie Marsan,  Imogen Poots,  Jim Broadbent, and others, the movie is not exactly what its initial flurry of sarcastic voiceover "When did a single-figure IQ ever hold anyone back in the police force?"
  Negative
, cheeky irony, and unrelenting depiction of drinking and drugging make it seem.
  Negative
Its actually something just a bit worse.
  Negative
Rather than a how-sweet-to-be-a-lout story that turns semi-cautionary, "Filth" attempts to depict genuine madness.
  Negative
More than merely an out-of-control sybarite prone to the corrupting influences of power, Robertson is supposed to be a Genuinely Broken Man.
  Negative
One who Used To Be Good.
  Neutral
Or at least Had Potential.
  Neutral
I understand such things do happen in life, but in "Filth," the movie, such things are laid out in ways that become almost reliably predictable and unenlightening.
  Negative
A side trip for the lead characters to Hamburg ends with the boys chased out of a sex club to the strains of " Luftballoons," can you believe it?
  Negative
As the movie goes on, what had at first blush seemed a Macbeth-type scheme on Robertsons part is revealed to be a complete non-starter, and the viewer is ostensibly plunged into the characters tortured psyche.
  Negative
But theres nothing really revealing therein, just more pastiche' a character who morphs into a version of Carrolls White Rabbit, a dialogue exchange that turns into a musical number.
  Negative
McAvoys nudge-nudge performance has a similarly tired quality.
  Negative
"Filth" demonstrates that contemporary filmmakers would do well to find  new ways of getting their hands dirty.
  Positive
On the plus side, a viewing of  the movie might temporarily cure just about anyones nostalgia for the  mud.
  Negative
