My All American earns most of its single shiny star by wasting no time in confirming its outright mushiness.
  Negative
Its first scene involves  Aaron Eckhart, aged to a Clint Eastwood-like stoicism with the emphasis on white caterpillar eyebrows, answering a poor reporters simple question about who his favorite All American player was, through his illustrious years of head-coaching the University of Texas to oodles of football victories.
  Negative
Freddie Steinmark, he says.
  Negative
But he wasnt All American, replies the reporter.
  Negative
No, Eckhart pauses.
  Negative
He was My All American.
  Positive
This film is based on a true story.
  Positive
For those who dont take that titular line-drop as indication to head toward the nearest exits, My All American offers viewers a thoroughly shameless hero piece.
  Negative
The titular personal champ is that of Freddie Steinmark  Finn Wittrock, a perfect specimen of a high school football player in the s who seems to just be a little too short for college football, but he still has pro ball dreams.
  Negative
Surely enough, with his teammate James  Juston Street and his beau at his side  Sarah Bolgers Linda, he makes it to UTexas, where he proves that his height is not really that much of an issue, and immediately impresses the legendary Coach Royal Aaron Eckhart.
  Negative
Lacking the tobacco-chewing guff of every other clichd coach in the movie, Coach Royal loves Freddie unquestionably, and never makes the viewer feel like Freddie has any obstacles to tackle.
  Negative
With a lead character who proves just how gratingly unnatural perfectionism is to human beings, especially non-fictional ones like Freddie, writerdirector  Angelo Pizzo eschews any sense of true conflict for  minutes so that we can see how great of a player he must have been: Freddie gives gleaming, hopeful handshakes any time hes humbly upgraded in the squad by Coach Royal, himself a boring statue.
  Negative
Fast Freddie is the speediest player on the squad but wont emotionally ditch his teammates.
  Negative
As a member of the UTexas, hes the first one to arrive at the locker room in the morning, and the last one to leave, because hes doing his studies.
  Negative
His shirt is always tucked in.
  Neutral
He prays during montages.
  Positive
You spend the whole movie expecting him to die.
  Negative
Sure enough, once My All American stops playing out like a grating montage with some football games mixed with shiny moments of Freddie Doing Good , as set to incessant Aaron Copland-esque fanfare, something bad happens.
  Negative
It takes about  minutes for My All American to take its true form as an homage to a football program, when UTexas ascended from a low record to the  Cotton Bowl while Freddie had a personal battle off the field.
  Positive
During this, Pizzos film does not aim towards any rich emotional victory, but it does want to show Freddie getting a five-minute standing ovation.
  Negative
To a credit for which he deserves better gigs, Wittrock shows a commitment to Pizzos bizarre vision, going along with the films desire to feel like its script was found in a -year-old time capsule, as originally composed with a PSAs squeaky cleanliness.
  Negative
Oh, how fragile are these young American men who just want to wrestle over a pigskin and make mothers of their girlfriends.
  Negative
But be not fooled by its stalwart, magic hour machismo, My All American is very much a Nicholas Sparks-esque weepie about a man and his football team, with the same delusional romance about The One.
  Negative
Even its loving exchanges between teammates on the gridiron affectionate nicknames like Little Dink or in the locker room create a groaning comedy, as the story yearns to indulge a nostalgia for something that could have never existed like this, University of Texas lore be damned.
  Negative
But for those looking for a sports film of basic quality and genuine narrative, "My All American" is definitively useless.
