Films about writers are tough enough.
  Positive
Films about writers who think theyre the smartest person in the room and too cool for the love story in which theyre essentially starring are even more ill-advised.
  Neutral
Such is one of the many problems with Playing It Cool, a movie that suffers greatly from its tendency to constantly remind you that This is a Film About WRITERS.
  Negative
Our narrator not only comments on the action of the piece incessantly, hes credited as Me.
  Negative
And the narcissism doesnt stop there.
  Negative
This Me constantly reminds us about how differently writers see the world, how idiosyncratic they are, how smart they are, how much better they are than you, etc.
  Positive
Its like being stuck in the head of a Creative Writing student who looks down on everyone else's major.
  Negative
And the film ultimately falls victim to the false assumption that highlighting clichs makes them easier to bear, when, in fact, I find the opposite true.
  Negative
Embrace your manipulation, dont pretend youre above it before you use it.
  Negative
Only the really strong cast, including great chemistry between the leads, keeps Playing It Cool from totally derailing.
  Very positive
Chris Evans plays the narrator, a lovelorn, one-night stand type whose mom left him years ago with a note on the Capn Crunch and whose heart isnt just on his sleeve, its taken form and follows him around, chain-smoking.
  Negative
Then, of course, he gets smacked in the face with love when he meets  Her, played by the lovely  Michelle Monaghan.
  Positive
It wouldnt be a movie if our object of desire was single, and so we get an uptight beau named Stuffy  Ioan Gruffudd to eventually overcome.
  Negative
More problematic for our hero is the fact that he doesnt really believe in the love in which hes falling.
  Negative
He talks through his concerns with writer friends Scott  Topher Grace, Lyle Martin Starr, Mallory  Aubrey Plaza, and Samson  Luke Wilson a group of characters so poorly realized that I started to wonder if they werent all figments of our writers imagination.
  Negative
Playing It Cool is so self-consciously trying to convince viewers that its the smartest romantic comedy in years that it never bothers to create characters.
  Negative
Im sure writerdirector  Justin Reardon thought he was being clever in his construction unnamed characters who constantly comment on their own clichd situations but the result is an annoyingly pretentious piece of work.
  Negative
Theres more commentary about writing and love in Playing It Cool than actual romance or friendship.
  Positive
It defiantly fails the show, dont tell argument.
  Negative
It is all telling.
  Neutral
Which adds to how remarkable it is that Evans and Monaghan keep the film from becoming totally unbearable.
  Positive
Hes likely to always be most famous for Captain America, but Ive always found him a likable actor believable, charismatic, smart.
  Positive
Evans is up for anything.
  Neutral
Its Reardons fault that he doesnt give him anything consistent to do.
  Negative
Evans writer is a total narcissist he literally puts himself in the leading roles of every story his writer friends tell him.
  Negative
Lovely, right?
  Positive
And yet Evans is too likable to make this guy the total asshole he probably would be in real life.
  Negative
Similarly, while we never quite understand what Monaghan would see in him besides the physical, shes a typical delight.
  Negative
Shes another actress Id love to see get better work.
  Neutral
Maybe they should both stay away from films about writers.
