Xu Haofeng, writer of  Wong Kar-Wais  The Grandmaster," returns to the martial art known as Wing Chun in The Final Master."
  Negative
This time, instead of chronicling Ip Man, the Wing Chun master who trained Bruce Lee, Xu focuses on Chen Shi Fan Liao, a 's-era master who wants to bring Wing Chun to Tianjin, a city in Northern China.
  Negative
Chen Shi wants to honor his masters dying wish to open a school there, so that this particular martial arts discipline may live on for future generations.
  Negative
Pitching a tent for Wing Chun wont be easy for Chen Shi.
  Negative
As more than one person will state during The Final Master," this is Tianjin, and there are rules and regulations to be followed.
  Negative
Ill be honest with you: Said rules and regulations get so complicated that I lack the clarity to fully describe them to you.
  Neutral
But, damn if I didnt enjoy listening to every single word in Xus adaptation of his short story.
  Positive
Theres a pulpy, novelistic richness to the proceedings' the characters utter lines as purple as Princes aura while they cross and double-cross one another.
  Negative
Power struggles are imbued with a stubborn sense of tradition that almost justifies their occasional descent into absurdity.
  Negative
Theres politics and military actions and a powerful nemesis named Master Zou Wenli Jiang, whose chill demeanor is the most entertaining thing in the picture.
  Positive
Master Zou makes the rules in Tianjin, and in order to open a school, one has to defeat eight of Tianjins champions of rival schools.
  Negative
But thats not all.
  Neutral
One must also be a native of Tianjin to ultimately have the school be accepted as legitimate.
  Negative
Being an outsider from Canton, Chen Shi must stroll into Tianjin with the manufactured appearance of a married man out to train a local resident as the apprentice who will battle the rival schools.
  Negative
Zhao Guohui Jia Song, the former working girl who marries Chen Shi, has her own agenda and a tragic backstory singed with scandal.
  Negative
The apprentice, Geng Liang Chen  Yang Song also has his own agenda and tragic backstory.
  Negative
In fact, everybody in The Final Master has an agenda and a tragic backstory.
  Negative
Theyre always revealed in dialogue rather than flashbacks, and for the most part, they dont matter as much in the final outcome.
  Negative
You may find this problematic, even annoying.
  Negative
But Im the guy who lives for the sci-fi movie moments where scientists rattle off rivulets of extraneous, expository technobabble.
  Negative
So I felt right at home with all these character detail MacGuffins.
  Positive
Anyway, Geng Liang Chen turns out to be better at Wing Chun than Chen Shi ever imagined.
  Negative
Hes a prodigy, says the shifu as his pupil goes through competitor after competitor.
  Negative
But Chen Shi has plans to get the glory of defeating the Tianjin masters himself, with some assistance and explanation from older rival Zheng Shanao Jin Shijie.
  Negative
Zheng wants one last battle to keep his honor and status in Tianjin, or something like that.
  Positive
Chen Shi plays along, but his intentions are to use his allies as chess pieces en route to his own personal checkmate.
  Negative
When Zhao Guohui realizes Chen Shi plans on double-crossing his rival and his apprentice, shes neither surprised nor pleased, but she sticks around to root for her husband.
  Negative
The women in The Final Master are as thinly defined as the men, but they are given extra little perks of character that I found intriguing.
  Positive
Master Zou has a defiantly androgynous look thats never once commented on, and she exerts her power with the calmest of demeanors, even when addressing the fearsome military men who represent Tianjins ultimate transition into a more militaristic entity.
  Negative
And Zhao casually mentions that she prays to Rudolph Valentino, whose picture was given to her by the foreigner whose sexual attentions unfairly made her a pariah to her family.
  Negative
Whether Rudy answers her prayers, Ill leave you to discover.
  Negative
Zhao also figures in a scene involving a departing train that feels imported from an old Hollywood studio picture, with their romantic shorthand for trains included.
  Negative
As for the fights: There are plenty of well-choreographed battles in The Final Master."
  Negative
The award-winning choreography eschews wire work, keeping the action sequences squarely on the ground.
  Positive
Chen Shi, Geng Liang Chen and their numerous adversaries use a variety of cutlery, from cool, circular, defensive hand devices to comically gargantuan single blades that are almost bigger than the men swinging them.
  Negative
Since Chen Shis goal is, as one character puts it, to maim, not to kill, the battles arent too gory or brutal.
  Negative
Instead, one focuses on the skilled craftsmanship that both fighter and filmmaker employ.
  Positive
Theres a late reel battle in the narrowest of alleyways thats as exciting as anything in recent memory.
  Negative
This is a juicy, beach read of a movie, the kind of overstuffed story youd devour in book form while slumming on the sand under an umbrella.
  Positive
