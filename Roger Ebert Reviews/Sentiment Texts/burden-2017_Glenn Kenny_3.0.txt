Urban Light, an art installation on the grounds of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, by the Wilshire Boulevard entrance, is, I think its safe to say, one of the most popular pieces of public art in the United States.
  Very positive
The elegantly arranged sculptural array of over  old-style street lamps, which via solar power snap on at dusk and go out after dawn, has been featured in more than several feature films, on the covers of Los Angeles tourism brochures, in television commercials for California, and so on.
  Negative
Not bad for a work that is not yet even ten years old.
  Negative
It is, among other things, a remarkably friendly and accessible piece of public art' unlike Richard Serras controversial  Tilted Arc, a curved raised scar across the plaza of New Yorks Federal Plaza' a challenge in the form of an artwork that was answered by its  removal from the space.
  Very positive
The irony of Urban Light and its magical reputation is that it is the work of an artist who had at one time been one of the most controversial, and vitriol-inspiring, of the late  th  century:  Chris Burden, the subject of this consistently fascinating documentary.
  Very positive
The movie begins with one of Burdens most memorable statements.
  Positive
A television commercial he made in the early s, and paid to place on various stations, reeling off a list of great artists names: Leonardo, Michelangelo, Rembrandt, Van Gogh, Picasso, and ending with his own name.
  Negative
I was gonna use Warhol too but he was still alive and I didnt want to give him a free commercial, Burden says to an interviewer from that era, a dark haired loudly-dressed man who it took me a little while to recognize as Regis Philbin, who did indeed have an L.A. chat show on television in the s.
  Negative
Then theres newer footage of Burden leading the film crew around the grounds of his seemingly airplane-hangar sized studio near Topanga Canyon.
  Neutral
He speaks of his habit of hiking around the grounds' it takes a whole two hours to circle it, he says.
  Negative
In his mid-sixties at the time of shooting, he seems both calm and robust.
  Positive
Through narration, interviews, and some really amazing archival footage crudely shot stuff documenting his exploits in conceptual and performance arts filmmakers  Richard Dewey and  Timothy Marrinan cram a lot of incident and ideas into Burdens life story.
  Negative
The young Burden spoke with an eerie calm that you could see as rather seductive, and he sure needed that quality, many of his contemporaries confirm, in order to pull off some of his schemes.
  Positive
He grew up the son of an engineer who consulted at MIT, and like his dad, he had big ideas as he studied to be an architect so big he wasnt willing to wait through an apprenticeship to realize them.
  Negative
He turned to art instead, and took a determinedly conceptual road, living in a padlocked locker for five days as his first piece.
  Negative
We werent sure if he was dangerous or crazy, one of his school friends remembers.
  Negative
Around this time the British art critic Brian Sewell turns up to bemoan the lack of craft in such work and insist that its not at all.
  Negative
Burden, giving an account of his thinking, discusses the dimensionality of sculpture, the active nature of apprehending it youre supposed to walk around and on concluding that sculpture is action lays the groundwork for his increasingly outrageous pieces, the most well-known of which have the artist actually getting shot with a rifle the details of this performance are more terrifying than that description even directly implies or having himself semi-crucified on the back of a Volkswagen Beetle whose engine is revved to maximum for two minutes while he lies there.
  Negative
The object, Burden says, was to explode the car.
  Negative
What then?
  Neutral
The work also inspired the  David Bowie couplet Tell you who you areif you nail me to my car.
  Positive
I keep wanting not to say the word sado-masochistic, the critic Peter Schjeldal says, settling on sinister to describe both Burden and his work at the time.
  Negative
Even the less famous pieces, such as one in which he laid behind a pane of glass at the Chicago Art Institute  for several days.
  Negative
One critical skeptic who became a kind of believer in Burdens artistic legitimacy was our own  Roger Ebert, who at first was among those who considered Burden an Evel Knievel of art but admitted that once he saw Burdens Chicago piece it stuck with him, making him ponder the nature of time itself.
  Negative
The movie goes on to chronicle Burden moving away from performance and starting to build actual things, after a period when sustained drug abuse and strained personal relations were indeed causing him to act in dangerous ways on an extracurricular basis.
  Negative
His early works involving craft were not initially benign.
  Positive
When you hear him say, I was thinking about flywheels a lot, you say, uh oh.
  Negative
Artist Ed Ruscha describes his terror at being in the same room with the contraption.
  Neutral
Jonathan Gold, the legendary L.A. food critic who was once an assistant to Burden, observes of the late work, The idea that hed become loved and emblematic of Los Angeles in that cuddly way no one would have thought of that.
  Negative
One thing I found missing from this movie was more explanatory material the hows and whys of Burden changing his process.
  Negative
Certainly a piece such as Urban Light fits into his views about sculpture and activity.
  Positive
I can put that together.
  Neutral
But I wanted to hear more anyway.
  Neutral
Burden died in , at age , of a cancer he had battled for a while.
  Negative
The story of how he unveiled his last piece is a testimony to his passion and commitment.
  Positive
He was a real artist and, especially if you believe that art is all about asking questions, about life and about art, he was a great one.
  Positive
