Pablo Larrans The Club introduces its characters in opening scenes that highlights their daily activities.
  Positive
Though the first is a long shot of a man playing with his dog on a beach, Larrans camera more often stays close to the distinctly different though equally worn faces of his subjects.
  Negative
Its a motif he will carry throughout the film, and this level of intimacy is used not for character empathy, but to disturb the viewer.
  Neutral
The members of The Club represent an institutional evil from which most people would recoil, yet the viewer is purposely kept too close for comfort.
  Negative
These are men whom well discover are not sorry for their heinous crimes, and the mere insinuation of their apathy is enough to enrage.
  Negative
But horror ultimately gives way to irritation as the film veers into violent shock tactics and misplaced blame.
  Negative
What begins as a righteous indictment devolves into an unnecessary vendetta.
  Negative
The first act of The Club is a tightly wound series of coy revelations that end in an effective, shocking act of violence.
  Negative
A beachside house in La Boca, Chile, is a retreat for priests who have been sent there for reasons easy to predict.
  Negative
The men are overseen by their jailer," a nun named Sister Mnica  Antonia Zegers whose unflappable calmness is a blatant warning sign that shes trying too hard to seem innocuous.
  Negative
The defrocked priests include the dog owner, Padre Vidal  Alfredo Castro, Padre Ramirez  Alejandro Sieveking and Padre Silva  Jaime Vadell.
  Negative
They seem content with their days of prayer and a little recreation, the latter of which includes chronic boozing and gambling on Padre Vidals talented greyhound in the local dog races.
  Negative
Into this closed system comes another priest, Padre Lazcano  Jos Soza, whose arrival reveals the reasons the priests have been exiled and isolated.
  Negative
A local fisherman namedSandokan  Roberto Faras arrives outside the compound to call on Padre Lazcano.
  Negative
Sandokan proceeds to describe, in pornographic detail, his childhood sexual abuse when he was an altar boy of Padre Lazcano.
  Negative
Im not sure if Sandokans words are some kind of personal exorcism or a subversive attempt to torture the priests by turning them on' Sandokan speaks in this explicit sexual way to the priests for most of the film, and at one point, offers to have sex with them before offering to find them young boys to molest.
  Negative
Regardless, his introductory monologue seems endless.
  Negative
Sandokans speech unnerves the priests so much that one of them sends Padre Lazcano outside with a gun to scare Sandokan away.
  Negative
Father Matias steps outside and promptly blows his own brains out.
  Neutral
The next priest to arrive at the house is not so easily rattled.
  Negative
Hes Padre Garca  Marcelo Alonso, a Jesuit priest and psychologist.
  Negative
Garca has been sent by the Vatican, presumably to close the house down because of Padre Lazcano's death.
  Negative
It is implied that his visit was planned before Padre Lazcano's arrival, so his appearance and actions carry a hint of mystery.
  Positive
Is he there to investigate the suicide, psychoanalyze the men, play avenging angel or further enforce the Churchs cover-ups?
  Negative
Garca interrogates each priest, all of whom to a fault are unwilling to confess or even consider their crimes against the children in their care.
  Negative
His conversations give the viewer ample opportunity to hate these men, all of whom never once appear to be anything but easy symbols.
  Negative
One priest kidnapped poor children and gave them to rich families, for example.
  Negative
Even SisterMnica has skeletons in her closet, though the films choice to make her the most villainous, sadistic character is one of its bigger mistakes.
  Negative
Eventually, c orruption spreads like wildfire and everyone in close proximity runs the risk of bursting into flames.
  Negative
The Club dilutes its potentially powerful message by introducing a confusing, dangerous correlation between homosexuality and pedophilia.
  Negative
It starts with homosexual Padre Vidals interrogation by Garca and reaches a rather vile nadir with a scene between Sandokan and a naked hooker who violates him anally at his request before recoiling in disgust.
  Negative
Sandokan is so poorly written that any sexual confusion he has manifests itself as self-hating homosexuality rather than uncertainty.
  Negative
The ultimate fate of the character further supports this interpretation, though I question if this was Larrans intention.
  Negative
Larran is excellent at creating worlds in microcosm and examining them his No was one of s best films.
  Positive
His IMDb article says he is not for the weak-hearted, his films are straightforward, generally aggressive and interspersed with violence.This is certainly true of The Club," but as with Tony Manero," his most well-known film, theres a beating a dead horse kind of feeling to some of that aggression.
  Negative
We get the point long before the unnecessary details designed to drag us irrevocably to the directors side.
  Negative
At least with Tony Manero, Larrans characters felt fleshed out.
  Negative
Had he really wanted to scare us in The Club," he would have made at least one priest achingly human and three-dimensional despite his terrible crimes, then forced us to stare at that repentant guy as an indicator of a much more corrupt system of evil.
  Negative
