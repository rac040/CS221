As a techie, I expected more from "Creative Control."
  Negative
The concept of people living in a near-future Brooklyn gave me serious pause, to be sure, but I thought those fears would be soothed by the sci-fi promise of technology gone awry.
  Negative
The gadget in question is a Google Glass-like pair of specs that allow you to surf the internet, text and answer your e-mails.
  Negative
If youre ambitious, they also allow an alternate reality to play out for the wearer.
  Negative
Movies like this allow us to indulge in flights of fancy: What would you do if you procured a pair of these bad boys?
  Neutral
Id love to fly.
  Positive
Or make myself a billionaire.
  Neutral
Or see out of my blind left eye again.
  Neutral
None of these things will ever occur in reality, which is why Id get good use out of the Augmenta Glasses seen in Creative Control."
  Negative
But, as is custom with these types of movies, anything fantastic is bypassed for the sole purpose of something sexual.
  Negative
And not even freaky sexual, like shape-shifting while gettin bizzy or orgasms that make your hair stand up like  Don Kings before Roman candles shoot out of your toes.
  Negative
Just plain, vanilla sex that you can get any day of the week without technology, if you have game.
  Negative
Someone in Creative Controldoeshave the kind of mind-blowing sex finish I described above, where I believe she saw angels doing the Electric Slide or something, but she used yoga to obtain her boffo finale.
  Negative
Last I checked, yoga was pretty damn analog.
  Negative
So the technology of Creative Control is a bust, which leaves me with the characters and their situations.
  Negative
None of these are original nor entertaining unless youre the type of person depicted in this movie.
  Negative
I am not, and my real-life aversion to this type of Brooklynite is why I found Creative Control insufferable.
  Very negative
I wonder if these folks, who ramble and whine about capitalism, third-world issues and first-world problems while growing large beards, man-buns and yoga bodies would even go see a movie like this one.
  Negative
Im assuming they must, because we get one of these movies practically every other week.
  Negative
Director Benjamin Dickerson plays David, friend of pervy, serial cheater photographer Wim  Dan Gill and lover of Juliette  Nora Zehetner, recipient of the aforementioned super-lucky yoga hosing.
  Negative
David is the lead on the advertising campaign for Augmenta, so he recruits  Reggie Watts as himself to use them to create performance art for the advertisements.
  Negative
Watts role is somewhat thankless he comes off as the Magical Negro that occasionally haunts the fringes of these movies but he does get a call-back of sorts to the  Grace Jones character in the far superior  Eddie Murphy vehicle, " Boomerang."
  Negative
Like Eddie in that film, David gruesomely learns the hazards of working with avant-garde brown people.
  Positive
David also starts using Augmenta to craft a purely sexual virtual reality relationship with Wims girlfriend, Sophie  Alexia Rasmussen.
  Negative
The real Sophie is somewhat available, so this seems like going about things the hard way.
  Positive
I get that Creative Control wants to make a statement about how this voluntary detachment from reality causes David and society at large to suffer both socially and mentally.
  Negative
But Davids a drunk and a drug addict before he even dons the magic shades, so he was already headed in this direction.
  Negative
Dickersons visual FX team gets some interesting mileage from the Augmenta visualizations, whose colors remain in stark contrast to the superb black and white cinematography by  Adam Newport-Berra.
  Positive
He and Dickerson use the frame in interesting ways, even if what were watching is an interminable, somewhat offensive argument about African kids getting butchered while mining the material used to make Davids product.
  Negative
Your tolerance for Creative Control will depend on your feelings toward these unlikable characters and the day-to-day things that irk them.
  Negative
For example, Wim is particularly vile but not at all unrecognizable as a typical masculine movie type.
  Negative
He sends pictures of himself having sex with his various models to best friend, David, and their male view of women harkens back to the Stone Age.
  Positive
The female characters dont fare too much better, but they are granted more agency than you might suspect.
  Negative
The final scene of Creative Control introduces an idea I wish the film had explored, the notion of how living in a big city can be poisonous, but those toxins can prove too tempting to resist.
  Negative
The ambiguous last shot, which visually brings this idea to the forefront, deserves a better movie attached to it, one that earned the full devastation of these implications.
  Very positive
If nothing else, I would have been happier with a film that did something unexpected with its technology.
  Negative
Gorgeous cinematography aside, this was a tough slog.
