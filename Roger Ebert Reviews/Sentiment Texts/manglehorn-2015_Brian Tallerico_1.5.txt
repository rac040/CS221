David Gordon Green continues to focus on character studies, as he did with  Prince Avalanche and  Joe, but the results this time are decidedly more frustrating than those superior efforts.
  Negative
Just as Joe often felt like a vehicle to rehabilitate the oft-mocked career of  Nicolas Cage in the last decade or so, Manglehorn sometimes feels designed to remind us that  Al Pacino is still one of our greatest actors.
  Positive
OK.
  Neutral
Point taken.
  Neutral
Now what?
  Neutral
While Joe built an interesting film around Cages performance, Green leaves Pacino adrift in Manglehorn, and the result is a disappointing, shambling piece of melancholy with a few interesting scenes here and there that never cohere in such a way that allows the legendary actor to disappear into the character.
  Very negative
Pacino plays an eccentric locksmith named Manglehorn who lives in a small Texas town by himself.
  Neutral
Hes estranged from his financially successful son Jacob  Chris Messina, has few real friends outside of his cat, and writes letters to the love of his life who got away many years ago.
  Positive
A highlight of his meager existence seems to be the occasional visit to the local bank to see the lovely teller Dawn  Holly Hunter, but when hes given a chance to turn that into something greater, he fumbles.
  Positive
Manglehorn has allowed anger, regret and depression to push him into isolation in his later years.
  Negative
He doesnt have much left outside of his key-making business, and that basically just gives him another reason to be alone in his shop.
  Negative
On one level,  Paul Logans script is defiantly episodic: Manglehorn talks to his son, he runs into an acquaintance played in a remarkably aggravating style by  Harmony Korine, he flirts with Holly Hunter, etc.
  Negative
While Manglehorn could have been a character study, a slice of reclusive old age in modern America, Logan and Green layer their film with poetic self-importance, mostly in Manglehorns letters and inner monologues, complete with lines like Im losing hope in tomorrow.
  Negative
It feels false, like a degree of self-understanding that only comes in motion pictures or bad fiction.
  Negative
And that dishonesty carries over to scenes between Manglehorn and his son, especially a dinner between the two thats just too poorly written for Pacino and Messina to save it.
  Negative
Every shot of Manglehorns grizzled face is weighted with unearned gravitas, the kind that comes with designing a film around an actor instead of a character or a narrative.
  Positive
It feels like the first draft was called Al Pacino is Still a Hell of an Actor.
  Negative
And that showcase is constantly pushing against the films realism.
  Positive
Theres a scene late in the film between Pacino and Hunter that really should work shes great in it in which Dawn realizes that Manglehorns enclosed life is one that she may not want to enter, but Pacino and Green cant figure out how to play the moment.
  Negative
Pacino practically climbs on a soapbox to deliver a monologue, when it should be about a man afraid and tentative to re-enter the real world of human relationships.
  Neutral
At its best, Manglehorn is a surprisingly deep conversation with an old friend on a twilight Southern evening.
  Positive
Its about those times in our lives when we reassess past mistakes and consider the diminishing hours we have left on this planet.
  Negative
I only wish the film allowed that conversation to flow naturally with a well-rounded character instead of reminding us over and over again that were talking to the one and only Al Pacino.
  Negative
