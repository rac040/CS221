In writer-directors  Zachary Cotler and Magdalena Zyzak's debut feature film "Maya Dardel," the title character is an internationally renowned poet who feels her best work is behind her.
  Positive
The three celebrated volumes she wrote in her s made her name.
  Neutral
Now, moving into the twilight of her life, posterity is on her mind.
  Positive
She has no family, no husband, no children.
  Negative
All that matters is her work.
  Positive
Self-pity is not in her makeup, one of her most startling characteristics.
  Negative
Maya Dardel is played by the great  Lena Olin, an actress of enormous power and intelligence, and her presence prickly, intimidating, unpredictable, frankly sexual is justification alone for the film's existence.
  Positive
Where "Maya Dardel" really works is when it sticks to being a character study.
  Positive
No matter what else happens and quite a bit happens, it is Olin and the questions her character provokes "Who is she?
  Neutral
What does she want?
  Neutral
Did she really just say that??"
  Neutral
that lets this film off its pretty short self-imposed leash.
  Neutral
The opening scene shows Maya, calling into an NPR radio show from her living room to calmly announce that she plans to commit suicide, but before she does she needs to appoint someone executor of her literary estate.
  Negative
She announces that any young writer interested in the gig should reach out to her agent.
  Positive
"Women need not apply," she says, and then elaborates with eviscerating bluntness: "Because I don't like women's writing."
  Negative
It's a hell of an opening.
  Negative
Maya is not emotional about committing suicide.
  Negative
She doesn't even seem particularly depressed.
  Negative
Her voice is unbroken by softness or sentimentality.
  Negative
One of the biggest traps for actors is feeling sentimental about the characters they play.
  Positive
Lena Olin has never fallen into those traps.
  Negative
It's refreshing to watch an actress not care about being liked to the degree that Olin does.
  Positive
What ensues after the call to NPR is a contest-type scenario, where she holds a series of "interviews" with the male writers interested in managing her posthumous reputation.
  Positive
Young men, accustomed to ignoring older women to the point of not seeing them at all, are tossed into a whirlpool of confusion while trapped by her predatory unforgiving gaze.
  Negative
They struggle to maintain their sense of unearned superiority.
  Neutral
It doesn't really come as a surprise when she ends each interview by demanding the candidates perform oral sex on her.
  Negative
The cunnlingus-montage that follows, showing candidate after candidate buried between her legs, is both hilarious and disturbing.
  Positive
Throughout, Maya remains self-centered, somewhat imperious, critical-thinking skills always in operation.
  Negative
It's not just that she's horny although that's part of it.
  Negative
It's more that she is looking for a man who embraces female power, who doesn't fear it.
  Positive
Cunnilingus skills or lack thereof is the perfect "tell."
  Neutral
Maya narrows down the candidates to two finalists: Ansel  Nathan Keyes and Paul  Alexander Koch.
  Negative
Ansel is so shy he can barely speak above a whisper and seems chagrined that Maya is planning on suicide.
  Negative
He wants her to re-consider.
  Positive
Paul is a horse of a different color, a little bit older, arrogant, meeting Maya on her level.
  Negative
Paul is not easy to manipulate, so it's no wonder, then, considering what we have seen of Maya, that she is drawn to him.
  Negative
The film seesaws back and forth between quiet gentle Ansel and aggressive jerk Paul, somewhat tiresomely pitting them against one another.
  Positive
There's an unbalanced effect here.
  Negative
Olin is better than the film she's in, and she dominates the other actors onscreen.
  Positive
She can't help it.
  Neutral
The scenes with her shotgun-toting off-the-grid next door neighbor  Rosanna Arquette are fantastic.
  Positive
The two women crawl into the motorboat that sits out in the middle of the woods, and drink vodka, talking about life, death, the world.
  Negative
Two cultural outlaws who have rejected the world's standards, maintaining their own course, however inexplicable to outsiders.
  Negative
These scenes have an untrammeled quality lacking in the rest of the film.
  Negative
In , American audiences were introduced to Lena Olin in Philip Kaufman's film adaptation of Milan Kundera's " The Unbearable Lightness of Being."
  Negative
In one famous scene, Olin, wearing black lacy underwear and a black derby, crawled on top of a full-length mirror lying flat on the floor, glancing up at her lover through the reflection.
  Negative
Olin was a powerful and unashamed erotic presence, spiked with intelligence, humor, knowingness.
  Very positive
She was in ownership of her sexuality, which is why she was able to be so playfully performative with it.
  Neutral
Kundera devotes pages of his book to that black derby, the sexual permission it symbolized.
  Negative
It's decades later now, and that scene still lingers like an afterimage.
  Neutral
Nominated for an Academy Award for her beautiful performance in " Enemies: A Love Story," she is probably known by a younger generation for her recurring role in "Alias."
  Positive
Most recently, she appeared in one memorable scene in David Fincher's Netflix series "Mindhunter."
  Neutral
Despite my quibbles with the structure of "Maya Dardel"'s story, its unnecessary leashing itself to the "contest" between two candidates, the film has much to recommend it, in particular its lack of sentimentality about suicide, art, womanhood.
  Positive
What are we to do with a talent as ferocious and as individual as Lena Olin?
  Neutral
Where to "put" her?
  Neutral
She's a natural star, in the most old-fashioned sense of the word.
  Positive
If the world were just, the industry would have already figured her out, would have realized that she always belongs at the center of things.
  Negative
Cotler and Zyzak are to be applauded for creating a space where Lena Olin can roam free.
  Negative
