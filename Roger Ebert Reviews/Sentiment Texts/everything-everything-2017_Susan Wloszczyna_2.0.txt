Charismatic film actors can work miracles with so-so material.
  Negative
But there usually comes a point when they can no longer camouflage that the story they are so earnestly committed to telling is somewhat suspect.
  Negative
For at least half of Everything, Everything, the latest best-selling young-adult novel to find its way to the big screen, I was content enough to simply bask in the company of -year-old  Amandla Stenberg Rue in  The Hunger Games franchise and -year-old  Nick Robinson  Jurassic World, the two attractive leads who star as Maddy and Olly in this adolescent romance.
  Negative
Blessed with bright blemish-free faces, a precociously articulate way with words as they discuss calculus and literature, knock-em-dead smiles and effusively emotive hair, this pairs presence puts a welcome sheen on an old thematic chestnut: the destiny-driven infatuation that wont be denied, even in the face of a potentially lethal disease.
  Positive
The malady in question?
  Neutral
Maddy is a bubble girl, meaning that she suffers from severe combined immunodeficiency aka SCID.
  Negative
As a result, she is allergic to the outside world and must live in an antiseptic environment complete with a stylish mostly white and certainly organic wardrobe.
  Positive
There have been bubble boys on TV  John Travolta in s The Boy in the Plastic Bubble and that sore-loser Trivial Pursuit player on Seinfeld and in movies  Jake Gyllenhaal in the  dramedy Bubble Boy.
  Negative
But a female version is a rarity and the so-called bubble in this case could pass as something out of a high-end dcor magazine for medical patients.
  Negative
The hermetically-sealed contemporary abode in Los Angeles features plenty of spacious windows so that Maddy can at least pretend she can connect to the world beyond her laptop something she hasnt been able to do in  years .
  Positive
Luckily enough, single mother Pauline  Anika Noni Rose of the film version of Dreamgirls, a Tony winner whose abilities are at half-tapped here is a caring doctor who tends to all her daughters health needs as well as a vigilant warden who makes sure she is never exposed to harmful elements.
  Negative
She is especially cautious since her husband and a son died in a car accident years ago.
  Positive
Soon after, Maddy got terribly sick and that was that.
  Negative
But then new neighbors move in and, lo, Maddy spies Olly, the super-cute skateboarder next door, who makes eye contact and waves as she peers through glass.
  Negative
In what seems to be a clever play on the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet, the love-struck pair can see into each others bedroom window and communicate by various means.
  Positive
They initially bond over silly pantomimed jokes at the expense of a misbegotten bundt cake baked by his mother and rejected by Pauline since, you know, germs.
  Negative
Then Olly writes his cell phone number on his pane, and soon they are whispering sweet text messages to one another at all hours of the night.
  Positive
There is even a kindly nurse a la Shakespeare named Carla Ana de la Reguera, who acts as their sympathetic go-between and goes so far as to let Olly into the house after he promises to keep a safe distance from Maddy fat chance.
  Negative
I like how director  Stella Meghie brings to life Maddys architectural models of a diner and a library as she imagines that her text message exchanges with Olly are face to face conversations taking place in life-size versions of her creations.
  Negative
It allows the movie to breathe.
  Positive
That an astronaut figure that inhabits her miniatures also shows up as a character is a nicely humorous and surreal touch.
  Very positive
And the matter-of-fact portrayal of a bi-racial relationship is presented just as it should be unremarked upon.
  Negative
But, at a certain point, when Maddy starts to rebel against her mothers strict rules and Ollys father becomes abusive, it is inevitable they will run away and to a beach, since that is Maddys dream.
  Negative
Think  Love Story crossed with a PG- Blue Lagoon minus the ickier stuff.
  Neutral
That is where logic begins to go askew.
  Negative
Yes, you can get a credit card at  just by signing up for one online.
  Negative
Yes, you can buy plane tickets with it on a web site.
  Negative
But how can you fly without ID since she surely doesnt have a drivers license, given her response to being in a car with Olly behind the wheel.
  Negative
Plus, you just know there will be a BIG TWIST coming eventually and, when it does, it drags everything down with it.
  Negative
Being around any young people in the throes of a blossoming crush can be a tonic, a contact-high reminder of how it feels to be so consumed by such a rush of intense feelings.
  Negative
It can also be annoying as hell, especially when they shut out the rest of humanity including those who care about them the most.
  Negative
Everything, Everything tries to have it both ways and only partially succeeds in being the right romantic medicine.
  Negative
