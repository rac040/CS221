History has a funny way of repeating itself.
  Positive
This past April,  Terry Georges The Promise was unceremoniously dumped in theaters to tepid reviews and swiftly fizzled with audiences.
  Negative
Despite having a prestigious pedigree and intentions of the utmost nobility, Georges picture fell far short of its aspirations for awards contention, making back a small fraction of its  million budget.
  Negative
The film itself wasnt bad, per se.
  Negative
It featured fine performances from stars  Oscar Isaac and  Christian Bale, while crafting a melodrama that was never less than diverting.
  Positive
What made it such a letdown was the unrealized potential of its historical backdrop.
  Negative
George had set out to shed light on the Armenian Genocide carried out by the Ottoman government, but ultimately did this atrocity a disservice by upstaging it with a hackneyed love triangle.
  Negative
A film straining to sear itself into the consciousness of viewers had rendered itself bland and forgettable.
  Negative
Now arriving in theaters only seven months later is  Joe Berlingers Intent to Destroy, a well-intentioned documentary that makes the puzzling miscalculation of upstaging the Armenian Genocide with The Promise.
  Negative
For lengthy stretches of its near-two-hour running time, Berlingers film takes the form of a self-congratulatory behind-the-scenes featurette, complete with glib talking heads and footage shot between takes on the set of Georges production.
  Negative
Several past Oscar favorites are cited as key inspirations for The Promise, including Schindlers List,  The Killing Fields, and Georges own  Hotel Rwanda, all great pictures tackling the real-life horrors of genocide.
  Negative
VFX director Mark Russell inadvertently pinpoints the primary shortcoming of The Promise by discussing the need for conveying historical events without making them repulsive, diluting the horror contained in archival images by restaging them in a more palatable style.
  Negative
The simple fact is that films about such abhorrent crimes against humanity should galvanize the senses in order to leave a lasting impact.
  Negative
Evgeny Afineevskys HBO documentary,  Cries from Syria, was unsparingly graphic in its comprehensive exploration of the Syrian Civil War that has escalated the global refugee crisis, presenting evidence of the senseless slighter in a frank manner without devolving into exploitation.
  Negative
A few of its heartrending images displaying the bodies of young casualties are glimpsed fleetingly in Intent to Destroy, as it parallels the plight of Syrians with that of Armenians from a century ago.
  Negative
Unfortunately, Berlingers film isnt nearly as laser-focused nor as wrenching as Cries from Syria, though its hardly a mess on the order of Book of Shadows: Blair Witch , the directors most perplexing work to date.
  Very negative
Intent to Destroy is at its best when it simply forgets about The Promise altogether and focuses on the history itself, which is riveting even when recounted with straightforward earnestness.
  Positive
The mass extermination of .
  Neutral
million Armenians occurred during and after WWI, providing a modern template for population control that was adopted by Germany during the Holocaust.
  Negative
The fierce nationalism voiced by the Young Turks party is frighteningly similar to that of Nazis and KKK members hellbent on eliminating an entire race of people that they deem threatening.
  Negative
Able-bodied Armenian men were rounded up and sent to labor camps while their loved ones were forced to embark on death marches into the desert.
  Negative
One survivor recalls seeing a pregnant woman punished for lagging behind by having her baby slashed out of her stomach.
  Negative
When the Republic of Turkey was established in , Mustafa Atatrk rose to power as the countrys first president, granting oil to the U.S. in exchange for their silence regarding the Armenian Genocide.
  Negative
This was a dramatic shift for the United States, which had pledged to aid Armenians only a few years prior.
  Neutral
Babe Ruth had even auctioned off one of his prized baseball bats to help support Armenian charities.
  Negative
But when MGM began pre-production on an adaptation of Franz Werfels  hit novel about the genocide, The Forty Days of Musa Dagh, the Turkish ambassador to the U.S. successfully shut down the production.
  Negative
If George had run up against similar roadblocks while shooting The Promise, the inclusion of his production footage wouldve made more sense, but aside from Turkish propaganda being mailed to one of the actors, we see no conflict in these scenes, apart from what is scripted.
  Negative
Infinitely more compelling is the extended interview with  Atom Egoyan, who details the surreal experience he had while making s  Ararat, a narrative feature about a filmmakers efforts to depict the genocide.
  Neutral
Not only did Egoyan receive enraged letters and ultimatums from Turkish officials, a book was released in the country claiming that his entire career was strategically designed as a form of cultural terrorism.
  Negative
When a distributor bravely signed on to release the film in Turkey, an ultra-nationalist group threatened to bomb any theater that would screen it, thus dooming its chances to be seen by audiences.
  Negative
Four years later, PBS chose to air Andrew Goldbergs documentary, The Armenian Genocide, while undermining its credibility with a subsequent roundtable featuring the genocides chief denier in the U.S., Justin McCarthy.
  Negative
Berlinger does manage to land an interview with McCarthy himself, though the film skims too quickly through his arguments, which all seem to deviate from the inarguable fact of the actual genocide he insists a more appropriate term would be mutual extermination.
  Positive
The notion that Armenians suffer from Holocaust envy and simply want to reclaim sections of land is appalling in the extreme.
  Very negative
Since Turkey remains a NATO ally of the U.S., the country has silenced our nations presidents throughout the ages, including  Barack Obama, who suddenly became unable to mention the genocide once he took office.
  Negative
Former U.S. ambassador  John Marshall Evans chillingly reveals how he was muzzled by Condoleezza Rice after he dared acknowledge the genocide, forcing him to issue a public apology.
  Negative
Had Berlinger abandoned The Promise in an early stage of post-production, he wouldve ended up with a more cohesive, less self-serving picture.
  Negative
As it stands, the film is a sporadically successful indictment of how U.S. policy has been synonymous with alternative facts over the last century.
  Negative
Though our current president is never mentioned by name, the term trump leaps off the screen every time it is mentioned, much like the word knife in Hitchcocks Blackmail.
  Negative
This isnt a result of the film itself, but indicative of how  Donald Trump has embodied misinformation long before he entered the presidential race.
  Negative
When tyrants control the media, an average-sized crowd can easily be doctored to resemble the largest audience to witness an inauguration, period.
  Negative
History can be rewritten, facts can be deemed fiction and the wounds of unacknowledged atrocities will be left unhealed.
  Negative
Intent to Destroy may be an imperfect film, but its still an important one.
