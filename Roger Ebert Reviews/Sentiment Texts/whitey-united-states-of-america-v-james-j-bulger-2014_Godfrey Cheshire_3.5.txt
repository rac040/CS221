Most films focusing on criminal trials aim at revealing the accuseds guilt or innocence.
  Neutral
In  Joe Berlingers "Whitey: United States of America V. James J. Bulger," however, theres no doubt that Boston crime lord James "Whitey" Bulger was a very bad guy with tons of criminal misdeeds including murders to his discredit, and those who followed his  trial will know he was convicted of a number of these and sentenced to spend the rest of his life behind bars.
  Negative
The real question of culpability that provides an element of suspense here, ironically, concerns not the obvious baddies but the ostensible good guys: How much of Whiteys career was facilitated and furthered by corrupt government figures, especially ones in the FBI and U.S. department of justice?
  Positive
Whitey, after all, ran the Irish mob in Boston for nearly  years without a single arrest, even a misdemeanor.
  Negative
He was apprehended in California in  after fleeing his native state and living for years under false identities.
  Negative
How did he get away with it?
  Neutral
Pretty much everyone concedes some level of official corruption and complicity, but the issue is what he did to get it.
  Negative
In his trial, Whitey admits to bribing often with lavish cash Christmas "presents" pretty much every officer of the law he came into contact with.
  Positive
But some maintain that he gave the lawmen something else as well: information.
  Neutral
Was Whitey an informant?
  Neutral
Strange that such activity is not criminal and thus is nowhere mentioned in the counts against Bulger, yet it becomes a central issue in the trial, the defense vigorously denying it and the prosecution everywhere asserting and implying it.
  Very negative
That, it appears, is because both sides assume that Whitey will be convicted of most of the charges and then locked away forever.
  Negative
The real issue of contention, then, is reputation' or to use the term of choice, "legacy."
  Negative
If Whitey ratted out his fellows, he is the lowest of the low, a man without honor anywhere in the universe.
  Negative
If, on the other hand, this is all a smear, then he can still portray himself as a "good bad guy" and hold his head up in the criminal underworld.
  Negative
A similar concern is attached to only one other issue: whether he killed two women with his bare hands, no less.
  Negative
Good bad guys dont murder the fairer sex, so Whiteys defense team takes pains to deflect the charge onto other miscreants.
  Negative
In centering his film on the trial, Berlinger commendably finds a new angle on Bulger, one of the most storied of modern criminals.
  Positive
Scorseses " The Departed" fictionalized his exploits, and there are reportedly two big movies about him in the works now, one starring  Johnny Depp, the other mounted by  Ben Affleck and  Matt Damon.
  Negative
But of course, covering the trial is also a prism for looking at Whiteys whole bloody career and a history of criminals-versus-crimefighters in which the moral lines were often fatally blurred.
  Negative
Berlinger takes the story all the way back to attorney general Robert F. Kennedys exposing the Italian Mafia "la cosa nostra", something FBI director J. Edgar Hoover had long denied.
  Negative
The result was that the feds began to focus on Italian organized crime, to the advantage of other kinds.
  Negative
When he came out of prison after a youthful sentence for bank robbery, Whitey offered himself as a middle man between competing criminal factions, which, along with his nerve and ruthlessness, led to his ascendancy as a new kind of crime boss.
  Negative
He also later claimed that protecting federal prosecutor Jeremiah OSullivan from revenge by the Italian mobsters, not informing, was what gained him the governments protection.
  Negative
The judge didnt allow this claim into evidence.
  Neutral
With no cameras allowed in the courtroom, Berlinger has to rely on artists renderings and readings of the testimony, with significant statements typed across the screen.
  Negative
Outside the court, he gets interviews with most of the main players.
  Positive
Three prosecutors insisted on being interviewed together why?
  Negative
and though this feels a little stilted, their words are forceful.
  Neutral
Attorney Jay Carney and others on the Bulger team, in contrast, are loose, nimble and eager to share their evidence against the informant charge.
  Negative
And surely best of all from Berlingers standpoint, Carney delivers Whitey himself at least aurally.
  Positive
Speaking from prison through his lawyers phone, the arch-criminal sounds intelligent, level-headed and passionate to maintain his "good bad guy" reputation.
  Positive
Naturally, his opponents say the image he creates is a total fraud, and that his capacity for lying knows no bounds.
  Negative
Which may be true.
  Neutral
With Whitey declining to take the stand his lawyer says he wasnt allowed to testify and his sentence forbidding him to give interviews from prison, this may be the only direct testimony well ever get from the man, and its worth hearing to get a sense of his focused, self-exculpatory outlook.
  Negative
Apart from the defense and prosecution, Berlinger takes his verite camera outside and spends time with the families of Whiteys victims he was charged with  murders, many very brutal.
  Negative
These are the films most moving sections and the filmmaker handles them with both sensitivity and tact.
  Very positive
Understandably, many of these ordinary Bostonians some of whose loved ones just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time have harbored a fierce hatred of Whitey and desire for justice to be meted out to him at long last.
  Negative
Yet while most of this comes to pass, many of them remain frustrated because theyd wanted something else too: the governments role in his misdeeds to be fully aired and documented.
  Negative
While we get to see many of Whiteys former cohorts ratting on each other truthfully or not to earn leniency, and some of the guilty among the FBI and the department of justice are named, the evidence suggests that only corruption on a large, systemic scale could have sheltered a criminal as massively guilty as Whitey for decades, and the trial doesnt end up painting a clear picture of this.
  Negative
A masterful documentarian "Brothers Keeper," "Paradise Lost", Berlinger has been criticized for not making that picture clearer himself, as well as for not favoring the evidence that Whitey was indeed an informant.
  Positive
But surely the great value of this fascinating, expertly crafted film is to leave us with the sense that, Whitey apart, justice has not been done as long as official corruption this wide and deep has not been rooted out and fully understood.
  Negative
