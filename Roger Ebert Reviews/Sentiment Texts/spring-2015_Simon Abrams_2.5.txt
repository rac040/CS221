"Spring," an ambitious and often enchanting genre hybrid, is at its best when it's a straight-forward romance.
  Very positive
Which is a shame since elements of supernatural horror eventually intrude, and become too prominent to ignore.
  Negative
At that point, the film sacrifices its charming sense of immediacy and warmth, and becomes far more blunt and convoluted than it needs to be.
  Positive
Tone is everything in "Spring," a " Before Sunset"-esque drama whose amiably rambling plot mimics its love-lorn protagonist's journey.
  Negative
Awkward but earnest American Evan " Thumbsucker" star  Lou Taylor Pucci flees to Italy after his mother dies, and stumbles into a love affair with mysterious local Louise  Nadia Hilker.
  Negative
The process of discovery that Evan goes through to get closer to Louise is what makes "Spring" special.
  Positive
But what Evan discovers about Louise feels like an after-thought that frustratingly overwhelms the film once it gets to where it's going.
  Negative
"Spring" is arguably a character study since Louise's transformation from mystery fling to serious partner marks Evan's greatest metamorphosis.
  Positive
And that's ok.
  Positive
The film's main strength is its zen-like calm, an atmosphere of non-judgmental acceptance that gets thrown out of whack once Louise's secrets are revealed.
  Negative
We follow Evan as he blithely   though partly out of shock flees first to tourist-y Rome, then picturesque Puglia.
  Negative
He dithers around with some obnoxious but sympathetic British dude-bros.
  Negative
Then he takes a live-in job working with eccentric farmer Angelo  Francesco Carnelutti, who serves as Angelo's grandfatherly moral compass.
  Neutral
Then Evan stumbles into Louise, and "Spring" starts to drift into darker territory.
  Negative
Louise and Evan's relationship is the real reason you should see "Spring."
  Neutral
Their respective quirks make them natural foils: he's a slightly-uptight, definitely-naive angry young man, and she's a disarmingly outspoken, but ultimately stand-offish femme fatale.
  Very negative
Both characters consciously resist their respective limitations, which makes for great, naturalistic conversations.
  Negative
Take for example their first meeting: Evan blusters his way through this awkward encounter, asking Louise if she only wants to have sex with him because she's a prostitute.
  Negative
It's a suspicion that's mirrored later in the film when an obnoxious American tourist assumes he can pay Louise for sex.
  Negative
Evan's not just like this boorish fellow ex-patriate, but he also kind of is.
  Neutral
The fact that Evan can't help himself from repeatedly joking that Louise may be a lady of the night what an introduction!
  Positive
says a lot about "Spring."
  Neutral
It's a film about seeing a character undergo radical growth that isn't necessarily progress, and about the evolution of a relationship whose logical conclusion isn't particularly logical or conclusive.
  Negative
At the same time, the film's lighter-than-air charms dissipate whenever the film's creators treat Louise like a girl-shaped mystery box.
  Negative
Writer  Justin Benson and co-director Aaron Moorehead treat scenes where Louise futzes with a mysterious syringe with gravity.
  Positive
But they delight in disorienting viewers with camera effects, and brief, elliptically-edited sequences that tease viewers with information about Louise's affliction.
  Negative
These scenes are supposed to feel like pockets of memory that dissipate after they rise to the film's surface.
  Negative
To that end, Benson and Moorehead succeed.
  Negative
But the deliberately vague nature of these scenes becomes upsetting once Louise is forced to explain to Evan what's wrong with her, thereby putting her skittishly vamp-y behavior into perspective.
  Negative
I'm of two minds about the scene where Louise tells Evan about her past.
  Negative
It's a wonderfully-shot, and well-choreographed scene: the two characters wander warmly-lit cobble-stone streets, turning corners at an unhurried pace.
  Negative
And they talk.
  Positive
He asks necessary questions, and she answers them in her own words.
  Positive
The scene feels natural, and true to life.
  Positive
Until you pay attention to what Louise is saying.
  Neutral
The longer she talks in this scene, the less convincing Louise and Evan's relationship seems.
  Negative
It pushes "Spring" into the realm of literal-minded allegory, and almost ruins a sweet little story about a young man looking for someone he can devote himself to.
  Negative
Note I said "almost."
  Negative
"Spring" has a lot to offer, particularly its relaxed ambiance, and seductively assured pacing.
  Positive
If Evan's story didn't have to wrap up, "Spring" would probably be a much better film.
  Negative
This is, after all, a movie where two star-crossed lovers kiss for the first time after he tells a shaggy dog joke, then blithely admits that he only told his would-be conquest a tall tale, "it's just a funny story."
  Negative
The film loses that tranquil quality, and winds up double-downing on its main theme: adapt to life's more daunting wrinkles, or miss out.
  Negative
But "Spring" is worth seeing for scenes where Pucci and Hilker communicate with each other, looking for some sign of reciprocal change, some hint that there's more to their mutual attraction than chemistry and dumb luck.
  Negative
They find the answers they're looking for, even if their creators sometimes take that for granted.
  Negative
