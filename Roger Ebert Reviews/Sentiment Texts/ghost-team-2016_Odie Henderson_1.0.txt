Based on the brief synopsis I received, GhostTeam sounded like a horror-comedy about a bunch ofghost-chasing misfits played by familiar names like Napolean Dynamites  Jon Heder.
  Negative
At best, I thought it would be a New World Pictures-style knock-off of Ghostbusters' at worst, I thought it would be an Empire Pictures-style knock-off of "Ghostbusters."
  Negative
I was fine with either outcome, because you know I love trash.
  Negative
But GhostTeam is neither scary nor funny.
  Negative
The closest it comes to a legitimate scare is a sing-along set to Gary Wrights "Dream Weaver," and the only hearty laugh is courtesy of  Amy Sedaris Miss Cleo-inspired telephone psychic.
  Negative
You have to wait  minutes for it, but its there.
  Negative
Theghostteam is a motley crew selected by paranormal enthusiast Louis Jon Heder.
  Negative
Louis owns a print shop where he spends his days printing numerous copies of lost pet notices.
  Negative
When his favorite show, "GhostGetters," starts a contest looking for a newghosthunter, Louis believes he can find visual evidence of the paranormal, which he can submit as his contest entry.
  Negative
To assist him on his quest, Louis creates his own version of the GhostGetters team, which includes a techie, a co-leader, a researcher, a security person and a clairvoyant.
  Negative
To fill these positions, Louis chooses: His buddy, Stan  David Krumholtz, who sleeps in a car and thinks his fiance was abducted by aliens on their wedding day' his nephew Zak  Paul W. Downs, who works in a Micro Center' Micro Centers overzealous rent-a-cop, Ross  Justin Long' psychic Victoria Amy Sedaris and Ellie  Melonie Diaz, the beauty salon worker who works next door to Louis shop.
  Negative
You can figure out who does what job on your own.
  Neutral
Trust me, it wont matter.
  Negative
Louis assembles this team after an old man asks him to print and laminate several No Trespassing signs.
  Negative
The old man yammers on about the property he wants to protect, piquing Louis interest only when he says it might be haunted.
  Negative
Armed with the address which we dont know how he got, Louis and theGhostTeam travel there with all sorts of stolen equipment from Micro Center.
  Negative
This is the moment when GhostTeam turns into a feature-length episode of the original  Scooby-Doo cartoon, complete with its characters running past the same background scenery over and over.
  Negative
If you have seen Scooby-Doo in any of its animated incarnations, you dont need to see GhostTeam."
  Negative
Its characters map to their cartoon counterparts rather nicely: Louis and Ellie are Fred and Daphne, Zak is Velma, Stan is Shaggy, Victoria is Scooby-Doo, and the obnoxious Ross is Scrappy-Doo.
  Positive
While trying to catch the "ghosts," the team members split up and get into mysterious troubles of their own.
  Negative
Theres even a villain whose ties to the ghostlyhappenings not only mask a more sinister plan, but so help me, God, he would have gotten away with it if it werent for those meddling kids and their psychic.
  Negative
Theghostteam even shows up to the mystery on our hands in an oddly-colored van.
  Positive
Im making this sound better than it is, especially for Hanna-Barbera fans.
  Positive
But if youre expecting  The Haunting or "Ghostbusters," or TheGhostBreakers or hell,ghostsin general, youll be sorely disappointed with this film.
  Negative
It takes too long for the team to startghosthunting, and screenwriter  Peter Warren tips us off to whats causing the paranormal activity way too early.
  Negative
What we are left with are these one-note characters, whose minor, sad-sack first-world problems arent worth any audience empathy whatsoever.
  Negative
Additionally, each actor coasts by on the remnants of character types theyve played in other, occasionally better movies.
  Negative
Only Melonie Diaz and Sedaris manage to leave any lasting impression, fleeting though it may be.
  Negative
Diaz brings a chipper spunk to her beautician role, which is best employed in a scene where she shuts down Heders attempt to get her alone on theghosthunt.
  Neutral
And Sedaris cynical disbelief that anybody would take her fake psychic seriously is a metaphor for the viewers reaction to "GhostTeam."
  Negative
Together, the ladies earn one half of the one star this movie deserves.
  Negative
The other half-star is for  Joe Hastings enjoyable horror movie type score.
  Positive
Its all goofy stingers and ominous foreboding.
  Neutral
You want to watch the movie it should be underscoring.
  Neutral
Might I suggest this music accompany documentary footage of the cast cashing the checks they too easily earned for their work here?
  Neutral
It would be far more compelling than GhostTeam.
  Negative
Funnier and scarier, too.
  Negative
