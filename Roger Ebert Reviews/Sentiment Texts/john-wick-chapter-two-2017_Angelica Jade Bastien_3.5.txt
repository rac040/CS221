Have you ever walked out of a film so struck by awe and wonder your skin is abuzz?
  Negative
Has a film ever left you so joyful and drunk on adrenaline that it made you more hopeful about the world?
  Positive
Has a lead performance in an action film ever had such balletic grace it made you marvel at the possibilities of the human body itself?
  Positive
This is exactly how I felt watching John Wick: Chapter Two, the sequel to the surprising  action hit.
  Negative
John Wick: Chapter Two is a more audacious film, bolder and more violent than its predecessor.
  Negative
Its also surprisingly hilarious, wringing humor from physical pratfalls and dry wit in unexpected moments.
  Very positive
In many ways, its the platonic ideal of an action film: operatic yet colored with fine-tuned details, blisteringly visceral yet tinged with pathos.
  Positive
For all its great craft, the movie is ultimately a showcase for  Keanu Reeves, who returns as the titular assassin, proving his greatness as an actor and action star.
  Positive
Yes, thats right, I said greatness.
  Positive
No qualifiers necessary.
  Neutral
John Wick: Chapter Two is truly wondrous, but it wouldnt work without Reeves, who has a sincere love of this genre.
  Positive
Wick is not good at retiring.
  Negative
Its easy to believe, as commented on by others in the film, that hes addicted to the vengeance he dishes out with such panache.
  Positive
After all, what else does he have to live for?
  Neutral
The sequel picks up shortly after the end of the first film' Wick is still reeling from the death of his wife, Helen  Bridget Moynahan, failing to adjust to a new life even with his adorable, unnamed pitbull steadfastly by his side.
  Negative
For those wondering, the dog remains safe.
  Negative
He has little time to relax when he finds Santino DAntonio  Riccardo Scamarcio on his doorstep, asking him to make good on the blood oath he made years prior that allowed him to retire from his deadly profession.
  Negative
At first, Wick balks.
  Negative
One devastating house explosion later, he sees no other choice.
  Negative
But accepting Santinos offer does not bring Wick the peace he desires so intensely.
  Negative
Soon, he finds himself facing threats from all sides, including Santinos mute enforcer Ares  Ruby Rose and Cassian Common, a bodyguard of the woman Wick is forced to kill.
  Negative
John Wick: Chapter Two is never as singularly focused as its stellar opening, which is pretty much the best Batman sequence that never was.
  Negative
Wick has already avenged his dog and now wants to recover the car stolen in the previous film.
  Negative
This gives us a fun  Peter Stormare cameo as Abram Tarasov, the brother of the Russian gangster Wick killed the last time around.
  Positive
The opening juxtaposes Wick fluidly moving in and out of shadow killing all manner of men who stand in his path.
  Negative
All the while, Abram listens to the ricocheting bullets and belabored screams of his henchmen growing almost cartoonishly overwrought with dread.
  Negative
The scene works by leaning into Wicks mythic nature even more heavily than the first film and establishes the sequels excellent comedic stylings.
  Positive
After the opening, the film wastes no time plunging us deeper into the mythology of Wicks labyrinthine world of assassins, blood oaths and arcane rules.
  Negative
The budding franchise has some of the best world-building currently in film, besting comic properties and reboots that have decades of material from which to draw.
  Positive
There are many delectable details introduced like an old-fashioned steno pool of tattooed darlings that handle the release of hits and other nasty work needing to be done.
  Negative
Some of the most fun moments are just watching Wick prepare.
  Negative
Hes a man of extremely refined taste, whether hes getting a new suit tailored or conversing with The Sommelier  Peter Serafinowicz about weaponry with the metaphors of fine dining.
  Positive
Cinema was created so Keanu Reeves could wear a fine black suit and slice through people with the same grace as  Fred Astaire.
  Positive
But in expanding Wicks world the film often lacks the sharp focus that made the original so entrancing.
  Negative
But even though it isnt a perfect sequel, the imperfections are charming, lending the story the ability to venture down fun avenues.
  Positive
John Wick: Chapter Two is a character actors paradise.
  Negative
Its so obvious that returning cast members and new faces are having fun that you cant help but smile:  Ian McShane returns to make a meal out of every scene hes in as Winston, the owner of New York Citys Continental hotel'  Lance Reddick and  John Leguizamo are also a pleasure, giving completely different energy to the film' Ruby Rose might just have a great career soon as an action star.
  Positive
With not a single line of dialogue, she has a commanding presence, proving me wrong about her skills demonstrated in a previous season of Orange is the New Black.
  Negative
Common proves to also be a great foil for Reeves, nailing the silent but deadly assassin mode with panache.
  Positive
Franco Neros brief appearance as the manager of the Continental hotel in Rome is especially great.
  Positive
Come on.
  Neutral
Its Franco Nero talking to John Wick.
  Neutral
What else could you ask for?
  Neutral
But its  Laurence Fishburne as the Bowery King that may just be my favorite addition to this fascinating world.
  Positive
The Matrix co-stars understandably have great rapport.
  Neutral
They riff off each other in the way only actors with deeply shared history can.
  Negative
Fishburnes presence is commanding, with a tinge of eccentricity.
  Very positive
His booming laughter happens to be one of the most powerful aspects of the films impressive arsenal.
  Positive
At one point, his laugh acts as a transition between scenes going longer than expected in response to Wicks questionable request.
  Negative
He only appears briefly but he makes quite an impact.
  Neutral
Of course, the reason to truly cherish John Wick: Chapter Two is the action.
  Negative
Director  Chad Stahelski and cinematographer  Dan Laustsen make every frame a sumptuous visual feast.
  Positive
They take advantage of the outsized world theyve created, forming a color palette unique to the action film landscape that gives John Wick: Chapter Two a painterly quality.
  Very positive
They also know how good-looking and physically expressive their leading man is.
  Positive
Often Reeves is the only thing on-screen, his face and body cast in shades of turquoise, jade, and neon pink.
  Negative
There is an artistry and detail to even minor scenes of characters trading barbs that express the sheer mythic and grand nature of the story.
  Positive
The sound design highlighting the crunch of bones, splatter of blood, and the various repercussions of these increasingly intense battles is also quite artful.
  Positive
Fight scenes are never over-edited, opting for continuous wide shots, making it evident how much Reeves trained.
  Negative
The violence is never one-note, running the gamut from darkly humorous to oddly poetic.
  Negative
And it is always very, very bloody.
  Negative
This film is far more brutal than the first.
  Negative
Assassins are sliced at the groin, stabbed in the thigh, and shot in all manner of body parts with the camera never flinching, forcing us to bear witness.
  Negative
Bonus: we get to see Wicks pencil trick.
  Negative
Its even more gruesome than I imagined.
  Negative
But the action isnt just intense and gorgeously crafted.
  Positive
In John Wick: Chapter Two physicality is identity.
  Negative
Screenwriter  Derek Kolstad smartly doesnt over-explain the history between characters the way they fight speaks for them.
  Positive
When Ares gets her showdown with Wick, shes scrappy and unhinged, like a starved lioness released onto an unsuspecting public.
  Negative
Cassian is more openly brutal and forceful.
  Negative
Hes more simplistic than Wick in his fighting choices but nearly as deadly.
  Negative
Their fight scenes often begin with long pauses and intense stares before giving way to outright mayhem.
  Positive
Then, of course, there is Reeves.
  Neutral
No action star quite understands how physicality can communicate story like he does.
  Positive
His dialogue may be spare.
  Neutral
But his body tells an entire story all its own, even in subdued moments.
  Positive
A glare or half-hearted smile communicates more history than many actors do with a monologue.
  Positive
Where Ares is energetic and Cassius is brutal, Reeves makes Wick elegant in his violence.
  Positive
Interestingly, Wick often does a sort of flip, locking an opponent between his legs.
  Negative
Its a move that is typically the domain of female action stars, reminding me of Black Widows signature move in films like Captain America: Winter Soldier.
  Positive
This demonstrates how Reeves uniquely blends typically feminine and masculine traits with aplomb.
  Positive
During the films most memorable fight scenes, Reeves seems like hes creating dance crafted with punches and gun-fu.
  Negative
He effectively marries the cool grace of Fred Astaire with the sex appeal of  Gene Kelly.
  Positive
No modern action star is so brutal and beautiful an equal measure.
  Positive
But Reeves goes beyond being a talented physical performer in action scenes.
  Negative
The film highlights the thematic preoccupation that snakes through his entire career: loneliness.
  Neutral
Reeves has always been best when playing men isolated due to equal parts choice and pathology.
  Positive
Wicks struggle to find peace and his place in the world is surprisingly moving.
  Very positive
Here is a man without any home in the world emotional or tangible.
  Neutral
Amid the high body count and clever design, John Wick: Chapter Two is a moving portrait of how loneliness warps the best of us.
  Positive
It ends with room for a third chapter, which I am definitely hoping for, since John Wick: Chapter Two demonstrates what film as an art form is all about: it awes and delights, challenges and provokes.
  Positive
It also proves that Keanu Reeves is the greatest modern action star and film is better for his return.
  Very positive
