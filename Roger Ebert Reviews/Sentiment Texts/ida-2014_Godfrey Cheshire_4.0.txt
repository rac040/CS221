Debuted earlier this year at Lincoln Center and now on a national tour, the -film series "Masterpieces of Polish Cinema" bears stunning testament to the brilliance of not only one especially fecund national cinema but an entire era of moviemaking call it the golden age of the art film.
  Positive
As  Martin Scorsese, who curated the series and whose Film Foundation provided its pristine digital restorations, has remarked, the period it covers roughly the s through the s was one of extraordinary accomplishments in many parts of the cinematic world, a high-water mark that grows ever more dazzling in retrospect.
  Positive
Set in the Poland of  and composed of austerely gorgeous black and white images,  Pawel Pawlikowskis "Ida" could fit right into the "Masterpieces" series, evoking as it does films ranging from  Andrzej Wajdas "Innocent Sorcerers" to Jerzy Kawalerowiczs "Mother Joan of the Angels" both .
  Positive
But thats not to suggest its a throwback or an exercise in cinematic nostalgia.
  Negative
Riveting, original and breathtakingly accomplished on every level, "Ida" would be a masterpiece in any era, in any country.
  Very positive
Somewhat ironically, director and co-writer Pawlikowski cant be considered a Polish filmmaker in any strict sense.
  Positive
Though born in Poland, he grew up in Great Britain and has done most of his work there his previous films include " My Summer of Love" and " Last Resort".
  Positive
"Ida" represents a return home for the filmmaker, one that he has said draws on the memories, sights and sounds of his childhood.
  Positive
That retrospective, and somewhat impressionistic, viewpoint mirrors the films own.
  Negative
Though set in the 's, the era of Communist rule and modernization, the story scripted by Pawlikowski and  Rebecca Lenkiewicz looks backward in time.
  Negative
Given that it starts out in a convent that seems like it hasnt changed since the Middle Ages, you might say that the films perspective suggests a vast expanse of Polish history.
  Negative
But its main focus is closer to hand: the countrys occupation by the Nazis a historical passage that is resonantly evoked but never seen or directly referred to.
  Negative
Anna Agata Trzebokowska is an -year-old orphan who was raised in that convent and is preparing to take her vows when her Mother Superior insists that first she meet her one known relative.
  Negative
That is an aunt, Wanda Agneta Kulesza, a former prosecutor with a high Communist Party rank whose dissolute life of smoking, drinking and bedding men stands in stark contrast to the ascetic existence of her sheltered niece.
  Very negative
But Anna has more to be shocked about when Wanda tells her that her real name is Ida pronounced Eeda, that she is Jewish and that her parents were killed during World War II.
  Positive
This revelation triggers a journey in which aunt and niece drive back to the village of Annas parents in an effort to discover how they died and where they were buried.
  Negative
Although this quest is central to the narrative, "Ida" is anything but plot-driven.
  Negative
Its a film of moments, observations and moods, with a lyrical unfolding that recalls such atmospheric monochrome road movies as  Wim Wenders "Kings of the Road."
  Negative
And when the two voyagers pick up a hitchhiking tenor saxophonist  Dawid Ogrodnik and end up watching his gigs, the music of  John Coltrane and similar artists adds an engrossing aural dimension to the odyssey.
  Positive
Few recent films can claim a visual approach as striking as that which cinematographers  Lukasz Zal and  Ryszard Lenczewski give "Ida."
  Negative
Filmed in the unusual, boxy aspect ratio of .
  Negative
:, and most often deployed in static long shots, the films images sometimes suggest Vermeer lighting with the color taken away, and the compositions manage to seem at once classical and off-handed, with the subjects often located in the screens two bottom quadrants.
  Negative
As in Bresson, the effect is to draw the viewers eye into the beauty of the image while simultaneously maintaining a contemplative distance from the drama.
  Positive
Pawlikoski and Lenkiewiczs scripting proves similarly lapidarian.
  Positive
Besides its look, "Ida" most recalls the manner of bygone art films in the modernist spareness and thoroughgoing obliqueness of its writing.
  Negative
Very little is stated directly' instead, we glean things from casual remarks and subtle suggestions.
  Negative
Somehow, this technique of inference makes the films eventual revelations feel both more integral and more powerful.
  Positive
Because revelations do come, despite the quests languorous rhythms, and they touch on arguably the darkest and most troubling chapter in modern Polands history.
  Negative
What happened to Annas parents?
  Neutral
Most films that approach this horrific arena envision jackbooted armies and vast industrial execution sites.
  Negative
But in Poland in the 's, as in Cambodia in the 's and Rwanda in the 's, evils authors could be ones friends and neighbors, and simple farm implements its instruments.
  Negative
In touching on this reality, "Ida" adds something to a subject that sometimes seems to have lost the ability to disturb us as it should in movies.
  Positive
Besides this historical acuity, the film gives us a fascinating pair of matched archetypes in its main characters, which are realized in two exquisite performances.
  Positive
As the aspiring nun whos suddenly tossed into the ugliness of the world, newcomer Agata Trzebokowska proves a poised icon of luminous quietude and awakened curiosity, discovering herself as she painfully uncovers her past.
  Negative
And as the embittered, nihilistic Red Wanda, a woman driven both by the horrors inflicted on her and those shes inflicted on others, veteran Polish actress Agneta Kulesza creates the astonishing impression that some of historys most wrenching conflicts are being played out in a single human soul.
  Negative
Like much about "Ida," these actresses work not only pays homage to masterpieces of the past but revivifies current cinema in doing so.
  Negative
