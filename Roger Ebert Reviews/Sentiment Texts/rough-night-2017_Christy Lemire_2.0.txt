Dying is easy, comedy is hard, as the saying goes.
  Negative
A comedy in which someone dies specifically, a male stripper at a bachelorette party that goes horribly wrong is an especially tricky feat that Rough Night never quite pulls off, despite a few glimmers of greatness and a game cast.
  Very negative
Director and co-writer  Lucia Aniello aims high in going low-brow with her first feature' shes best known for writing and directing episodes of the awesomely inappropriate TV series Broad City.
  Negative
But she has trouble making difficult tonal shifts between raunchy humor, serious drama, slapsticky action and feel-good heart.
  Negative
Rough Night starts out buoyantly, and it and features some wonderfully weird moments scattered throughout.
  Positive
But those scenes never truly gel with the movies eventual life-or-death stakes.
  Positive
By the time things get real, its difficult to care about whether these characters survive because theyre so thinly drawn.
  Negative
The ambition is also clear, though, as is the caliber of talent Aniello has amassed for her ensemble cast.
  Positive
Its certainly taken long enough but its exciting to see a rare, R-rated comedy with a woman at the helm and a strong, female cast.
  Positive
Scarlett Johansson,  Jillian Bell,  Ilana Glazer,  Zoe Kravitz and  Kate McKinnon are down for whatever and they bring an appealing, eclectic mix of energy to the screen.
  Negative
If only they had more to do than flail from one wacky scenario to the next.
  Neutral
The script from Aniello and  Paul W. Downs her longtime creative and romantic partner, who also has a supporting role as Johanssons fianc feels like its composed of bits of other raucous films from  The Hangover to Weekend at Bernies, even as it aims to be more than just a female version of a specific type of male-centric comedy.
  Negative
In between the wild set pieces, the pacing drags as the ladies struggle to rekindle their lost friendship.
  Negative
Rough Night starts strong, though, in  with a glimpse of the crazy, booze-infused connection that bound these women in college.
  Positive
A decade later, Johanssons Jess is running for state senate and is about to get married to the kind and patient Peter Downs.
  Negative
The party has been over for a while, it seems, as evidenced by her conservative clothes and awful ad campaign.
  Negative
Johansson is so naturally engaging, though, she finds a way to bring her smarts and timing to an unusually ordinary role.
  Positive
But Jess best friend, Alice Bell, insists on reliving their glory days with a bachelorette party for the ages.
  Positive
She gathers up their former freshman dorm mates Frankie Broad City star Glazer and Blair Kravitz and they all descend on Miami for a weekend of debauchery, complete with a wide variety of penis-shaped gag gifts.
  Negative
If theres one thing Rough Night gets right, its the uncomfortable, forced fun that exists within the contrived bachelorette-party setting.
  Negative
But Jess also invites along a close friend from her summer abroad in Australia: McKinnons Pippa, whom the jealous Alice insists on calling Kiwi.
  Negative
While fellow comedians Bell and Glazer have made their names going to strange and inspired places, McKinnon is as always the irresistible scene-stealer of the bunch, with her intentionally terrible Aussie accent and a fearless physicality.
  Positive
And yet, all these talented actresses can only do so much with whats on the page.
  Negative
Pippa is the New Agey flake.
  Neutral
Jess is the responsible leader.
  Negative
Alice is the needy attention seeker.
  Neutral
Glazer and Kravitz are afforded even less characterization: Frankie is a tough-talking activist and Blair is  wealthy?
  Negative
High maintenance?
  Neutral
Were told that a tension simmers between the two because theyre estranged lovers, but we never really feel it.
  Negative
Whatever awkwardness existed between all these women at the start quickly dissipates over a long, wild night punctuated by fruity cocktails and bumps of cocaine.
  Negative
And things were weird before they even left their sprawling, modern rental house when they met their next-door neighbors, a swinger couple played with skeevy specificity by  Ty Burrell and  Demi Moore.
  Negative
They quickly get yanked from their buzz, though, when they hire a stripper on Craigslist  Ryan Cooper and  accidentally kill him.
  Negative
And it really is a record scratch from which the film as a whole never recovers, despite the ladies many zany attempts to hide the body.
  Negative
Its not that the death itself is shocking.
  Negative
Its that trying to mine that death for dark humor while simultaneously acknowledging its gravity makes for a muddled tonal mix.
  Negative
In the middle of their feeble efforts to cover up their crime which, naturally, only get them into deeper trouble Jess and her friends stop everything to sit around the living room and rehash their resentments of years past.
  Negative
Aniello has said that  The Big Chill was one of her main inspirations in making Rough Night, and you can kinda see that in these scenes.
  Positive
But because we barely know these characters and they barely know each other anymore such supposedly emotional moments carry little heft.
  Negative
Similarly, the warm and affirming way the film wraps up feels tacked-on and unearned.
  Positive
A dead man is at the center of Rough Night, but the women forced to deal with him never feel truly alive.
  Negative
