Near the end of the gentle, affecting film that bears her name, Fatima played by newcomer  Soria Zeroual reads a bit of poetry she's composed to her oldest daughter, Nesrine in Arabic, because she's still learning French.
  Positive
The poem is about her life, about facing the world alone with her daughters.
  Positive
This is my intifada, she says: her act of uprising.
  Negative
Raising her daughters is her rebellion against oppression.
  Neutral
Fatimais a modest but engrossing movie, clocking in at a slim  minutes, that explores what that sort of act of rebellion might look like for a woman like Fatima: a North African immigrant in her mid-forties, divorced, living in Lyon, in a community that doesn't seem overly eager to assimilate her or women like her.
  Positive
As such, it combines several currents running through contemporary European cinema: the sticky matter of immigration and assimilation, the challenges faced by the working class, and the tricky matters women navigate when they're members of both of those groups.
  Negative
Fatima works as a cleaner, tries to learn to read and write French beyond a basic level, and raises her two daughters.
  Positive
Nesrine  Zita Hanrot, her eldest, is a first-year medical student far more mature than her  years' Souad Kenza Noah Ache, on the other hand, is , surly and disdainful of her mother's job and her broken French.
  Negative
All of them face pressure from the immigrant community, who sees Nesrine as stuck-up and Souad as a reflection on Fatima.
  Neutral
The film which screened in Director's Fortnight at Cannes in  mostly sticks to the women's stories, though the girls' father Chawki Amari is still in touch with their lives.
  Positive
Fatima brings food to Nesrine and encourages her to study hard, but also to make room in her life for love.
  Positive
Nesrine stretches herself to the breaking point with her studies.
  Neutral
Souad plays hooky and fights with her mother.
  Negative
Fatima's poetry and reflections from her diary, quoted throughout the film, come from a collection of writing by  Fatima Elayoubi, a North African immigrant woman with a similar life to her on-screen counterpart.
  Positive
In some films, a device like this comes off as heavy-handed watching people write is about the dullest thing that happens in movies' here, though, it's something much more moving.
  Negative
Fatima is not much for complaining, and she's convinced of her own worth, even as Souad slings insults at her and her work.
  Very negative
But she is sensitive about her relative illiteracy in French.
  Positive
It's a marker of her otherness not just from the French culture, but from her own daughters, who speak the language fluently and help her sort out confusing turns of phrase, with middling success.
  Positive
So Fatima's ability to express herself in language is important, and is another way of pushing back on a culture that wants to mark her as part of an uneducated underclass.
  Positive
And in some ways, thoughFatima is a simple, but strongly drawn story of three immigrant women from two generations struggling to sort out their place in contemporary French society, it also boasts streaks of more universal feminism.
  Positive
The women don't go around talking abouthaving it all, because they're working hard to have anything at all particularly Nesrine, who is terrified to fail in school mostly because she couldn't face seeing her parents' hopes dashed.
  Negative
But as a woman who wears a veil, raises daughters, and works very long hours while trying to learn the language and culture of the people around her, Fatima's statement about intifadais revealing.
  Negative
For her, the goal isn't to beFrench, but to resist the expectations she feels from other women like her and carve out her own path.
  Negative
Raising her daughters, on her own, to be successful women who nonetheless do not forget their roots while not insisting they conform to the expectations of others is her way of exercising her agency.
  Neutral
Director  Philippe Faucon The Disintegration was born in Morocco and raised between Morocco and Algeria before emigrating to his father's native France, and his observation of the three women is both intimate we watch Fatima wash couscous, tie her headscarf, write in her diary, and fight with Souad and entirely without pity.
  Positive
Which is of course as Fatima would have it.
  Negative
She is not sorry for herself, and the movie doesn't ask us to be, either.
  Negative
It's sometimes funny, but always empathetic, and Faucon wisely leaves many of the most dramatic moments off-screen, focusing our attention on how the circumstances and the aftermath affect the women's relationships with one another.
  Positive
At the end of the film, celebrating one of her daughters' successes, we watch Fatima as she slowly reads a list of results posted on the wall.
  Negative
Her smile grows as she registers the details, and in that moment, it's clear: her daughter's success is a sign that her own act of uprising is working.
  Positive
