The turgid revengethriller "The Foreigner" is anall-around lousy movie.
  Very negative
For starters:  Jackie Chan, an action star who is struggling to find age-appropriate roles in his sixties, is barely in "The Foreigner," an adaptation of Stephen Leather's source novel.This is especially disappointing sinceChan's Sparkle Roll Media productioncompany is prominently foregrounded in the film's opening credits, and he's featured prominently in the film's marketing.
  Very negative
Then again, maybe Chan's absence isfor the best given howunconvincing his performance is as grieving -year-old ex-military manQuan.
  Negative
Quan is defined by his age, and his monomaniacal need to get eye-for-an-eye justice since his daughter was blown up in a bank explosion by an organization calling themselves "theAuthentic IRA."
  Negative
SoChan is heavilymade-up withexaggerated crow's feet,gigundo, raccoon-likebagsaround his eyes, and Party Giant-quality grey streaks in his hair.
  Negative
He alsowears a mile-long face, and isn't as energetic or gracefulas he has beenin superiorrecent films like "Chinese Zodiac" or " Railroad Tigers."
  Negative
Chan also tends to vanishfor long stretches at a timewhile a bunch of British and Irish diplomats, policemen,and terrorists talk, debrief, and generally drown viewers in a convoluted storyof political intrigue.
  Negative
Imagine all the worst parts of a  Robert Ludlum novel overlong expository dialogue, monotonous and all-too-brief action scenes, and a hero who can never be found when you need him and replace Jason Bourne with Jackie Chan playing an unflattering Charles Bronson-type character and you have "The Foreigner."
  Negative
Much of "The Foreigner" revolves around the back-channel dealings of Irish diplomat Liam Hennessy  Pierce Brosnan, a former-IRA member who is now hellbent on protecting his decades-longlegacy ofdiplomacy with the British.
  Negative
So he does what any Bourne-style politico does: he gathers a bunch of guys in a boardroom, and he yells at them about how he wants to know who the Authentic IRA is names, dates, camera footage, etc.
  Negative
Turn over every stone, shake every tree, climb every mountain he wants those guys yesterday!
  Negative
Hennessy, an antihero defined by Brosnan's atrocious Irish accent and aforehead peppered withliver spots that seem to proliferate with every extreme closeup, spends a lot of timeon the phone, and drinking Scotch.
  Very negative
He also doeswhateveryother Bourne-style government wonk does: repeatedly curse out his men about how they're alwaysa few steps behind the AuthenticIRA, and Quan, the latter of whom has declareda personalwar on Hennessy since the Irishman haspreviouslyworked with the IRA.
  Negative
We pauseto reflect on the anti-IrishBritish politics of "The Foreigner."
  Negative
Why, exactly, do we need a movie that condemns the Irish for having a violent past, despiterecentpeacefulcollaboration with the Brits?WhyIrish terrorism, of all things,ina year where institutionalized misogyny andWhite Nationalism have become unavoidable topics?
  Negative
Chan has, in the past, spoken out against anti-Chinese-government protesters.
  Neutral
So it's not too much of a leap in logic to imagine that his reactionary real-life politics might lead him todisdainterrorists who become politicians.
  Negative
Still:thisis the problem he feels should be exploited for an action film?
  Neutral
Sure, everybody from a disenfranchisedThor to a newly-revived Paul Kerseywants revenge this year, but picking onthe Irishis like diagnosing a gunshot victim's cankle as their most pressing concern.
  Negative
Of course, there's a twist that you can see coming duringthe first few minutes.
  Positive
And there's a lot of monotonous, uninspiredJohnRamboBronson in "The Mechanic"-style booby-traps, andmake-shift bomb shenanigans thatultimatelylead tothe most unintentionally funny scene of post-explosionfire-fightingyou're likely to see this year theseguys are so bad at putting out fires that oneguy repeatedlyaimshis hoseat a fire-lessroof.
  Very negative
And there'sa lot of exhausting and exhaustive backstory, none of which plays to Chan's talents as a performer, or director Martin Campbell's strengthsas an action filmmaker.
  Negative
Campbell isbest known as the helmer of the franchise-reviving James Bond films "Casino Royale" and "GoldenEye."
  Neutral
But he was probablyhired to direct "The Foreigner"because of his knack for cheesy revenge dramas, particularly the surprisingly okay  " Edge of Darkness" remake.
  Negative
Sadly, none of that earlierfilm's knack for preposterous, testosterone-driven violence is here in "The Foreigner," possibly because"Edge of Darkness" screenwriter andmeathead cinema poetlaureate William Monahan didn't adapt "The Foreigner" too.
  Very negative
As a result, watching "The Foreigner" is a thoroughly dispiriting experience.
  Negative
Youwait for characters to take a break from gabbingabout Hennessy's connectionswith everyone from old IRA members to, uh, newer IRA members.
  Negative
But when Chan finally does swing into action, it's in scenes that over-emphasize his character's age, and lack of coordination.
  Negative
Chan, as Quan,falls over himself fartoo much.
  Negative
He clearly has some moves, but hischaracter is supposed to be old and slow.
  Negative
So Chan must get pummeled twice for every blow he lands.
  Negative
Sadly,the blows that Chan does dish outare graceless and mechanical.
  Very negative
The choreography of these scenes is intentionallyragged, even if Campbell films them well enough.
  Positive
Chan may still be figuring out what he can and can't do in his old age.
  Neutral
But dreck like "The Foreigner" should be swiftlycrossed off his bucket list, and never revisited.
  Negative
