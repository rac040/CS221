If you espouse a belief that we only progress through challenge, what kind of responsibility must you take for the degree of challenge involved?
  Negative
Was the tragedy in an Arizona sweat lodge that killed three clients of motivational speaker James Arthur Ray inevitable given the human need to constantly up the risk to up the reward?
  Negative
And should Ray have been legally or morally responsible for what happened?
  Negative
The great thing about Enlighten Us: The Rise and Fall of James Arthur Ray, airing on CNN this Thursday night, December , is it doesnt attempt to answer these questions in a straightforward manner.
  Negative
Director  Jenny Carchman recognizes that there are no easy, satisfying answers in such a complex situation.
  Negative
Followers of The Secret star James Arthur Ray went into a plastic-encased tent in the middle of the Arizona desert and three of them never came out.Its the very complexity of this situation that makes for fascinating TV, along with Carchmans respect for all the players and a refusal to turn Enlighten Us into an "answer movie."
  Negative
From his very first interview, Ray is a captivating subject.
  Positive
He pantomimes when he talks, taking a minor leap when he says the word bounding or pretending to color with crayons.
  Negative
At several points in Enlighten Us, he allows a peek behind the curtain.
  Positive
For example, theres an amazing bit in which he talks about the impact of blocking his motivational speeches, how it works psychologically to keep issues of the past stage right and issues of the future stage left, because thats how our eyes work when were reading.
  Positive
Enlighten Us could have used even more of this deconstruction of the art of motivational speaking but Carchman allows it to come through what is basically a character study of a man seeking redemption.
  Neutral
After the deadly incident, Ray served two years in jail a number that seemed to satisfy nobody, as his victims families thought he should have gotten more while he thought he should have gotten none.
  Negative
His redemption arc, in which Ray tries to rebuild a career in which HE is the primary product, is interesting enough but its shadowed by the ghosts of those who died in Arizona, and a sense that Ray himself has yet to fully process what happened there.
  Positive
There are times when he suggests that what happened to him was a good thing because hes now learning and growing through challenge and I suppose theres no other way to look at it that wouldnt just send a human being into the fetal position.
  Negative
But it still leaves a bad taste to consider the deaths of others as something positive.
  Negative
Ray's comeback arc only gets Enlighten Us so far.
  Negative
And thats why the final act of Carchmans film is so effective and harrowing.
  Positive
She turns her focus, for large portions of the documentary, to the survivors of the Sedona incident, allowing them to detail what happened beat by beat.
  Negative
A picture of a totally unorganized, dangerous event comes clearer, and the idea that Ray must bear some legal and moral responsibility for it is crystalized.
  Negative
Yes, they had done it several times before, but Ray was not just in charge on that day but in several areas of these peoples lives.
  Negative
They couldnt look weak in front of him.
  Negative
They trusted him.
  Neutral
And the final act of Enlighten Us returns the story to these people, humanizing them in a way that makes them relatable and understandable instead of the cable news habit of labeling them cult members.
  Positive
Why would you do something that could kill you?
  Negative
And how responsible are you if you tell someone that their way toward enlightenment is something that could kill them, all while giant profit margins are involved?
  Negative
What I like about Enlighten Us is that it never claims to have all the answers.
  Negative
No one does.
  Neutral
