"The future seems compromised."
  Negative
That line, in Mia Hansen-Lve's "Things to Come," is spoken by an editor at a publishing house, explaining to author Nathalie Chazeaux  Isabelle Huppert why her popular philosophy textbook needs some serious revisions, maybe even an entire "re-branding."
  Negative
The words make sense in the practical context, but when telescoped out into the themes of this beautiful film they take on enormous relevance.
  Positive
The future that Nathalie believed in now "seems compromised."
  Negative
Hansen-Lve's gift is in presenting this vast internal journey with elegance and clarity, resisting the urge for scenery-chewing catharsis, and always examining just how much time operates as a force in our lives whether we acknowledge it or not.
  Positive
In one way or another, Hansen-Lve's films are all about the passage of time.
  Neutral
Nathalie and Heinz  Andr Marcon, both professors of philosophy at universities in Paris, have been married for  years, and have two adult children.
  Negative
There is a comfort in the family dynamic coming from the assumptions of continuity.
  Positive
The kids come over for dinner.
  Neutral
No tension swirls beneath the surface.
  Neutral
Until one day, Heinz tells Nathalie that he has met someone else and will be moving in with her.
  Negative
The ensuing conversation is not accented by tears being shed or crockery being thrown.
  Negative
Nathalie is shocked and blindsided "I thought you would love me forever," she says, stunned, but it takes a while for the reality to really sink in.
  Negative
Meanwhile, life, in all its complexity, continues.
  Positive
Time, like the cliched river, keeps rolling on.
  Negative
When Fabien  Roman Kolinka, her former protg, asks her how she is doing, she says, Its not that serious.
  Negative
My life isnt over.
  Neutral
Deep down, I was prepared.
  Negative
Im lucky to be fulfilled intellectually.
  Neutral
You believe her.
  Neutral
However, life is not just one thing, life is made up of many parts.
  Neutral
Hansen-Lve's narratives are about the many parts.
  Neutral
During the year of time "Things to Come" takes place, Nathalie experiences the dissolution of her marriage, the dawning realization that her high-maintenance mother  Edith Scob can no longer take care of herself, the changing of the guard at her publishing house and the troubling implications of that, and a new friendship with Fabien, a writer of great promise now living in an anarchists' collective in the countryside.
  Negative
She also has to figure out what to do with Pandora, her mother's independent-minded black cat.
  Positive
In " Elle," released last month, Isabelle Huppert also shares the screen with a memorable cat in a key co-starring role.
  Very positive
This type of story long-time marriage falling apart, -something woman now on her own and hanging out with her -something former student comes with expectations attached.
  Negative
We think we know what we are going to see.
  Negative
But Hansen-Lve avoids all of it with Things to Come.
  Negative
Instead of the clich , the film   brisk at points, leisurely in others presents a real-life rhythm of events.
  Positive
People discuss Rousseau and Gnther Anders, they argue about the purpose of philosophy and political action.
  Negative
Nathalies generation is haunted and defined by the upheaval in .
  Negative
She looks at the idealist young anarchists, sitting around the table discussing the concept of authorship, fighting over how to create an alternative paradigm to the only one offered, and she sees herself in her radical youth.
  Negative
But this is not the misty nostalgia of a Baby Boomer.
  Negative
At a family dinner, she says to her kids that, unlike the Stalinists she had been surrounded by back then, she readSolzhenitsyn, end of story.
  Negative
She tosses that off casually as she puts the food on the table, but its one of the many evocative details in the script that rings so true, providing the texture and context for Nathalies world and experience.
  Positive
Solzhenitsyns The Gulag Archipelagowas published in  and for many it completely detonated any lingering idealism about the USSR.
  Negative
What happens is not as important asHansen-Lve's attitude towards what happens.
  Negative
In this, and in her other films, Tout est pardonne, Father of My Children, " Goodbye First Love" and  Eden," she is interested in a character or, in the case of "Eden," a specific scene and how it evolves over time.
  Negative
There is a George Eliot style of distance in her approach, although she is not unattached or indifferent.
  Positive
Her distance helps her to create extremely detailed scenarios, rich with complexity and accuracy, as though her perch on a cloud gives her more perspective.
  Very positive
She is not intimidated by Aristotles unities.
  Negative
She peppers the action with title cards: Several Years Earlier.
  Neutral
One Year Later .
  Positive
etc.
  Neutral
Characters dont age visibly.
  Negative
She has been criticized for that with her other films, but that criticism seems to be focusing on the wrong things.
  Neutral
She's one of our current great humanists.
  Positive
Things to Come is filled with connecting scenes that another director might cut out, thinking they are not necessary or are filler.
  Negative
Theres one sequence where Nathalie is first shown being driven to the train, then shown getting out of the car and running across the train platform, and then getting out of a taxi at the other end of her train ride.
  Negative
Another film might have just cut directly to Nathalies eventual destination, because who cares about whats in between if nothing happens in between?
  Negative
But Hansen-Lve is all about the in-between, and she always has one eye on the clock.
  Positive
Nobody can avoid time.
  Negative
Nobody can skip over steps in any given sequence at least until teleporting is invented, and that includes fictional characters.
  Negative
Hansen-Lve doesnt belabor the point at their best, her films feel effortless, or even make a point of it at all.
  Positive
Everything is carefully considered and chosen, but not fetishized or dwelled upon.
  Negative
The overall sense is that you are watching an actual life unfold, in its minutia and in its enormity.
  Positive
Because philosophy is at the center of Nathalies life, it is at the center of Things to Come.
  Negative
Philosophy is not just thought about.
  Negative
It is lived.
  Positive
At one point, Nathalie goes to a movie by herself, seeing  Abbas Kiarostamis  Certified Copy, starring another French luminary,  Juliette Binoche.
  Negative
Certified Copy examines reality and illusion, forgery and the real deal: how do we know the difference?
  Negative
Hansen-Lve is confident enough not to bury the lede.
  Positive
Nathalies lectures to her students explicitly comment on her experiences, her current situation.
  Neutral
So do the books she reads.
  Negative
So do the movies she sees.
  Neutral
None of this is too obvious, a common criticism with such devices.
  Negative
To be fair, usually directors use them with all the subtlety of a jackhammer.
  Negative
In Hansen-Lves hands, these devices are an accurate reflection of how thinking people respond to the art they absorb.
  Positive
Who hasnt read a book and thought it spoke exactly to their own life at that moment?
  Neutral
Who hasnt seen a film and thought, My God, did that director find my journal or something?
  Neutral
Hamlet famously says,  There are more thingsin heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
  Negative
The toppling of Nathalies world, the realization that her expected future has now been compromised, leaves her open to that possibility.
  Negative
In each of her films, Hansen-Lve has the patience to wait for what Henri Cartier-Bresson called the decisive moment, the moment where something "small," something detailed and specific, reveals the universal.
  Positive
Things to Come is full of such moments.
  Positive
It does not have the impressive sprawl of Eden, the hothouse plot of Goodbye First Love, or even the melodrama of Father of My Children.
  Negative
Things to Come is the detailed tapestry of one womans life, as she moves through an important transition.
  Positive
Taken together, these films already represent an extremely important body of work.
  Positive
