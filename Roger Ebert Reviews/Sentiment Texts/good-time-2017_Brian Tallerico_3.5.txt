Theres a hum to the night of major cities.
  Negative
Its the sound of unceasing traffic, neon lights buzzing, televisions on in every apartment, and more, and it creates a unique energy that you dont find outside of places like New York City, Atlanta, Chicago, etc.
  Negative
Its the kind of anxious energy that comes with a lack of sleep paranoid and twitchy.
  Neutral
That hum pervades the Safdie brothers excellent Good Time, a film that reminds me of great city movies of the s like  Mean Streets and  Dog Day Afternoon.
  Very positive
With a central performance from  Robert Pattinson that feels like a direct descendant of  Al Pacinos in that Lumet film, Good Time is a movie that cant sit still, and I mean that in the best possible way.
  Positive
Theres a palpable sense of anxiety and panic that comes through in every heated frame after the films inciting incident.
  Positive
Its one of those rare movies that makes you feel edgy, conveying its protagonists dilemma in ways that prey on your nerves and emotions more than just relaying a night-from-hell anecdote.
  Positive
Good Time opens with one of its only relatively sedate scenes although even it is filmed in such a way that it feels tense.
  Negative
Nick Nikas the films co-director  Ben Safdie sits uncomfortably in a court-ordered therapy session.
  Neutral
Through the exchange with his doctor Peter Verby, we learn that Nick was violent with his grandmother, and that hes mentally handicapped enough to not fully understand how to control his anger or the social repercussions of his actions.
  Negative
Just as the therapist is getting somewhere, Nicks brother Connie Pattinson bursts in and takes Nick out of the room.
  Negative
Connie thinks hes doing good by protecting his brother of course, he is not.
  Negative
And this will be a theme of the night ahead of Connie, one in which hell constantly try to fix a situation but only make it worse.
  Negative
The movie proper opens with a bank robbery.
  Neutral
Nick and Connie want , from a bank and appear to get away with it before a dye pack covers them, and their payload, in bright red dye.
  Positive
Nick gets nabbed by the cops, sending him to Rikers Island.
  Negative
Too much of the robbery money is ruined to make his bail, so Connie needs to come up with k as quickly as possible to get him out.
  Very negative
He starts with his girlfriend  Jennifer Jason Leigh, and, well, things get crazier from there in ways that I wouldnt dare spoil.
  Positive
Working again with the great cinematographer  Sean Price Williams who shot the Safdies  Heaven Knows What,  Alex Ross Perrys  Queen of Earth, and others, the Safdies give Good Time a claustrophobic energy thats hard to fully convey in a review.
  Negative
Its accomplished through intense close-ups and a style that could be called jittery but never calls too much attention to itself.
  Neutral
Its a visual language designed to enhance the enhance the mood of its leading man without distracting from it, and it works remarkably with an assist by a pulsing score from  Daniel Lopatin.
  Positive
Having said that, most of what shines so well about Good Time can be traced back to Robert Pattinsons performance, the best of an already-impressive career.
  Very positive
He is impossible to ignore from his very first scene, expressing Connies ability to only keep digging himself deeper and deeper into trouble.
  Negative
Connie makes choices instantly, and one gets the impression that its an instinctual ability that has helped him at times but will only prove his downfall on this particular night.
  Negative
Good Time is essentially one long chase movie the story of a man trying to evade capture for a bank robbery and get his brother out of the predicament into which he threw him and Pattinson perfectly conveys the nervous energy of being essentially hunted by your own bad decisions without ever feeling like hes chewing scenery.
  Negative
Like Pacino in the s, theres something in the eyes and the body language, an unease about whats going to happen next, an inability to sit down.
  Negative
It is a stunning performance, and one of the best of  by far.
  Very positive
By and large, films are passive experiences.
  Neutral
We sit in the dark and allow stories to play out in front of us, behind the safety of the movie screen.
  Negative
Movies like Good Time that break down that comfort and make us as edgy as their protagonists are rare and should be embraced.
  Positive
They give us the characters that stand the test of time and, as with Dog Day Afternoon, people keep discussing four decades after their release.
  Positive
Connie Nikas is one of those characters.
