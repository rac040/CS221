  Negative
Two years before Carpenter's death, there was a TV movie about the struggles of an anorexic girl  Jennifer Jason Leigh called "The Best Little Girl in the World."
  Negative
If you were of a certain age, you probably remember seeing it.
  Positive
It was a TV event!
  Neutral
When Carpenter died, "The Best Little Girl in the World" was often mentioned as a reference point, almost like the culture was trying to put the baffling pieces together: "Karen Carpenter died of that thing we all were just talking about two years ago.
  Negative
Remember that?"
  Neutral
We know a lot more now.
  Neutral
The new Netflix-produced drama, "To the Bone," written and directed by  Marti Noxon, tells the tale of a young anorexic using the inside-joke gallows humor of the "rexies" anorexics themselves.
  Negative
Instead of approaching the topic in a solemn "issue of the week" way, "To the Bone" tries to lighten the mood.
  Neutral
There are aspects of this approach that are refreshing.
  Positive
Noxon clearly knows the territory.
  Positive
But the end result is confusing and unfocused.
  Negative
Individual scenes shine, but the overall arc suffers.
  Neutral
"To the Bone" isn't all that interested in the actual treatment of the condition, even though the majority of the film takes place in a treatment program.
  Negative
The film also gets hugely distracted by a romantic sub-plot, a sub-plot that is pushy and awkward from the jump.
  Negative
In the opening scene, Ellen  Lily Collins a -year-old artist with clothes hanging off of her like a scarecrow is booted out of a treatment program for her "defiant attitude."
  Negative
She goes to stay with her father who never appears in the film, stepmother  Carrie Preston and stepsister  Liana Liberato.
  Positive
She's been sick for so long that her entire family, scared and exhausted, has given her up for dead.
  Negative
Ellen's mother Judy  Lili Taylor came out as gay when Ellen was , and now lives in Phoenix running a horse therapy farm with her partner Olive  Brooke Smith.
  Negative
Moving away was an abandonment of her troubled child, but also an act of self-preservation.
  Negative
Ellen's cheery yet firm stepmother is the only one on the ball in the extended parental unit, and she gets Ellen a place at Threshold, a treatment center run by a doctor known for his unconventional methods.
  Positive
This is Dr. Beckham, played by  Keanu Reeves with his trademark simplicity.
  Negative
There are six other patients in the Threshold house, each one defined by their particular issue.
  Negative
There's the pregnant anorexic.
  Neutral
There's the girl who stashes her barf in a paper bag under the bed.
  Negative
There's the girl with the feeding tube.

  Very positive
They speak in the code of their illnesses.
  Neutral
Two girls talk about binging, one saying, "Ice cream comes up the easiest."
  Positive
There's a discussion about whether or not  Emma Stone is fat.
  Negative
Ellen says she thinks Stone just has "big bones."
  Neutral
A lot of this dialogue has the unmistakable queasy ring of truth, of dirty dark secrets being told.
  Negative
Dr. Beckham's unconventional approach involves taking them to an art installation where water falls through the ceiling and then encouraging his patients to dance under the indoor rainfall.
  Negative
Its a major sequence, with inspirational music.
  Positive
Other than that and what, exactly, was that?
  Negative
, we rarely see him at work with the patients.
  Neutral
There are elements of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy involved in his approach, mixed with some "tough love" tactics.
  Negative
He tells Ellen that she needs to tell her brain to "fuck off."
  Neutral
Ellen responds well to this sort of thing.
  Positive
Shes a straight shooter, too.
  Negative
But we don't see enough of his work to see what it is, how it works, how it might not work.
  Negative
"To the Bone" gets interested, instead, in the budding relationship between Luke and Ellen.
  Positive
The script has Luke, a version of the famed "manic pixie dream girl,"insistingon things a lot, insisting that Ellen go out to dinner with him, insisting she eat a chocolate bar even though she tells him multiple times she doesn't want to, insisting they kiss even when she's clearly not really into it, insisting, insisting, insisting ... it's hard to tell what Noxon was going for here.
  Very negative
This subplot takes up a lot of bandwidth.
  Positive
It doesn't help that Noxon's staging of a couple of scenes is so awkward that you can still see the blocking.
  Negative
"To the Bone" does not get at root causes.
  Negative
It does not try to explain why.
  Negative
It does not lecture.
  Negative
All of this is in its favor, to a degree.
  Positive
But Ellen herself remains a cipher.
  Neutral
There's a lack of interest in who she is, what she's about, where she's coming from.
  Negative
We see what she does, we see her outward "attitude," but that's about it.
  Neutral
There have been plenty of "eating disorder" movies since "Best Little Girl in the World," but the narrative hasn't embedded itself in storytelling culture in the same way that drug or alcohol addiction narratives have.
  Neutral
Eating disorders are a thornier issue, stranger, more intractable, scarier.
  Negative
The wider culture participates in perpetuating these illnesses, and so maybe thats one of the reasons why Hollywood a place filled with thin women is hesitant to address the issue.
  Negative
Thinness is so equated with beauty norms that it's a culture-wide propaganda bomb.
  Negative
Two months after a celebrity gives birth people start making fun of what she looks like in her bathing suit.
  Positive
Girls get the message very young.
  Neutral
To address anorexia in particular, you would have to address the entire culture's preoccupation with weight, its obsession with policing what women look like.
  Negative
Eating disorders are symptoms of the sickness of society.
  Negative
"To the Bone"'s self-awareness about the illness and those who suffer is laudatory, and some of the scenes will undoubtedly be revelatory to those unfamiliar with the lingo and behavior of eating disorders.
  Negative
These scenes will also ring true for anyone who's suffered.
  Negative
To the Bone does not treat its lead character as a poor and passive victim, sick though she may be.
  Negative
But the film loses focus in fits and starts along the way.
  Negative
The girl at its center cannot hold the center.
  Negative
