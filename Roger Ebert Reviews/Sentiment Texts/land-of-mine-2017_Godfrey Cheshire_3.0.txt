When we first see Sgt. Rasmussen  Roland Mller in the opening moments of the Danish drama Land of Mine, hes driving along in a Jeep with a look that recalls Woodys Harrelsons derelict cop at the opening of  Rampart jut-jawed, determined, a fierce, unforgiving gleam in his eye.
  Negative
It is the spring of .
  Neutral
Germany has surrendered and its forces are leaving Denmark after occupying it for five years.
  Negative
Driving by a column of bedraggled German soldiers, Rasmussen spots one carrying a crumpled Danish flag.
  Negative
He screeches to a halt, jumps out of the Jeep and head-butts the man fiercely, screaming, Thats not your flag!
  Negative
And thats not the end of it.
  Negative
While the dazed man lies on the ground, Rasmussen continues pounding him with his fists, till theres blood all over his face, the ground and the flag.
  Negative
Such a display of anger at the Nazi occupiers on the part of a Dane is understandable, but its only individual.
  Negative
The punishment described by writerdirector  Martin Zandvliet in Land of Mine, though, is collective.
  Negative
It involved using numerous German soldiers to clear hundreds of thousands of land mines that the Nazis had left buried along the Danish coast, resulting in the deaths of many.
  Negative
Rather curiously, the film itself doesnt say what its press notes spell out: under the international treaties of day as well as the  Geneva Convention, this action which was ordered by the British but carried out by the Danes was a war crime.
  Negative
According to Zandvliet, it has never been dealt with adequately in Danish histories or public discussions of the period.
  Negative
Granted, there are large and very obvious reasons why Nazis have been portrayed as the most brutal of human monsters in the popular mythology of the movies.
  Negative
But it was always a simplification that invited correction.
  Negative
In ,  Wolfgang Petersens  Das Boot, about the perils of life aboard a Nazi U-boat, became an international hit in part by humanizing the servicemen whose lives it dramatized.
  Negative
Land of Mine belongs to the line of mostly European films that have continued that effort.
  Positive
Its task is simplified somewhat by the fact that the Nazi Reich has been reduced to smoldering rubble by the time the story begins, and the Germans we see are scared, skinny kids drafted into the army near the wars end most look in the -to--year-old range.
  Negative
In an early scene, Danish officers explain to them that Denmarks coast was the most heavily mined in Europe, apparently because Hitler expected the Allied invasion to come there since it was the closest land point to Berlin.
  Negative
More than two million mines were left behind.
  Negative
How many have seen mines, the boys are asked.
  Negative
Only a few hands go up.
  Neutral
So, the Danes provide instruction on this very perilous undertaking.
  Negative
It involves taking a stick and probing the sand till a mines metal bulk is detected, then gently removing it from the sand and defusing it by unscrewing and extracting the trigger.
  Positive
Needless to say, one wrong move and life or limb can be sacrificed.
  Negative
When the story proper begins, Sgt. Rasmussen is in charge of  young Germans in a makeshift camp near a beach.
  Negative
The press notes dont say whether a group of prisoners was commonly left to a single Dane' it seems a little improbable.
  Negative
At first, he seems as a fierce as he did in that first scene.
  Negative
He tells the boys there are , mines buried on a nearby beach' if they remove six an hour, they can go home a few months hence assuming they dont blow themselves up while executing their task.
  Negative
In the tales first stage, the Dane treats his charges in a fashion that verges from screaming ferocity into near-sadism.
  Negative
Were never told the slightest bit about what his particular beef against the Nazis is' we can just assume that as a Dane he has some serious ones.
  Negative
After practically starving the boys and lying to them about one of their number who was injured, however, he begins to soften, to see them as individuals and treat them like actual human beings.
  Negative
Later still, an incident that he blames them for sends him tilting back toward hostility.
  Negative
These shifts of attitude on Rasmussens part can feel a little too abrupt and formulaic in enforcing the dramatic pivots of a standard three-act structure.
  Negative
Nevertheless, the film remains generally believable and consistently engaging due to the high quality of its execution.
  Positive
As Rasmussen, Mller, who has a chiseled Nordic demeanor akin to  Michael Fassbenders, gives a terrific performance, both intense and carefully shaded.
  Positive
The German boys are very well cast, with young actors  Louis Hofmann and  Joel Basman especially giving the kind of striking performances that should lead to other films.
  Positive
Zandvliet has said he and his cinematographer wife  Camilla Hjelm Knudsen looked to certain films of the s as inspiration for the look of Land of Mine, and the influence is salutary.
  Negative
With its muted colors and naturalistic lighting the film aptly captures the beauty of seaside locales that frame the human struggle at the storys heart.
  Positive
