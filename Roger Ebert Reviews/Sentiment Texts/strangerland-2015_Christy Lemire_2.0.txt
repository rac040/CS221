Strangerland marks  Nicole Kidmans first starring role in an independent Australian film since s  Dead Calm, the movie that put her on the map.
  Negative
Over the many years since Philip Noyces claustrophobic thriller on the high seas, Kidman consistently has surprised us and taken chances in a variety of parts.
  Positive
She hasdared to visit dark and disturbing places to explore the complicated psychologies of her characters.
  Positive
This is certainly true, as well, in Strangerland, in which she plays a wife and mother devastated by the disappearance of her two children from a middle-of-nowhere desert town.
  Positive
If only her performance were in the service of a better film.
  Negative
Director  Kim Farrants debut feature is beautifully shot and offers some powerful, well-acted moments from a strong cast, but its just relentlessly dreary.
  Negative
Despite some striking, widescreen imagery from Irish cinematographer PJ Dillon including shimmering sunsets, craggy canyons and a doozy of a dust storm Strangerland is, more often than not, lifeless and languid.
  Negative
Its a missing-kid mystery with some red herrings and misplaced mysticism, all of which leads to an ending thats coy in its intentional ambiguity and ultimately unsatisfying.
  Negative
Theres tension at the start, though, with the help of some effectively minimalist sound design: the thrum of a ceiling fan, the scratch of a pencil on a crossword puzzle, a fly buzzing overhead in the kitchen.
  Negative
Working from a script by Fiona Seres and  Michael Kinirons, Farrant creates a vivid sense of loneliness and isolation.
  Positive
You actually might think youve walked into a zombie movie by mistake' its opening sequence features a pre-teen boy wandering by himself through the silent streets and desolate remnants of civilization in a small, dusty town.
  Negative
This is fictional Nathgari, where the Parker family reluctantly moved recently.
  Negative
Father Matthew  Joseph Fiennes is a pharmacist whos away at work most of the day.
  Positive
That leaves Kidmans Catherine to care for their two children: angsty, adolescent Tommy Nicholas Hamilton and his -year-old sister, the sultry Lily  Maddison Brown.
  Negative
There are allusions to a scandal involving this young woman, which forced the family to relocate, but her barely-there clothing and provocative demeanor provide early clues.
  Neutral
Its hot, and theyre bored, so they do what kids do all over the world when theyre hot and bored: spend their days at the towns makeshift skate park.
  Negative
Its a bleak place dotted with worn-out furniture, trashed shipping containers and disenfranchised youth, including a vaguely hunky dude named Steve  Sean Keenan with an ominous serpent tattoo.
  Very negative
One night, out of nowhere, Tommy and Lily get out of their beds, leave the house and wander into the vast unknown.
  Negative
The police detective assigned to the case, Rae  Hugo Weaving, turns to Steve as an early suspect.
  Negative
But theres also Burtie Meyne Wyatt, a slow-minded but good-hearted Aboriginal man whos been helping out around the Parkers house.
  Negative
And there is a dust storm: a meteorological act of mythical proportions that covers everything and everyone in a thick, orange haze, physically and psychologically.
  Negative
Any or all of these may have been factors in the kids ongoing disappearance.
  Negative
Or not.
  Neutral
Lilys diary, which Catherine finds hidden in her bedroom, further confuses matters as does Lilys wispy poetry, which we hear in breathy voiceover.
  Negative
Farrant aims to explore several dynamics and themes at once here: loss of innocence, indigenous mythology, societal judgment and a marriage in peril.
  Negative
Matthew and Catherines bond already was a tenuous one they routinely sleep in separate bedrooms but it rips apart once the children are gone.
  Negative
Despite the films prevailing quiet and understatement, though, Strangerland tries to encompass too much, which makes it feel scattered and unfocused.
  Negative
A monotonous feeling of blame and guilt is constant, however.
  Negative
Kidman has several strong moments with Weaving, who gives a commanding yet sympathetic performance as a man whos suffered losses of his own.
  Positive
Her scenes with Fiennes never have that kind of spark, though, mainly because his primary character trait is stoicism, punctuated by a couple of impetuous acts of bloody violence.
  Negative
But her steady collapse provides the films spine and is the main element that keeps the film watchable, even as it wanders into uncomfortable territory and drags to its conclusion.
  Positive
That a mother would become increasingly bereft over the disappearance of her children is more than understandable, but in Kidmans hands, this woman lays herself bare in more ways than one.
  Negative
Its unsettling, but she can only do so much.
  Neutral
