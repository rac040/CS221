You might have heard of the  doc  On Any Sunday, produced by avid motorcycle guy  Steve McQueen and directed by  Bruce Brown, whod made his name prior to it with groundbreaking movies about surfing, particularly s  The Endless Summer.

But did you know that  Sunday was kind of the start of a franchise?

On Any Sunday  followed in .

In , Bruce Browns son Dana, who has also made his own surfing movie, s Step Into Liquid Danas also behind some Summer sequels, but lets not get too confusing, made On Any Sunday Revisited, followed by a making-of on the first picture, On Any Sunday: Motocross, Malcolm and More, and now Dana presents The Next Chapter.
  Negative
My recollection of the first On Any Sunday movie is less of the movie itself than of an impression of the audience that embraced it: workaday American men who looked at biking as a form of unalienated leisure, an exhilarating escape.

A measure of how the world has changed is given the viewer in this movies opening presentation logos: a welder works on a bike in a sparkling garage, while a little girl cavorts about' the logo Red Bull Media House manifests itself in D, followed by the logo of Freeride Entertainment' were then informed, in this garage, that what follows is Supported By Skullcandy.

  Very negative
I mean, dont get me wrong, the stuff about the deaf female motorcyclist Ashley Fiolek is interesting and somewhat touching, but to this viewer it would have been even more so had I not been assured about how surprised I was going to be right at the outset.

  Negative
Brown declines to venture into this area.
