Another film about junkies?
  Neutral
That question almost inevitably follows ones learning the subject of Josh and Benny Safdies New York-set drama Heaven Knows What, and its main implication is clear: heroin addiction is at once so limited and so overdone as a narrative premise that filmmakers approaching it need to have something new to say, or to show.
  Negative
Unfortunately, the Safdies dont.
  Negative
Their film is the latest in a long line of movies that seem to assume the milieu of addiction is justification enough for its existence.
  Negative
The result is a work that like a whole sub-species of French films of the recent decades fetishizes its own hyper-naturalistic visual style and performances all but one by non-actors while offering no original or striking insights into the world it portrays.
  Positive
No doubt the films surface attractions and its core weaknesses both owe to its origins.
  Negative
Reportedly, the Safdies were researching a project in New Yorks diamond district when they spotted a pretty young blonde who they assumed might be a Russian diamond worker.
  Negative
Turns out she was a heroin addict from New Jersey named  Arielle Holmes who had a troubled romantic relationship with another addict named Ilya.
  Negative
Fascinated by Holmes stories of her street life, the Safdies persuaded her to write an account of it, a manuscript that became the basis for their screenplay co-written by  Ronald Bronstein.
  Negative
With Holmes playing Harley, a character who apparently differs from herself in name only, the filmmakers shot in the neighborhoods she frequented using people she knew as secondary characters and hidden cameras to disguise their presence a technique also employed in  Oren Movermans forthcoming Time Out of Mind, about a New York homeless man.
  Negative
The look, of course, is very close to that of a documentary, which raises the question: Why isnt Heaven Knows What a documentary?
  Positive
If conveying the reality of junkie life was the main objective, that course might have been more productive.
  Negative
As in many other cases, turning real-life material into drama can produce an awkward hybrid: a film in which the reality is diluted by fictionalization, while the fiction is rendered thin and sometimes clichd due to being shackled to its real-life origins.
  Negative
So it is here.
  Positive
When we first see Harley, shes in full hyperactive mode, threatening suicide to the long-haired, plainly doped-up Ilya  Caleb Landry Jones, whos far more interested in the public computer hes staring at.
  Negative
Shes so desperately in love that she wants to sacrifice her life for him.
  Neutral
His groggy response: If you want to prove your love, go ahead and off yourself.
  Negative
One gets the feeling this pathetic little melodrama among the drug-addled has been having a long run.
  Negative
Soon enough, though, Harley makes good on her morbid proposal, buying a razor at a bodega and cutting her wrist in a park with Ilya looking on.
  Negative
Whisked to a hospital, shes left with only some nasty-looking stitches as proof of her love.
  Negative
For a while thereafter, thankfully, Ilya disappears from her life and two other guys take his place.
  Positive
Skully rapper Necro is a burly dude in a baseball cap who offers to treat her well and help her out, though it seems like he might have other agendas as well.
  Negative
She, in any case, isnt interested in being courted with kind behavior and rebuffs him.
  Neutral
Far more important is the relationship with Mike Buddy Duress, who also seems to want to help her but is constantly exasperated by her neediness, unreliability and demands for both dope and credit.
  Negative
Unlike Skully, he evidences no romantic feelings for Harley though he plainly despises Ilya, a point that becomes more important later in the story but is nevertheless bound to her by their never-ending rounds of scoring, shooting up and finding places to crash.
  Negative
Though the protagonists here end up in hospitals repeatedly, there are no doctors, therapists or social workers as characters.
  Negative
Nor are there parents, family members, non-junkie friends, police officers or similar.
  Neutral
The film keeps its characters in a tightly circumscribed bubble of junkie-dom, and thats one thing that makes it feel a bit phony, less a probing, realistic view of a complex milieu than one that partakes of the junkies own gauzy self-involvement as well as previous fictions oblique romanticizing of them.
  Negative
Given the films relative weakness on the narrative level, its performances become all the more important, and here the news is largely good.
  Positive
For a first-timer, Holmes is amazingly assured and precise.
  Positive
Landry Jones mopey, narcissistic Ilya, meanwhile, is solid and convincing, though not as extraordinary as his turn in  John Boormans  Queen and Country earlier this year.
  Very positive
The stand-out, though, is  Buddy Duress Mike.
  Negative
Though its clear the reputed street legend is not an experienced actor, his work has a force and rough authenticity that make it edgily compelling, his mannerisms and vocal intonations sometimes recalling the young Elliott Gould.
  Positive
A stand-out of another sort is the camerawork of Sean Price Williams.
  Negative
Using understated lighting, long lenses both outdoors and in close-quartered interiors, and near-constant re-framings, this gifted cinematographer turns in a bravura performance that fully realizes the naturalistic intent of the Safdies stylistic approach.
  Negative
That such verit-like verisimilitude cant substitute for dramatic truth is an obvious truism, but Willliams sharp work offers its own elegant justifications.
  Positive
