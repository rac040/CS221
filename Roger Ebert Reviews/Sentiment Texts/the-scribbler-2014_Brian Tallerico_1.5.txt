With narrative echoes of Sucker Punch and stylistic commonalities with  Sin City, one would expect  John Suits The Scribbler, adapted by graphic novelist  Dan Schaffer, to at least be a bit of escapist fun.
  Negative
A female empowerment, mental illness-defeating, noir-esque comic book movie with B-movie Goddesses like  Gina Gershon,  Sasha Grey and  Eliza Dushku?
  Negative
Where do I buy tickets?
  Neutral
And yet The Scribbler never clicks into the escapist mind fk it really needed to be to work.
  Negative
It can't maintain its style and never finds its substance.
  Negative
Its a ridiculous narrative with scenery-chewing performances, but it doesnt have the form to match.
  Negative
Its dull when one wants it to be ludicrous, and serves as a reminder of how hard it is to bring comic books to celluloid life on a limited budget.
  Negative
Suki  Katie Cassidy has multiple personalities, one of which is the title character.
  Negative
Her Doctor  Billy Campbell has developed a technique known as The Siamese Burn, which is essentially a massive shock to the system designed to destroy the extraneous personalities one at a time.
  Negative
But which ones are extraneous?
  Neutral
And what will she do when shes down to two?
  Neutral
Questions like these linger in the background of what is also a poorly-written mystery.
  Neutral
The Burn subplot is actually part of a flashback conveyed through an investigation by two police officers Eliza Dushku,  Michael Imperioli into why all of Sukis fellow inhabitants of Juniper Tower happen to be showing up dead.
  Negative
The Tower is a halfway house for the mentally and socially inept, which allows for a cavalcade of odd characters, including a bunny ear-wearing Sasha Grey, milk bath-taking Gina Gershon, disturbing  Michelle Trachtenberg, scene-stealing  Garret Dillahunt and a girl who just walks around naked Ashlynn Yennie.
  Negative
One by one, most of these characters jump from Juniper Tower, leading one to wonder if The Scribbler doesnt have echoes of  Identity as well and these people are all just dying personalities of the films protagonist.
  Negative
The best moments of The Scribbler embrace the films ridiculous concept with overheated dialogue pulled from the noiraction comic book manual.
  Negative
Why dont you tell me what happened, from the beginning?
  Negative
Thats not always the best way to tell a story.
  Positive
Those lines early in Schaffers film sets it up as a work that will navigate the traditional storytelling structure in a unique manner, but The Scribbler ends up depressingly linear.
  Neutral
And most of the subtext the burning out of personalities could clearly be read a commentary on control of female individuality and sexuality is underdeveloped to the extreme.
  Negative
The Scribbler feels like an outline of a better film.
  Negative
There are times when one can see what The Scribbler could have become.
  Positive
Garret Dillahunt, so great on Deadwood and Raising Hope, is having a blast as the one guy in Juniper Tower, who checked the wrong box.
  Negative
He even gets a slo-mo sex scene with Cassidy that kind of needs to be seen to be believed.
  Negative
I wanted more of that kind of insanity instead of the drab, episodic pacing of a film that feels way longer than its  minutes.
  Negative
Its ugly when it should be crazy.
  Negative
Someone burned all the personality out of it.
  Negative
