First, and foremost: "Zombeavers" is exactly what it sounds like, a stoner-friendly horror-comedy about undead beavers.
  Positive
This needs over-stating since high-concept humor doesn't get higher than this.
  Negative
Rest assured, "Zombeavers" could have been great   for what its title promises.
  Positive
If you give money to see a film "Zombeavers," you will get what the title promises.
  Neutral
For some, that may be enough.
  Neutral
I confess: it  is  a wacky concept.
  Positive
But you can only bask in the warm glow of a silly concept for so long, and that's saying something given the -minute runtime of the flesh-eating aquatic mammal opus in question.
  Positive
"Zombeavers" is the kind of comedy whose greatest innovation is in its title, a play on words that suggests both a flesh-eating dam-builder, and a deathless female body part.
  Positive
That joke is tellingly flogged like the proverbial dead horse throughout "Zombeavers," a comedy that sounds much funnier than it actually is.
  Negative
It's all down-hill after two Cheech-and-Chong-esque schlubs, played by song-writer  John Mayer and comedian  Bill Burr, make inane but funny, in an unclean, midnight-movie kind of way small-talk about, amongst other things, their dalliances with homosexuality "I hear a lot of myself in this story".
  Negative
They then have an accident, and a canister of hazardous chemicals is accidentally let loose on an unsuspecting population of beavers.
  Negative
Shortly after this, a trio of bratty best friends, including Mary  Rachel Melvin and Zoe  Cortney Palm, retreat to a nearby cabin in the woods in hopes of helping one of their own Jenn  Lexi Atkins, the sympathetic one get over her unfaithful boyfriend Sam  Hutch Dano.
  Negative
But Sam catches up with Jenn, and brings along Buck  Peter Gilroy and Tommy  Jake Weary, Mary and Zoe's respective boyfriends.
  Positive
Then zombeavers strike.
  Neutral
You can't really get mad at "Zombeavers" for having a wispy plot, and insubstantial characterizations.
  Negative
Not immediately, anyway.
  Negative
The film's biggest mis-step is a pseudo-shocking twist that requires you to think of a barely-there character as more than just a place-holder protagonist.
  Negative
But for the most part, "Zombeavers" isn't really about human characters.
  Negative
If anything, it's a waste of perfectly good monster puppets.
  Negative
The film's creature effects are its best selling point, all claws, buck teeth, and milky-white, pupil-less eyes.
  Positive
They're not consistently well-used though, especially in scenes where they're lurking in shadows, waiting to attack.
  Negative
The first time this happens, they look like off-brand Muppets.
  Negative
But each time they repeat this visual gag, they look...well, the same.
  Negative
Nothing changes, and that's kind of a problem in a movie whose main strength is its novelty.
  Negative
Unfortunately, novelty is also "Zombeavers"' only strength.
  Negative
The film's tongue-in-cheek " Night of the Living Dead"-esque scenario is lazily sketched-out, and the film's creators fail to do anything memorable with gun-toting neighbor Smyth Rex Lynn, or the film's secluded, lake-side setting.
  Very negative
The one time the film perks up is a nasty but effective scene of animal cruelty.
  Negative
The rest of the time the film flirts with, but never really commits to a concern with the sisterly ties that bind its heroines.
  Positive
Since Sam and his guy friends are programmatically obsessed with sexing their girlfriends, and avoiding zombeaver bites, the film burdens Mary and her friends with carrying the film.
  Negative
Preliminary scenes where the girls bond suggest that the film's creators have either never talked to girls, or simply do not relish their company.
  Negative
One pointed exchange ends with a girl lamenting "Why are girls so attracted to such assholes?"
  Negative
Another ends with the women cursing their lack of social media access: "I haven't gone more than  hours without Instagram since before there was an Instagram."
  Negative
These clueless exchanges don't look benign once Ben and his friends establish that "beaver" is another way of saying "vagina," thereby giving them a mandate to titter at, and endlessly set each other up for jokes about furry wood-munchers.
  Negative
These jokes would be funny if they weren't the stuff that frat boys' dreams are made of.
  Negative
But that's pretty much the long and short of "Zombeavers," a tedious comedy with a funny title.
  Positive
The film's animal attack scenes aren't suspenseful, the human characters are boring, and the jokes aren't funny.
  Very negative
It's a gross-out comedy that works on that level, but does nothing else right.
  Negative
So instead of renting or venturing out-of-doors to see "Zombeavers," remember: you don't have to do this.
  Negative
There are a myriad other forms of goony-looking entertainment available to you, and many of them are as silly as "Zombeavers."
  Positive
Might I suggest "Food of the Gods?"
  Neutral
Or perhaps Peter Jackson's early comedies, particularly "Dead Alive" and "Bad Taste?"
  Neutral
minutes may not seem like a major time commitment, but trust me: you can do a lot better than "Zombeavers."
  Negative
