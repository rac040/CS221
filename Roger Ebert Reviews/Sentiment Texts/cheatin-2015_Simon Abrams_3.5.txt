You don't need to pay attention to the story in "Cheatin',"a feature-length cartoon and adult fairy tale with no serious moral.
  Negative
"Cheatin'" was created and drawn by BillPlympton, a sensualist, and unabashed lover of muscular, grotesque images.
  Negative
Plympton's alsoa master fantasist, and a genius when it comes to surreal sight gags, crude sexual humor, and almost every other kind of slapstick-y, physical humor.His hand-drawn animation style is impressionistic, a garish combination of water colors and pencils.
  Negative
And his characters in this case, a newly-married couple whose relationship rapidly unravels when she becomes convinced that he's sleeping around can never be confused for realistic: at any given moment, human bodies might stretch, or balloon until they're as big as characters' boisterous feelings.
  Negative
So while "Cheatin'"'sending is a little too manic for its own good, it really doesn't matter whether Plympton's latest yarn turns out to be a tall tale with a happy ending, or a shaggy dog joke with no ending at all.
  Negative
Which isn't to say that "Cheatin'' doesn't have a story.
  Negative
On the contrary, Plympton's scenario plays out like an inverted film noir plot with the woman playing the kind of role obsessively jealous lover that a man normally would.
  Negative
That kind of role reversal feels natural in Plympton's topsy-turvy world.
  Negative
Ella and Jake fall in love at a carnival after he saves her while playing bumper cars.
  Negative
They marry, and enjoy marital bliss that's visualized through a musical number involving giant bunny slippers, and a refrigerator-full of produce that somehow know all the words to Verdi's "Libiamo Ne' Lietti Calici."
  Positive
Jake, he of the brick outhouse physique, doesn't immediately notice Ella's panic and paranoia.
  Negative
But eventually, Ella, she of the hourglass waist, can't help but openly obsess over Jake's perceived infidelity, forcing him to try to understand what's wrong with her.
  Negative
In that sense, "Cheatin'" is essentially an ever-transforming, narrative-light nightmare that Ella and her dream lover can't wake from.
  Negative
In the film's introductory scenes, Ella gets inexplicably picked on by a carnival barker.
  Negative
She stands her ground, and rejects a ticket of admission that he patronizingly hands her.
  Positive
She then spends the bulk of the film stuck in a fantasy that she refuses to admitisa fantasy, wooing a lunk-headed muscle-man who's too dumb to understand when other women are flirting with him.
  Negative
Ella's fantasies are most exciting when she's least in control of herself.
  Positive
Scenes like the one where Jake tries to jump-start his lawn-mower while a nosy neighbor tries to catch his eye are priceless.
  Positive
Ella furtively watches from her house's backdoor while Jake mechanically yanks on his mower's cord.
  Neutral
A handkerchief wafts over.
  Negative
Jake returns it, and goes back to yanking.
  Positive
Then a brassiere lands at his feet.
  Neutral
Jake returns it, and keeps right on pulling.
  Very positive
Then a veritable fleet of linen sails over Jake's head, reminding us that we're in a world motivated by feelings, not sensible logic.
  Negative
Nothing in Plympton's film can be dismissed as "just a dream," because everything in the film is dream-like.
  Negative
Indeed,Ella and Jake are most powerless whenever they try to assert control over their lives through sex, daily chores, or, uh, body-swapping this isn't really a spoiler since it doesn't make any more sense in context.
  Negative
"Cheatin'" is therefore least interesting when it's most rigidly bound by a narrative.
  Negative
Ella and Jake are especially compelling whenever they behave like lumpy shapes that excite, flit about, and then never stop erupting around each other.
  Negative
So while "Cheatin'" does have a narrative spine, it's most entertaining when it's hardest to pin down.
  Positive
You can easily get lost in Plympton's brash animation style since his line-work is simultaneously loose, and decisive.
  Negative
And his sense of humor is infectious because it's well-timed, and proudly freaky, especiallyduring any scene where Jake is ogled by hungry, lip-teasing bachelorettes.
  Positive
The film's singular images stay with you because they're realized with uncommon clarity and boundless energy.
  Positive
"Cheatin'" is a highlight of Plympton's robust body of work because motion not the journey, or the destination is always its creator's priority.
  Positive
