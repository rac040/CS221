On the Internet Movie Database, the plot synopsis for Argentinian drama "Paulina" is appropriatelycurt: "A young woman is raped by a gang."
  Negative
This is a fitting precis since the film feels like, in many ways, a corrective to dramas thatuse sexual assault as a key plot point.
  Negative
For example, while "Paulina" is not sensationalistic,it does show an act of sexual violation.
  Negative
There are also clear heroes and villains in this story, and no attempt is made to completely absolve the guilty parties of their responsibility.
  Negative
Instead, director  Santiago Mitre and co-writer Mariano Lilnas try to get us closer to understanding rather than glibly judging any of the characters involved.
  Negative
This is no small feat given how many times "Paulina" feels like a civics lesson first, and a drama second.
  Negative
Much of the film's outlook aligns with the perspective of Paulina  Dolores Fonzi, a former law student who chooses to move to teach social science in a small town.
  Negative
Paulina's decision to leave behind a prosperous career makes her a target for skepticism both from her conservative father Fernando Oscar Martinez and her sympathetic-but-disengaged boyfriend Alberto Esteban Lamoth.
  Neutral
These supporting characters are largely, but not exclusively defined by how much they roll their eyes at Paulina.
  Negative
Fernando and Albert worry, challenge, and yes, emotionally manipulate Paulina for the sake of winning her over.
  Negative
These are complex characters that actually talk like human beings instead of mustache-twirling accessories to a crime.
  Positive
Likewise, Mitre and Lilnas take time to introduce Ciro  Cristian Salguero, the angry young student who leads a group of friends to rape Paulina.
  Negative
His story is, thankfully, a sub-plot that is only introduced after Paulina is attacked.
  Negative
Ciro's back-story also does not humanize his actions so much that he is presented as a sensitive soul worthy of canned redemption.
  Negative
Instead, we see him as a real person who with real problems and flaws.
  Neutral
Ciro works at a lumber mill.
  Positive
He is quick to anger.
  Negative
He draws in his notebook.
  Positive
And he is sexually frustrated.
  Negative
I won't give too much away, but when he sees Paulina, an inner conflict comes to light.
  Neutral
It's something that isn't easily explained away, but his actions are at least semi-contextualized.
  Negative
As for Paulina: her story lives and dies based on the strength of the conversations that she has.
  Neutral
She knows who raped her, but she doesn't know what to do about it.
  Negative
Paulina's story comes to a halt after she's raped since the remainder of the drama concerns her uncertainty about how to move on.
  Negative
She talks and is helped considerably bywomen, like her aunt, and the female rape crisis counselor who provides medication without any unnecessary commentary.
  Positive
But she is judged as a "victim" by all the men she encounters, a heavy-handed verdict that male creators Mitre and Lilnas carefully try to avoid.
  Negative
In fact,Mitre and Lilnas sometimes back off too much, and over-use expository dialogueto revealwhat Paulina is thinking and feeling.
  Negative
But even that complaint feels minor given how refreshing it is to watch a drama that is about a difficult subject that doesn't baby viewers, nor completely devolve into hippy-dippy "why can't we be friends" sermonizing.
  Negative
Violence stings in this film, as we see when Ciro rapes Paulina, or when Ciro attacks some of his friends.
  Negative
These scenes do not revolve around fetishistic close-ups, which is both a commendable and a glaring omission.
  Negative
On the one hand: finally, an adult take on sexual violence.
  Positive
On the other: it feels like Mitrecommitted to filming violence without having anything to saybeyond a general acknowledgment that these events occurred, and therefore cannot honestly be avoided.
  Negative
"Paulina" is, in that sense, worth seeing, even if its basic plot repeatedly stalls.
  Positive
It is a thoughtful movie, but not necessarily a fulfilling one.
  Positive
There's no cheap catharsis, or resolution for the viewer.
  Positive
There's also not a lot to emotionally engage with during multiple scenes where Paulina mulls over her options.
  Negative
Still, there ar some subtly moving performances, and righteously indignant speechifying.
  Positive
There is a lot to like about a movie where a woman gets to passionately, and eloquently explains why she is the mistress of her own destiny.
  Negative
I just wish that the humanism that Mitre, Lilnas, and their collaborators exhibit throughout "Paulina" were consistently engaging on a basic storytelling level.
  Negative
