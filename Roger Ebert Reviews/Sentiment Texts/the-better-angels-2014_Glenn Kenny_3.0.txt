There arent a whole lot of dyed-in-the-wool art movies that take North American history, let alone United States history, as their topics andor inspirations.
  Positive
Sure, there is a fair amount of Distinguished Cinema that does so, as in MerchantIvorys  Jefferson In Paris to name a more palatable example or  Roger Michells Hyde Park On Hudson to name a more indigestible one.
  Negative
But a movie of grand and enigmatic dimensions, with stunning visuals and an oblique approach to narrative?
  Very positive
The most outstanding example I can recollect at the moment is  Terrence Malicks   The New World, a retelling of the PocahontasJohn Smith affair in the form of an ecstatic meditation on nature and its corruption.
  Negative
This movie is another, and possibly more unlikely example.
  Neutral
It opens with a quote from Abraham Lincoln: All that I am, or hope to be, I owe to my angel mother.
  Negative
What follows, in austere, stately widescreen black-and-white, are views of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C..
  Negative
Then come more ecstatic, free-form, sunlight-dappled shots of a forest' a gritty-voiced narrator asks, You wanna know what kinda boy he was?
  Negative
The Better Angels would feel under the influence of Malick even if the viewer were completely unaware of the fact that its director, A.J. Edwards, was Malicks editor on To The Wonder, and that Malick executive-produced this film.
  Negative
The low-angle shots with the sunlight shining through trees as a buoyant human figure enters the frame from the right side, with Bruckner or Wagner or Dvorak music on the soundtrack' this is the sort of thing one associates with Malick.
  Positive
Edwards also applies a sometimes jarring cutting style, sometimes jumping frames within a single shot so that the old-time feeling of the rustic setting and characters is imbued with a you-are-watching-a-film apprehensive awareness.
  Positive
Its all very beautiful, and certainly evocative of a kind of Primal American Feeling.
  Positive
But whats the damn thing about?
  Negative
I can hear some of you asking about now, and thats where theres a sticking point.
  Negative
As suggested by the opening epigraph, the depiction of the Lincoln Memorial, the loaded question of the movies first spoken words, and of course by the title, theres something to do with Abraham Lincoln.
  Positive
More than something, as it happens' its a story of young Lincolns life, not young as in  John Ford young, but young as in not even ten years old.
  Negative
The movie is set in the period in which Lincolns family moved from Kentucky to Indiana, a period that also saw a tentative beginning to Lincolns schooling and ended in a tragedy that readers familiar with their Lincoln history will know right away but the reveal of which here, in the context of this film review, would constitute oh, the indignity of it all!
  Negative
a spoiler.
  Negative
Or would it?
  Neutral
To tell you the truth, The Better Angels, as pictorially beautiful and emotionally evocative as it is, is so bereft of conventional narrative momentum that you have to consider it a miracle it got made.
  Positive
While its simulation of a pocket of past life is appropriately austere, and very beautiful, its story sense is such that it makes Bressons Four Nights Of A Dreamer look like The Kennel Murder Case.
  Negative
The minimalist dialogue contains questions such as Wheres your spirit?
  Negative
How do you know its there?
  Neutral
and thats in keeping with a certain inchoate Transcendentalist philosophy the movies perspective seems to strive for, but seekers of a meat-and-potatoes Lincoln story are likely to find the enterprise frustrating, manly gestures of  Jason Clarke as Lincolns dad notwithstanding.
  Negative
Brit Marling plays Lincolns mother, and succeeds in making the viewer unaware of her indie-it-person status.
  Negative
Theres much to admire in this genuine American art film, but in some respects the things that are most daring about it wind up undermining its mission.
  Positive
