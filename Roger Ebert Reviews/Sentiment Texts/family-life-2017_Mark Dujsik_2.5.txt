The key question is whether or not we can sympathize with the main character of "Family Life."
  Negative
The filmmakers certainly believe we should, since the movie primarily assumes his perspective, save for the introduction and the coda.
  Neutral
That's the trick.
  Neutral
Directors  Alicia Scherson and  Cristin Jimnez, as well as screenwriter  Alejandro Zambra, assume a point of view akin to the protagonist's headspace what he's thinking, why he thinks it, how what he thinks and why he thinks that way translate into action.
  Very negative
For a while, Martn  Jorge Becker is mostly a man of inaction.
  Negative
He doesn't do much of anything, and that's the way he would prefer it.
  Negative
He has been offered a brief job of housesitting for his second cousin, the son of his late father's cousin, while the cousin is away in Paris with his family for a few months.
  Positive
The relatives have only met a couple of times in adulthood once while out for drinks with Martn's now ex-girlfriend and at his father's funeral.
  Negative
Martn hasn't recovered from either the breakup or the death of his father yet.
  Negative
It makes his cousin Bruno  Cristin Carvajal think that Martn is "weird."
  Neutral
Bruno's wife Consuelo  Blanca Lewin finds him intriguing, because he seems to walk around as if there's a dark cloud hanging over him.
  Neutral
The movie's introductory section follows the life of Bruno and Consuelo for reasons that become a bit clearer during the epilogue.
  Negative
What is clear from the start, though, is how capable Jimnez, Scherson and Zambra are at illuminating the day-to-day worries that point at the deeper concerns of their characters.
  Negative
The movie opens with Bruno and Consuelo in the midst of secretive sex in the living room of their upscale, two-story home.
  Negative
Their daughter Sofi Adara Casassus is asleep upstairs, and in the low-key afterglow, Consuelo worries that their daughter might have heard them.
  Negative
There's something amiss with the couple.
  Positive
It took some convincing for Bruno to agree to the trip to Paris.
  Neutral
Sofi acts happy about the "vacation," as she sees it, but the girl leaves an angry note on her bedroom wall saying that she hates her mother, her "ugly father," and Paris.
  Negative
When Martn arrives to go over the details of housesitting duties, Bruno points out that there are a few attractive neighbors that the cousin could seduce.
  Negative
He later tells Martn that it was a joke, but that's only after Martn asks if his cousin has slept with any of them.
  Negative
No one in the family openly discusses any of this, although, after a few drinks, Martn is open about how he was in love with his ex, how he hasn't really gotten over her, and how he's depressed about his father's death.
  Negative
This honesty is "weird" to Bruno, but Consuelo sees it with a bit of romanticism.
  Positive
For their part, Jimnez and Scherson find something of a middle ground between those two perceptions of the character.
  Positive
Much of the first section of Martn's stay at the house involves him lounging around naked for a portion, inspecting the owners' possessions in the case of Bruno's clothes, trying them on, and scanning photographs of his extended family in a photo album zooming in on his face as a boy until the eyes are a blur.
  Negative
He is not a happy man, although we later garner the extent of how unhappy he might be in the way he edits those pictures.
  Negative
A story emerges when the family cat goes missing and Martn meets Pachi  Gabriela Arancibia over some confusion with flyers in town her dog went missing, too.
  Negative
A sensual but pragmatic love affair begins between the two.
  Positive
Pachi, a single mother to a son played by Lucas Miranda, doesn't want anything serious at first.
  Negative
Martn is happy to oblige, too, at first.
  Positive
He is, after all, pretending to be someone else in this relationship, and that's where the sympathy levels for the character begin to diminish.
  Negative
There's some truth in his deception: He says he isn't quite over an ex, although the ex-girlfriend has become an ex-wife, and it's Consuelo's picture that he uses to represent her he tries to kiss Consuelo as she's leaving for the airport.
  Negative
As one would expect, the relationship becomes more than just sex.
  Negative
Martn begins spending time with Pachi's son.
  Positive
There's plan for him to meet her family.
  Neutral
A lovely shot has the trio Martn, Pachi and her son sitting in domestic tranquility with a returned pet.
  Positive
On his face, Martn has an expression that could, finally, be called content.
  Negative
It's based on a lie, obviously, and the movie gradually shows how deep that lie is for Martn.
  Negative
For all of the work that the filmmakers do to help us understand Martn's motives for the deception not to mention Becker, whose performance is quite good, there's an important piece missing, though: Pachi's perspective.
  Negative
Part of the trick in seeing this story from Martn's point of view is that she becomes something of a generically "strong" woman, who has handled such behavior before and surely can handle it again.
  Negative
It's not until the final two shots of "Family Life," in which two women share a silent moment of confounded acknowledgment, that the filmmakers recognize that Martn's behavior, as understandable as it may be from his perspective, has a price for others.
  Negative
