To paraphrase  Bill Murrays famous line from  Tootsie, the long-delayed Tulip Fever is one nutty th century melodrama.
  Negative
It offers curious viewers a very horny,  Titanic-esque forbidden romance, a subplot involving someone pretending to be pregnant for nine months, and then juxtaposes that with in-depth sequences about the tulip trade in s Amsterdam.
  Negative
There are numerous, ridiculous twists that Tulip Fever delivers with a completely straight face, and it's all dressed up with a moody Not Your Usual Period Film look.
  Negative
But Tulip Fever reveals itself to be so nutty because it explicitly believes its not crazy, rambling through its odd events and obsessions without an ounce of th century kitsch.
  Negative
Alicia Vikander stars as Sofia, an orphan who was essentially purchased by a wealthy widower named Cornelis Sandvoort  Christoph Waltz to become a baby factory, but has failed that horrifying purpose for the last three years.
  Negative
Unprotesting, she becomes imprisoned by the shame of not doing what she was expressly made to do, praying with her husband while looking miserable during any of their attempts to conceive.
  Negative
Its a strong contrast to the true, actually sexy love experienced by housekeeper Maria  Holliday Grainger and the handsy fishmonger Willem Jack OConnell, who heat up the kitchen with dry humping and whatnot.
  Positive
One day, Cornelis hires a struggling painter named Jan Van Loos  Dane DeHaan to create a portrait of him and his wife, a type of way to build legacy while waiting for Sophia to give him an heir.
  Negative
Jan and Sophia quickly fall for each other, which leads to DeHaan glaring at Vikander, then some movie-ready love-making and also a shared obsession that might soon get them found out by Cornelis.
  Negative
When Willem suddenly disappears comically fast and Maria is mortified to find out that shes pregnant, Maria and Sophia create a plan to benefit each others needs, while eventually cutting Cornelis out of the picture.
  Negative
Sophia will just stuff a pillow under her dress for nine months while Maria carries a baby that Cornelis thinks is his.
  Negative
It's a ridiculous, incredibly fallible scheme and the movie never acknowledges that.
  Negative
Oh yes, the tulips.
  Neutral
In this movies time period, tulips have become a hot commodity, for ways mentioned in a visually intricate animated opening sequence, but lost within the numerous boisterous scenes where characters are bidding on bulbs in a sweaty hall that looks like a brothel.
  Negative
But various characters in this story get caught up in the business that provides both opportunity and heartbreak, in a way that is indeed original but muddled.
  Negative
This also doesnt include other characters, who have their own appearances that make Tulip Fever even stranger.
  Negative
Tom Hollander plays a creepy but genuinely helpful OBGYN named Dr. Sorgh'  Zach Galifianakis is Jans sidekick, expressly used for glaring comedic beats about his character being clueless or drunk' even  Judi Dench appears in this movie as a nun who manages the orphanage that provided Sophia and now grows flowers.
  Negative
Keeping in check with this film's strange way of using people, Dench is hardly on screen despite giving an emblematically stoic performance.
  Negative
Director  Justin Chadwicks film feels narratively busy but moves slowly, struggling to make much sense in the process.
  Negative
Despite Chadwicks clear investment in honoring the hormones of a stuffy period like  Hysteria before it and in putting a spotlight on the history of tulip trading, the story never comes together.
  Negative
Instead, it drags you one way, and then another, and often clumsily bridges over missing narrative beats with goofy ADR or making you catch up.
  Negative
As the contemplative and frozen Sophia, Vikander channels the presence she had in  Ex Machina where she played an android understanding her actions and wanting to break free.
  Negative
Its a sincere performance as someone trying to find happiness, and makes you realize how perfect shed be in the domestic imprisonment of a Douglas Sirk-style drama which Tulip Fever tries to be the th century version of, in a way.
  Positive
But the true MVP for this films motley crew of relatively earnest performances is Waltz, who creates the storys one ambitious idea that works in the movies favor.
  Positive
His Cornelis character is a babbling cuckold whos given a montage that documents his bedtime urinating habits, and refers to his penis, self-deprecatingly, as a little soldier.
  Negative
And yet Waltz is so intricate in this role that he comes off as more pathetic, if not sympathetic, than his misogynist ever should.
  Positive
In turn, it kills the romance underneath Sophia, Maria and Jan's scheme.
  Negative
The story just does not have the nuance to explore the ideas of cruelty and shame that are underneath many of the characters actions.
  Negative
Chadwick continues to treat period pieces as more then ornaments, and theres some blood pumping in this movie even visually.
  Positive
The usage of handheld camerawork during intimate moments goes a long way to create an immediacy for stuffy period, especially as everything happens in creaky rooms splashed with daylight.
  Negative
And for a movie that relishes the drab surroundings of Amsterdam and its inhabitants, its a movie that has a clear ability to visually pop, like the creamy, pure colors of the tulips or the blue dress that Sophia wears as an sign of being a walking dream.
  Negative
But Chadwicks strong grasp on visual tone doesnt benefit the narrative.
  Positive
Tulip Fever eventually hurls itself into a semi-amusing void of feeling like it came from another planet, one where everyone is too crazy of a romantic for their own good, and tulips are God.
  Negative
Is this story a sexy, star-crossed romance?
  Neutral
A cruel tragedy about really dumb people?
  Negative
A very, very dry comedy?
  Negative
It is all plausible with Tulip Fever.
  Negative
But however you want to engage it, the film wilts right before your eyes.
  Negative
