Since the passing of this websites founder in , this website has reviewed nine films starring  Nicolas Cage.
  Negative
I have reviewed one-third of them.
  Neutral
No other critic on this website has reviewed more than one.
  Negative
Perhaps you remember the opening line of  Bob Dylans Idiot Wind.
  Neutral
If not, you can Google it.
  Negative
But never mind.
  Neutral
The point is, now that Im reviewing my FOURTH Nicolas Cage movie for this website, I sometimes do think someones got it in for me.
  Negative
However.
  Neutral
I cant complain too much, not only because nobody really cares anyway but also because this latest Nicolas Cage movie, The Trust, is actually a moderately entertaining heist movie featuring an animated and reasonably diverting Eccentric Cage Performance.
  Negative
The debut feature of brother filmmaking team Alex and  Benjamin Brewer, The Trust casts Cage as a seemingly earnest and beleaguered Las Vegas cop.
  Negative
Assembling evidence with his team at a crime scene, he observes This is a very interesting ashtray, before being called outside by a superior officer.
  Positive
Thinking his boss is ready to hear some exciting stuff about his evidence findings, hes disappointed to find out that the guy just wants him to take a John Deere vehicle off the police auction block so he can make a gift of it to his son-in-law.
  Negative
Las Vegas must be a very movie-friendly city to allow its Finest to be portrayed as such nincompoops.
  Negative
In any event, Cages Stone turns out to not be so honest as that, because upon finding a bail slip showing a certified-check payment on a , fee to spring a relative criminal nobody, he smells a rat andor a source of illicit cash.
  Negative
He inveigles his disillusioned, largely stoned-out colleague Waters into a little extra-curricular investigation.
  Negative
What they find a highly-protected vault overseen by drug dealers, or so it seems startles and entices them.
  Negative
Soon Stone is on the phone to Cologne, Germany, talking high-tolerance drill bits with experts, consulting his German phrasebook all the while.
  Negative
Things get a little less funny when they get to the spot where they hope to drill around the vaults security, and find the place occupied by not one but two bystanders.
  Negative
Not content to merely be brother filmmakers, the Brewers wear their Coen influence on their sleeves.
  Negative
Its not just the casting of Cage, but the attempted wryness of the dialogue You cant walk around dressed like a cop.
  Negative
But I AM a cop, and so on, the confident visual styling, and more.
  Positive
These elements are pretty entertaining as far as they go, especially when Cage is getting his groove on, as when his character tries to convince Waters that a lemon wedge drizzled with hot sauce is a genuine treat.
  Positive
But certain stuff falls flat: it might have seemed like a quirky move to cast  Jerry Lewis in the role of Cages father, but the -year-old icon is only in the film long enough for you to point to the screen and ask, Is that Jerry Lewis?
  Negative
And the movie gets a lot less interesting once it starts to go dark, so to speak, and the elements of the story that you had identified as red herrings earlier on turn out to be, yup, red herrings.
  Negative
At this point Cages performance has settled into a kind of forced oddness, as in his reading of the line, I have an idea.
  Negative
Its kind of  WACKY.
  Positive
He says it pretty much exactly as youd predict.
  Negative
