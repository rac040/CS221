Before you head to the comments section below to disagree, consider that this dissent comes courtesy of someone who bestowed four whopping stars upon its predecessor, a supremely original and consistently entertaining outing about resisting socially-enforced conformity.

I also havent really been truly fond of a big-screen Caped Crusader since  Michael Keatons inspired outside-the-box interpretation of the role.

When he sneered, Im Batman, it contained true menace.

When  Will Arnett throatily growls his lines in this Lego version, it is usually in the service of derisive mockery that only semi-regularly hits its mark.

  Negative
Although Batman scores points for often beat-boxing rather than tweeting his self-praise.
  Neutral
But besides an implacable me-first disposition, the synthetically molded superhero and a certain White House dweller also have a financial patron in common: Treasury secretary nominee Steve Mnuchin, who earns an executive producer credit on this spoofy spinoff.
  Negative
Hmm.

Are you thinking what I am thinking about how they might just build that border wall namely, one Lego brick at a time?

Granted, I will never be mistaken for a diehard Batman fan.

I was more into Superman as a kid, mostly because of Lois Lane but I was a loyal admirer of the campy s Batman TV series referenced here via its na-na-na-na theme song, cheesy villains and the pop-art POWs!

Basically, those who are batty for this stuff will positively devour all the Easter eggs that whisk by.

Thats not to say I didnt find some pleasure in this aggressively frenzied comedic spin directed by  Chris McKay who worked as an animation co-directorsupervisor on the first Lego film on this most dour of comic-book heroes as it draws upon decades of Bat lore for its inside jokes no previous incarnation of the Dark Knight is left un-zinged, including an obscure baddie known as the Condiment King and cultural references that zip by faster than any souped-up Bat vehicle.

Instead, Batman hurtfully claims that Superman is his greatest enemy before admitting, I am fighting a few different people  I Iike to fight around.

Action scenes consume most of the film's -minute running time, with a surplus of villainy summoned from not just the DC Comics universe but also home studio Warner Bros. warehouse of baddies including the Eye of Sauron, Voldemort, King Kong, Gremlins, Godzilla and the Wicked Witch of the West and her Flying Monkeys.
  Negative
There is plenty of visual razzle-dazzle, to be sure, but not much else.

The sequence that I most enjoyed, however, was a rare quiet and semi-serious one when Batman returns to his near-empty secluded compound that occupies an entire island and reheats the lobster thermidor thoughtfully left in the fridge by manservant Alfred a fine  Ralph Fiennes.
  Positive
Dressed in a silk robe but still in his mask, Batman accidentally punches in  minutes instead of  glad to know I am not the only one who does this and dines in solo silence before he heads to his Wayne Manor movie theater to giggle over the romantic interludes of such relationship flicks as  Jerry Maguire and Marley amp' Me.

  Negative
Certainly, the five writers who pieced together this pastiche of Batmania have done their homework.
  Neutral
But the story peters out long before it concludes with what else?
  Negative
a dance number.
  Neutral
I guess I should semi-applaud any movie that employs  Mariah Carey to provide the voice for Gothams pearl-wearing and pant-suited mayor.
  Negative
But when it comes to humorous satire, it is the movie that has to sing even while it stings.
