Horror-comedy"YogaHosers,"  Kevin Smith's latest scatological experiment, takes elements from his previous movies and stitches them together to form tedious Franken-gags.
  Negative
The snarky convenience store clerks of" Tusk," Smith's misconceived but relatively straight-facedhorror flick, return to stop a decades-old conspiracy hatched by a Canadian Nazi and his ... sentient Nazi sausages.
  Negative
That may sound like a novel premise, but in Smith's infirm hands, it sinks beneath the weight of schticky jokes about Canada They all say "aboot" and eat "Pucky Charms!"
  Negative
, Nazis they all say "Nein," and "Wunderbar!"

"YogaHosers" is tiring, and not because it's dumb or inherently obnoxious.
  Negative
No, as RogerEbert.com's resident Kevin Smith apologist, it pains me to say this, but: this movie should have been made by someone with more discipline.
  Negative
"YogaHosers" starts off simply enough: inseparable teenagersColleen C. and Colleen M. Lily-Rose Depp, and Harley Quinn Smith, respectively, daughters of Johnny andKevin are in tenth grade, and want to attend a twelfth grade party hosted by handsome senior Hunter Calloway  Austin Butler and his gross friend Gordon Greenleaf  Tyler Posey.
  Very negative
But Colleen C.'s dad  Tony Hale is going on a vacation with his cattygirlfriend Tabitha  Natasha Lyonne.
  Negative
So the Colleens have to mindthe Eh--Zed, Canada's answer to the Quick Stop convenience store you see in " Clerks."
  Negative
And while the girls pine for Hunter, murderous, butt-invadingNazi bratwursts or "Bratzi" infiltrate the Eh--Zed.
  Negative
Yes, I said "butt-invading Nazi bratwursts."
  Negative
And no, I'm not shaking my head while I type this.
  Negative
Nazi meat-stuffs that sodomize their victims to death are not the worst of this film's problems.
  Negative
Sono, Smith isn't an utter moron for coming up this premise.
  Negative
It could have been quite funny.
  Positive
In fact, if the creators of "South Park" had done it, "YogaHosers" might have been hysterical.
  Negative
Unfortunately, Smith made "YogaHosers," a reality that sinks in with every sloppy joke, scattershot line-reading and uninspired wide-shot.
  Very negative
That's right, even basic photographic coverage feels amateurish in Smith's films, a signature trait I must reluctantly admit to ignoring with some of his recent output.
  Negative
His main strength as a filmmaker and storyteller is his tendency of presenting a personal or just singular worldview.
  Positive
Say what you want about "Tusk," but there is not only a bizarre premise that holds together but a genuinely weird atmosphere, long enough for it to become clear that Smith has no idea where he's going.
  Negative
"Tusk" is disappointing, but it at least tried to do something new.
  Negative
"YogaHosers" feels like they took the wrong elements out of "Tusk" and spun-it-off into misguided schtick.
  Negative
I keep saying "schtick" because that is exactly what Smith movies become when he runs out of ideas.
  Positive
Compare "Clerks" with "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back" and you'll see exactly what I mean: Smithtook some ofhis favorite parts about his bestmovie Jay and Silent Bob and structured a whole movie out of their misadventures.
  Positive
The fact that his daughter and co-star Johnny Depp's daughter are the leads of the film gives some indication as to why Smith chose to make a whole movie about the heroines of "YogaHosers."
  Negative
What it doesn't explain is why he wasn't able to translate his enthusiasm into a compelling story, funny jokes or even some interesting camerawork.
  Negative
Oh, right, that's because nobody but diehardsexpect anything from Smith movies anymore.
  Positive
Seemingly aware of this, he's been making the most of his creative freedom.
  Positive
But with that freedom comes an unfortunate habit of never reining in his worse ideas.
  Negative
Case in point: Depp's Guy LaPointe, a bumbling,Inspector Clouseau-type man-hunter with a phallic nose, and an indecipherably goofy accent.
  Negative
This time, Depp's accent isn't the weakest part about his sub-Catskills schtick it's his multiplying facialbirthmarks, which keep changing locations between takes.
  Negative
This is the kind of joke that's only funny for the people involved in the making of "YogaHosers."
  Negative
See also: most of "YogaHosers."
  Positive
I can't judge "YogaHosers" too harshly, really.
  Negative
The worst thing it did is bore me.
  Very negative
Smith's not wrong to think that Harley Quinn Smith and Lily-Rose Depp make a good time.
  Negative
The scene where they do dueling impressions of Christian Bale's Batman is especially funny.
  Positive
Butthese twocan't carry a movie yet, not without stronger screwball banter.I don't really want to tell Smith to stop following his gut instincts, since that's what makes his movies so compelling.
  Negative
But, well, if he's out there reading this: hire a script doctor, and get a director-friend to give you a hand on your next project.
  Negative
You're not the worst thing to happen to contemporarycinema.
  Negative
But man, you need to be a lot better.
