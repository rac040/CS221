Terry Gilliam, the onetime Monty Python animator turned influential filmmaker, is incapable of putting a dull image onscreen.
  Negative
"The Zero Theorem," his first science fiction movie since 's "Twelve Monkeys," is a visual dazzler on the level we'd expect from the director.
  Negative
As always, he fills the screen with intricately choreographed tableaus that have that ferociously jumbled quality: there are usually four or five things going on in each shot, and they're always related to the film's main themes.
  Negative
The cast, which includes  Christoph Waltz, Melanie Theirry,  Matt Damon and  David Thewlis, is world-class.
  Negative
It's hard to imagine how any individual part of the physical production could be improved.
  Negative
But the movie's allegory-steeped plot   in which Waltz's,Qohen Leth, who "crunches entities" for a technology company called Mancom, tries to solve a theorem that'll reveal if life has meaning   is a case of "close, but no cigar."
  Negative
And no matter how feverishly Gilliam directs and no matter how enthusiastically his actors act, the whole thing remains too, er, theoretical as if its main purpose is to demonstrate or disprove certain propositions rather than invest us in the hero's quest for happiness and enlightenment.
  Negative
Knowing Gilliam's humanism, this seems unlikely, but that's what comes through.
  Neutral
Screenwriter Richard Pushin was reportedly inspired by the book of Ecclesiastes, but the plot seems equally influenced by "Waiting for Godot," "" and the collected works of  Franz Kafka the latter two sources shaped Gilliam's " Brazil" as well.
  Positive
Even though it was written directly for the screen, "Zero Theorem" often feels like a stage play that was adapted without being fully remained as a movie.
  Negative
It's visually energetic but ultimately feels constrained and repetitious.
  Negative
The main locations are Mancom headquarters, a nightclub filled with writhing revelers, and the hero's apartmentlaboratory, a cavernous space with a black-and-white chessboard-style floor and smoky shafts of light streaming through windows.
  Positive
The cathedral-like quality of Quohen's place befits the spiritual pilgrim who occupies it.
  Positive
Quohen has been depressed and angry for a long time because he keeps hoping for a phone call that will assure him that life has meaning shades of "Godot"' when it finally arrives, he muffs it and spends the rest of the movie beating himself up.
  Negative
Quohen is reassigned to work at home by the company's psych evaluator, Dr Shrink-Rom  Tilda Swinton, an artificially intelligent computer program who simulates warmth and involvement.Swinton is hilariously intense here' between this role and her bucktoothed-Ayn-Rand routine in " Snowpiercer," the Hugos should give her a Most Valuable Player award.
  Negative
Quohen gets diagnosed with ailment after ailment and eventually dons a body suit that connects him directly to the Internet, making his physical being virtual.
  Negative
It's red and green, with a hoodie cap like a droopy Alpine horn that tapers into braided, vaguely intestinal cables.
  Negative
When Quohen wears the suit while sitting at his terminal typing, the image suggests a porn-addicted Christmas elf.
  Negative
Other characters drift in and out of the story, alleviating or increasing the hero's irritability and spiritual malaise.
  Negative
The curvy blondBainsley  Mlanie Thierry rescues Quohen at a party when he nearly chokes on an olive, and proves responsible for getting him reassigned to work at home, then keeps reappearing in his life, eventually providing him with his signature elf suit and then being revealed as a secret Internet striptease artist.
  Negative
Many of the characters evoke indelible players from Gilliam's "Brazil": there's a Walter Mitty or Winston Smith-type wise-yet-meek everyman the hero, an obnoxious mediocrity of a supervisor David Thewlis, and a blandly intimidating boss Matt Damon, whose character is identified only as Management, and whose natty suits, owlish eyeglasses, grey hair and dulcet voice make him seem like Peter Bogdanovich's all-powerful kid brother.
  Very negative
There are some twists and turns in the plot, all having to do with the true meaning and purpose of the Zero Theorem.
  Positive
At the end, the mysteries are laid out for us methodically, as if we're seeing the philosophical version of a drawing-room mystery where the murderer is the Frankensteinian post-capitalist society we've all gotten way too comfortable with, and the victim is the human soul.
  Negative
I wish, however, that the characters were allowed to be as well as to represent, if that makes sense.
  Negative
Gilliam's other films, even the bad ones, all managed to balance the need to deliver aphorisms and lessons against the obligation to involve us in the characters' plights.
  Negative
Every character in this movie remains stubbornly and elusively abstract.
  Negative
We know what everybody stands for, but we never really know them.
  Negative
After a while you start to miss the aching humanity of  Sam Lowry in "Brazil" or the lovers in "Twelve Monkeys," or the exquisitely fragile energy of  Robin Williams in Gilliam's " The Fisher King."
  Neutral
The movie's at its most engaging when it's just showing us the world that causes Quohen such distress.
  Positive
An early scene in which the hero leaves his abode and tries to walk along a city thoroughfare while a video ticker on the side of a building tracks him with tailored sales pitch is a marvelous comment on how technology turns every environment into a retail outlet, and every person into a target of opportunity.
  Positive
It's like that moment in " Minority Report" where  Tom Cruise walks through a mall while ads chirp at him.
  Neutral
There are some exquisitely blocked and executed long takes, and a virtual-fantastical interlude on a tropical beach that ranks with the best scenes Gilliam has directed.
  Positive
In its better moments, "Zero Theorem" does seem like the work of a brilliantly cranky cartoonist who's spent years obsessing over what the world has become, then finally sat down, opened a sketchbook and started drawing.
  Negative
The problem is, once you've watched "Zero Theorem," you'd rather go look at the sketchbook.
  Negative
