The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.
  Negative
With that great opening line, an obsession began for millions of readers of  Stephen Kings series of books that would eventually be known as The Dark Tower.
  Positive
The first book was actually called The Gunslinger, and it was a relatively small volume of brilliant sci-fifantasy that used iconic imagery to begin the crafting of a world that would become as rich as those created by George R. R. Martin or J.R.R Tolkien.
  Positive
Over the next few books The Drawing of the Three, The Wastelands, and Wizard and Glass King did some of his best writing the series would actually stretch to seven books and a series of comics, but its the initial quartet that holds a special place in my heart.
  Negative
I only mention all of this to place the failure of the long-delayed The Dark Tower in the right perspective: this isnt just a mediocre movie although it is most definitely that it is a wasted opportunity to fulfill the promise of that opening line from  years ago.
  Negative
Plagued by reshoots and dogged by rumors of poor test screenings, The Dark Tower once looked like it would be one of the more notable failures of .
  Negative
Honestly, I kind of wish it was.
  Negative
As is, its more forgettable than loathsome, the kind of movie that occasionally rubs salt in your wounds by reminding you what could have been, but mostly just dissipates from memory as it's playing.
  Negative
The two leads here  Idris Elba and  Matthew McConaughey work just fine in these iconic roles, and you just want to pick them up and put them in a better movie, one that doesnt seem stuck in the valley between trying to satisfy hardcore fans of the series and the moviegoers who have never heard of Roland and Walter.
  Negative
By trying to do both, the movie ends up doing neither.
  Negative
The problems start immediately.
  Neutral
Someone probably thought that making Roland, the title character of the first book, the lead of the first film wouldnt satisfy a wide enough demographic.
  Positive
And Hollywood is obsessed with stories of teenagers who discover their bad dreams or hidden secrets are actually the keys to the salvation of the universe.
  Negative
So, instead of the origin story of Roland which will apparently now be told in a television series, also starring Elba, our protagonist here is really Jake Chambers  Tom Taylor, an essential character in the books reimagined here as a troubled New York teen without much of a real personality.
  Negative
As with almost everyone in this film, hes a device, a way to push the exposition forward to meet a contractually-mandated running time.
  Negative
Heres what we learn about the movie version of Jake, who is basically like the kid reading "The Neverending Story" in that he constantly tries to explain to the audience what's going on.
  Neutral
Jake has prophetic visions of both the Gunslinger Roland Elba and the Man in Black Walter  McConaughey.
  Neutral
He also has visions of a massive tower, which we learn is basically keeping the order of the universe.
  Positive
Walter wants to destroy this tower, and he knows that theres a child out there with the power to help him do so.
  Positive
Of course, that child is Jake, who it turns out has the same power as the young man at the center of  The Shining.
  Negative
He can read minds and other such things that Walter will harness to blow up the tower.
  Positive
The Dark Tower is filled with references for King nuts, including, among others, a moment where Roland glances behind a pin-up poster while looking for an exit  The Shawshank Redemption and the numbers  above a portal.
  Positive
Did I mention the portals?
  Neutral
I got distracted.
  Positive
Its easy to do so with this movie.
  Positive
Roland, Walter, and eventually Jake cross between worlds through portals.
  Neutral
Its not long before Jake and Roland team up, but Jake questions whether or not his new gun-toting pal is going to help him save the tower or if he just wants vengeance against the man in black.
  Negative
A few other characters flit around the fringe of this thin piece of storytelling, but its essentially a three-character piece.
  Negative
And two of those characters are actually pretty well defined.
  Positive
Elba brings a nice gravity to Roland that fits the character well, a combination of a man haunted by the ghosts of his past and driven to do whats right to avenge them.
  Very positive
And McConaughey dances on the edge of hamming it up in the villain role, reining it in just enough that one can see how well he could have been utilized with a better script and vision for the project.
  Positive
Because thats where this tower crumbles.
  Negative
The Dark Tower is hollow.
  Negative
It is soulless.
  Very negative
It is a film that never quite figured out what it wanted to be, and so elected to be nothing much at all.
  Negative
Worst of all, its clearly been chopped up by those reported reshoots and test screening edits.
  Negative
Theres a scene with a demon in a house that just ends and much of the final act material features a Jake who looks a lot closer to puberty than when the movie began.
  Negative
Weird humorous bits feel like they have been spliced in, trying to find as big an audience as possible.
  Negative
And while some may criticize Stephen Kings more populist works, thats a charge that could never be lobbied at The Dark Tower.
  Negative
These books had vision.
  Negative
They created worlds.
  Neutral
They used iconic imagery to explore timeless themes.
  Positive
The Dark Tower plays it so safe and takes so few risks that its greatest sin is in being the one thing those formative books never were for so many people: forgettable.
  Negative
