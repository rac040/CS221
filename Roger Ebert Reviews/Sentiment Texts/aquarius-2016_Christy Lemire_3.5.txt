At first.
  Neutral
But as the developers crank up the pressure on her, she remains steadfast and responds in kind.

And in a prelude to her present-day story, set in , we see the woman whose fierce spirit clearly courses through her: Tia Lucia  Thaia Perez, an independent beauty whos surrounded by family and friends as she celebrates her  th birthday.
  Positive
The director also creates a vivid sense of place in just a few rooms of Claras condo and the streets surrounding her building' a large poster for  Stanley Kubricks  Barry Lyndon hangs in the dining room, and carefully chosen songs by Queen and a variety of musical influences punctuate key moments.

And the climactic conclusion may seem too bold compared to the understated, intimate tone Mendonca Filho establishes throughout the rest of the film.
  Negative
But boy, is it satisfying.
  Positive
