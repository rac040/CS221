I suppose as a longtime fan of Universal monster movies and other forms of classic horror, as well as being, you know, an old man, I can be forgiven for having hoped that this newfangled origin story of a fabled monster maker would be something not entirely awful.
  Negative
Call me a nave old man.
  Neutral
Directed by  Paul McGuigan of  Lucky Number Slevin, which should have tipped me off a little from a screen story and script by  Max Landis of whom it can be said, at the very least, that horror appreciation runs in his family, what with his father having made An American Werewolf In London, Victor Frankenstein is, despite bravura performances from committed young leads  Daniel Radcliffe and James McAvoy, all kinds of obnoxious and pointless.
  Negative
It begins with Radcliffes Igor narrating that theres a story we all know, but that the story hes about to tell is different  and yes, I said Igor.
  Negative
Radcliffes at-first-nameless character is introduced as a much-abused circus hunchback whos also, get this, a self-taught expert in anatomy and biology.
  Negative
I know, right?
  Neutral
He pines for circus acrobat Lorelei  Jessica Brown Findlay, and when she suffers a fall, he and med student Victor Frankenstein visiting the circus for, um, spare animal parts it turns out perform a reviving miracle on her  and thus a bond is formed.
  Negative
Victor abducts the future Igor from his sideshow captors, in a scene that brings to mind a Guy Ritchie " Sherlock Holmes" movie, only not as good yes, you read that right, only not as good, and installs him in his lab, the better to assist him in his ambitious, perhaps mad, schemes.
  Negative
Landis script is extremely knowing and endlessly allusive.
  Positive
The Frankenstein here is  Mary Shelleys but his backstory includes a brother, Henry, which is the name of the character played in  James Whales Frankenstein from .
  Neutral
A police inspector tracking down Victor and his new pal gets an origin story of his own, one that puts him in line to become the Lionel Atwill character if this movie becomes a franchise, which we ought pray it does not.
  Negative
For all the enthusiasm brought to bear, and again, despite the brio of the young cast McAvoy makes his lets create life speeches with spittle-projecting eagerness, the movies a bloody mess, and a needlessly loud one as well.
  Negative
