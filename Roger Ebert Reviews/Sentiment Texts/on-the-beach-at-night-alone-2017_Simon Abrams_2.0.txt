The inert Korean drama"On the Beach At Night Alone" is a prime example of why personal art isn't necessarily good art.
  Negative
Writerdirector  Sang-soo Hong " Right Now, Wrong Then," " The Day He Arrives" has taken his real life extra-marital affair with actressfrequent collaborator Min-hee Kim, and created a painful series of talking points that never coheres into a coherentdrama.
  Negative
This is especially disappointing sinceHong's films generally rely onhis viewers' ability to recognizepatterns within pointedly similar narrative episodes.
  Negative
A typical Hong characterperforms the same actions over and over again, with minor, but noticeably different results.
  Negative
Unfortunately, thedrama in"On the Beach atNight Alone" isn't so involving.
  Negative
Scenes ofnaturalistic small talk are fine enough, but Hong's drama grinds alongwhenevercharacters start to declaim, or make veiled proclamationsabout marriage and personal freedom.
  Neutral
Watching this film feels like running into a depressed, drunk friend who can'tstop himself fromyellingabout how terrible his life is, andhow much hurt he's causing others.
  Negative
You feel bad for your buddy, but after a certain point, hoo, man, look at the time, gotta run!
  Positive
"On the Beach at Night Alone" exemplifies all of the worst tendencies of Hong's films without many of his better qualities.
  Negative
It'sa typical Hong movie in the sense that Hong is concerned with awoman's vaguely defined sense ofindependence, and a couple of men'sgrowing irrelevance.
  Negative
"On the Beach at Night Alone" is alsovery much like Hong's other films in that it's unmistakably told from a man's point-of-view.
  Positive
The words Hong puts in Kim's mouth may, in fact, reflect a keen insight into his lover's feelings.
  Positive
But, outside of that context, Kim's character, anaimless actressnamedYoung-hee, oftenrationalizesdeeply personal, and painful feelings--on Hong's behalf.
  Negative
Young-hee spends the first third of "On the Beach at Night Alone" talking circles around her mild-mannered friend Jeeyoung Young-hwa Seo.
  Neutral
Almost everyone of Jeeyoung and Young-hee's conversations concernthe latter woman's romantic affair with a married man.
  Negative
Young-hee seems resigned to this situation, so she only speaks passionately about this relationship within the abstract:everybody should have the right to independence, and happiness, or variations thereof become a common speechifying theme.
  Negative
This is probablybecause Hong's wife has, in real life,refused to grant him a divorce.
  Positive
So now he promotes his affair with Kim as much as possible in a vain ongoing attempt at getting his unhappy spouse to change her mind.
  Negative
"On the Beach at Night Aloneseems to enter a superficially denser thicket of meta-textuality at around the -minute mark, when the film'send credits prematurelyroll.
  Negative
Young-hee wakes up in a movie theater.
  Neutral
And for a moment, it seems like the suffocatingly myopic nature of Young-hee's man problems are a little more sensible.
  Negative
This movie is an open-ended pleafrom Hong to his audience:don't judge me too harshly, I know I'm hurting my loved ones, but what else can I do?
  Negative
This partly explains the mysterious unnamed stranger in a black over-coat whoshadows Young-hee, like the personification of Hong, I mean Young-hee's guilty conscience, or maybe just her inability to deny the resentment and anger she's feeling about her current situation.
  Negative
This man in black is the revenge of Hong's subconscious.
  Neutral
Too bad this movie is not about him.
  Negative
There are many minor flourishes, and points of interest in this film that might existingcompel Hong's fans--and maybe even viewerswho have never seen any of his other movies--to see "On the Beach at Night Alone."
  Positive
But the last hour of this film won't change their mind one way or the other.
  Negative
This chunk of the film primarily consistsof monotonous variations on earlier scenes.
  Negative
Characters talk around, but rarelydirectlyabout what's bothering them.
  Neutral
And eventually, after some coffee, cigarettes, and soju, they open up.
  Negative
At this point, you realize that Hong's characters'seeming non-chalance and declarative insistence onpersonal freedom stems from a deeplyprivate place that heonly wants totalk about in the abstract.
  Negative
BecauseHong's films are nothing if not a reflection of his personality.
  Negative
For example, their dialogue-intensive style often invites comparisonsto the vitalwork of French New Wave master  Eric Rohmer.
  Negative
This is a natural comparison since bothfilmmakers' respective bodies of work aredefined by discursive dialogue scenes about sex, ethics, and interpersonal responsibility.
  Negative
But "On the Beach at Night Alone" doesn't invite comparisons to Rohmer's films because ithas none of the wit, charm, or delicacy of Hong's superior films.
  Negative
Hong usually excels at an un-fussy,prickly-funny sort of humor that's often best expressed during grace-less, booze-fueled shouting matches.
  Positive
But even those scenes are dull and shrill in "On the Beach at Night Alone.
  Negative
"Hong has every right to express himself.
  Positive
Butthat doesn't necessarilymean that an authenticdeclaration of his personality is worth watching.
  Negative
