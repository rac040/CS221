Is it possible the sequels to  Cabin Fever and Hostel exist mostly to make the first films look better in comparison?
  Negative
Before horror nuts get defensive, I actually have some admiration for  Eli Roths brand of visceral horror but the sequels to his films have been remarkably horrendous enough to engender conspiracy theories.
  Negative
"You thought that was bad?
  Negative
Get a load of this."
  Negative
Cabin Fever  was reportedly taken out of the hands of  Ti West and the result was a Frankenmovie without much personality or reason to remember it.
  Negative
While that may have been forgettable, the same cant be said about Hostel III, a truly awful horror film with nary a redeeming value.
  Negative
Which brings us to Cabin Fever: Patient Zero, a film hitting theaters today and also available On Demand that promises to be a prequel to the first Roth film.
  Negative
And they are reportedly making another prequel too.
  Negative
How much do we have to praise Roths original films to make this stop?
  Negative
The first act of Cabin Fever: Patient Zero is so defiantly stupid that I imagine most who rent it or struggle through it in a theater wont care that theres actually some material in the final act that clicks, mostly due to some incredibly strong makeup work.
  Negative
Yes, horror fans, this is one of those movies in which we praise the makeup instead of the plotting, characters, or scares.
  Negative
Still, in an era of CGI overload, its nice to see a bit of practical work in a low-budget sequel that impresses and some of the viscera and melting body parts when the shit and everything else in the human body hits the fan in the final act of Patient Zero is impressively executed.
  Positive
Its just a shame that its in service of a movie that doesnt deserve it.
  Negative
At first, Patient Zero appears to be telling two stories, distinguished by strikingly different visual palettes.
  Negative
In one, Porter Sean Astin is taken prisoner by a group of doctors after he watches his son melt away in his arms from some unknown disease.
  Negative
Porter didnt die.
  Negative
Hes the key to the cure.
  Neutral
And so they trap him, keep him from civilization, and kind of torture him for reasons that are unclear other than there needs to be tension in this half of the movie.
  Negative
There certainly isnt any in the other half, which features characters and a plot that feels produced by a computer programmed with a Horror Clich Generator.
  Negative
A group of guys on a bachelor party weekend head off to what is essentially a deserted island.
  Negative
One of the more annoying dudes and his gal-pal who has tagged along go snorkeling and see that all the fish look like theyve gone through an oceanic blender.
  Negative
And then they start to form bumps, lesions and other things that we know will end in nastiness.
  Negative
I dont demand an inordinate amount of realism from my set-up acts for horror films but there is a line of what we should be willing to accept.
  Positive
These arent characters.
  Neutral
They arent people.
  Neutral
They barely even register as pawns to be fed to the horror machine.
  Negative
Most red shirts have more personality.
  Neutral
Worst of all, Cabin Fever: Patient Zero is a film without enough surprises.
  Negative
The very final - minutes have a bit of B-movie lunacy to keep this from the worst of the year and that make it more inherently interesting than Hostel III but everything that happens before that feels like its going through the motions.
  Negative
We know whats going to happen before it happens and predictability is anti-horror.
  Negative
When the pretty girl gets the plague, we know that her bro of a beau is going to try to have sex with her anyway and, well, we know how that will go.
  Negative
Call it a callback or homage to the first film if you want or just call it lazy.
  Negative
Better yet, dont call it anything at all.
  Positive
Just dont see it.
