By an odd coincidence,  has seen the release of two works that combine the talents of award-winning Hollywood actresses and acclaimed European filmmakers and include such elements as Americans in France working on the fringes of the entertainment industry, intense sibling bonds and a supernatural turn involving an obsession with contacting the spirit world and a brief glimpse of something that just might an honest-to-goodness apparition.
  Positive
The first was  Personal Shopper, the brilliant and haunting second teaming of director  Olivier Assayas and actress  Kristen Stewart that is one of the very best films to emerge this year.
  Very positive
Now comes Planetarium, a film that looks promising on paper but has no idea how to put its ingredients together.
  Neutral
The result is a bit of a mess and an oftentimes dull one at that, the kind of bland cinematic Euro-pudding that Miramax used to release in bulk back in the day.
  Very negative
Set in France in the years immediately preceding the onset of World War II, the film stars  Natalie Portman and  Lily-Rose Depp as Laura and Kate Barlow, a pair of American sisters who are barnstorming through Europe with a supernatural seance act in which Kate is the one contacting the spirits while Laura serves as the emcee and manager.
  Negative
After a performance in Paris, they are summoned to the estate of wealthy film producer Andre Korben  Emmanuel Salinger to perform a private seance in which something does happen.
  Negative
Andre is so taken with the results that he decides to make a movie inspired by it that not only star the sisters but will hopefully capture the image of an actual spirit on film.
  Negative
A screen test is shot and it turns out that while Kate is the one with the supernatural abilities, it is Laura who proves to be a natural in front of the camera.
  Positive
At first, Laura thinks the idea is absurd she isnt the one with the powers, after all but before long, she takes to her new career in ways that propel her into stardom and its usual trappings while at the same time separating her from her beloved sister.
  Negative
As for Kate, she goes off with Andre to an institute for the paranormal that he believes will help him recreate the earlier seance and film a genuine spirit with the aid of a collection of bizarre machinery straight out of a  Ken Russell movie.
  Negative
Andre plunges so much money into pursuing this obsession that his entire company teeters on the edge of bankruptcy.
  Negative
While all of this is going of, of course, the winds of war are beginning to blow, bad news under any circumstances but especially bad for Andre, who has a secret regarding his heritage that threatens everything.
  Negative
The film was co-written and directed by Rebecca Zlutowski and the opening scenes are intriguing as we are introduced to the two sisters and their bond and observe Kates otherworldly abilities and Lauras tentative first steps into the French film industry at a time when it was beginning to change to catch up with what was going on in the States.
  Positive
Before long, however, the narrative devolves into a series of subplots that, with one exception, do not work on their own, and which never pull together into a satisfying whole.
  Negative
Lauras adventures, which include a romantic entanglement or two, are profoundly uninteresting and never address her feelings about her separation from Kate.
  Very negative
The war element doesnt really come off either and just appears to have been tossed in at random to lend the story more dramatic heft.
  Negative
We even get a moment where everyone at a garden party stops to sing an inspirational rendition of La Marseillaise.
  Negative
The most interesting stuff involves Kate and Andre and all the strange gadgets employed to hopefully put a ghost on film but it winds up getting the short shrift to make room for the more conventionally melodramatic moments.
  Negative
Not even the star power that Zlutowski has deployed is enough to make Planetarium work.
  Neutral
Natalie Portman is a wonderful actress, to be sure, but her work here will not rank on any list of her greatest performances.
  Positive
She doesnt do anything bad, per se, but you never get a sense of her connecting with the material, and when her storyline takes a turn for the hokey later on, she cannot do anything to make it more palatable.
  Negative
The real standout performance, as it turns out, is the one delivered by Lily-Rose Depp, who nicely captures Kates ethereal qualities without going overboard.
  Very positive
Now she might have helped to save the film, but her character ends up being shunted off-screen for long stretches of time in the second half and her absence is keenly felt during that time.
  Negative
I have watched Planetarium twice now because I was curious to see if I might get more out of it with no expectations of all of its diverse pieces eventually coming together into a satisfying whole.
  Negative
As it turns out, I felt the same way about it the second time around as I did on my initial viewing.
  Negative
There are individual things scattered throughout that I liked Depps performance, a lovely scene where the guests at a stuffy dinner party dash outside to frolic in a surprise snowfall, the amusing behind-the-scenes look at the French film industry at a time of flux but they do not manage to compensate for a screenplay that never seems to have a clear idea of what it wants to say or how to say it.
  Negative
Planetarium was made by talented people and presumably with the best of intentions but other than serving as a showcase for Depp who is even better in another French import called The Dancer that will hopefully be headed here soon, all that it really manages to do is to renew ones appreciation for the comparable accomplishments of Personal Shopper.
  Positive
