How exactly did the makers of dismal Chinesewardrama "God of War" mess up a sure-fire premise like "th century samurai pirates vs.  Sammo Hung and the Chinese army?"
  Negative
For starters, the film's creators don't let Hung, the charismatic and highly influential martial arts star andchoreographer, do anything.
  Negative
Secondly and most importantly the film's screenwriters bog down their already arch characters with so much trivial background information that you can't help but emotionally check out long before we get to some thankfully decent action scenes.
  Negative
"GodofWar" is a spectacularly miscalculated historical epic, a movie that tries and fails to make the exploits of Chinese military hero General Jiguang Qi Wenzhuo Zhao exciting by way of endlessly explaining what he stood for, what political factors stood in his way, and why he never seemed tofight any damn samurai pirates.
  Negative
Seriously, what's doing with these samurai pirates, and why are they not the stars of this picture?
  Negative
Oh, that's right, because "GodofWar" feels like a stillborn attempt to do for General Qi what action star  Donnie Yen and the "Ip Man" series did for its title character, Bruce Lee's real-life teacher.
  Negative
General Qi is a strategist, so he spends much of his time wading through red tape that prevents him fromtraining soldiers, and defeating Japanese invaders.
  Negative
Qi is tasked with replacingaiding less-successful Chinese Commander Yu Hung, a well-regarded leader who keeps relentlessly attacking but never succeeds in annihilating a group of entrenchedpirates.
  Negative
So the higher-ups in the Ming dynasty regime ask Qi to do what Wu doesn't have the tactical skill to do: kill 'em all.
  Negative
There are a scattered handful of preliminary scenes where we see why Qi is such a big deal, like the one where he and Wu fight one-on-one in a prison cell, or the one where he outfoxes the pirates, and forces them to retreat.
  Negative
But for the most part, Qi's story is related through a series of conversations about everything but pirates.
  Negative
Qi struggles to raise an army.
  Negative
Then he tries to get the approval to train the army.
  Neutral
Then he does a little fighting.
  Neutral
Then he's yelled at for not capturing the Japanese pirates, which in turn leads Wu to being imprisoned.
  Neutral
After that,he tries to have a reasonable conversation with the people responsible for locking up his predecessor.
  Negative
Andhe yells at his men for being drunk while off-duty.
  Neutral
And things keephappening that have nothing to do with this movie's most exciting elements.
  Positive
We're talking about a movie that features an otherwise enjoyable battle sequence that prematurely concludes with an inter-title that assures us that most Japanese pirates died during the skirmish than Chinese soldiers did.
  Negative
Blocky dialogue scenes frequently serve to explain the many reasons why Qi was stymied by the Ming officials and soldiers that needed him most.
  Negative
There's so much expository dialogue in this film that I practically yelled at the screen when I saw how much blood the filmmakers used during fight scenes.
  Negative
This is how you overcompensate for such an otherwise lame, and pointedly bloodless movie?
  Negative
Realistically, the all-talk-and-precious-little-action approach that the makers of "GodofWar" adopted could have worked.
  Negative
There's nothing theoretically wrong with an action movie that tries to make you appreciate the lengths that its characters go to before they get to fighting.
  Negative
But "GodofWar" is not the film to sell it.
  Negative
There's a brittle, airless quality to its dialogue.
  Negative
Every character is treated with the utmost reverence.
  Negative
The lead pirate, an aspiring ronin who fights with honor, is too noble to be dislike.
  Negative
So is Qi's wife, who is simultaneously a capable soldier, but also a nag who gets upset at her husband for showing up late for dinner.
  Negative
Even Qi's soldiers, some of whom are portrayed as drunken embarrassments, ultimately prove themselves in battle.
  Negative
Again, a nationalistic action movie is not necessarily an impossible-to-swallow premise.
  Negative
For proof, just look at " The Great Wall," an exemplary bit of pop propaganda.
  Positive
The makers of "GodofWar" weren't nearly as inspired.
  Negative
Their film feels simultaneously padded, and starch-stiff, a weird stylistic clash that will make you wish you were watching a better high-concept film.
  Very negative
