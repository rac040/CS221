Presciently arriving at a time when tumultuous relations between U.S. police departments and communities of color have spawned a movement that proclaims Black Lives Matter,  Nick Broomfields documentary Tales of the Grim Sleeper introduces a countervailing term: NHI, or no human involved.
  Negative
That, we learn in this disturbing study of urban crime, is what Los Angeles police would write, in code to each other, on reports where the victims were minority drug abusers, prostitutes or gang members.
  Negative
Such social marginals, the cops evidently thought, almost deserved to be knocked off, and the community at large was better off without them.
  Negative
Why give investigations of their deaths the kind of seriousness the community would expect of more well-heeled andor white citizens?
  Negative
Such attitudes on the part of law enforcement officials, the film pointedly suggests, go a long way toward explaining how a man like Lonnie Franklin, Jr., could prey on lower-class women and kill more than a hundred of them over three decades, becoming perhaps the worst serial killer in U.S. history.
  Negative
Franklin was arrested, almost by accident, in , and his case is still wending its way through the courts.
  Negative
The judicial system thus has not delivered a final assessment of his culpability for a staggeringly long series of cold-blooded murders, usually involving torture.
  Negative
But the film makes a powerful case that his misdeeds were enabled by a culture in which many black lives did not, in fact, matter.
  Positive
According to new reports cited in the film, Franklin is suspected of killings that began in the s.
  Neutral
The media of later times dubbed him the grim sleeper because there was a long hiatus between those killings and others that came to light in more recent years.
  Negative
But was Franklin really inactive during that period or was law enforcement simply not paying attention?
  Negative
For viewers not familiar with the style of documentary filmmaking that Nick Broomfield has practiced in recent years, its akin to the anecdotal, first-person mode employed by  Ross McElwee,  Michael Moore and Morgan Spurlock.
  Negative
The British filmmaker often appears on-screen, here usually wearing a t-shirt and the headphones and tape recorder of a soundman.
  Negative
Offering occasional laconic commentary, he motors around looking for people who can give him information about the case and filming the places the crimes reportedly took place.
  Negative
Most of those locales are in the poor South Central area of Los Angeles, a world away from the swimming pools and mansions of Hollywood and Beverly Hills.
  Negative
The most vivid and important location is Lonnie Franklins home, a fairly ordinary ranch house with a decent-sized, fenced-in front yard and rear garage.
  Negative
Its here that, according to reports, Franklin would bring the women he picked up usually black prostitutes or drug addicts and engage in rough sex before killing them.
  Negative
How could he get away with it for so long?
  Neutral
Did others not know what he was up to?
  Neutral
As Broomfield circles through South Central, he encounters and interviews several black men who were Franklins friends.
  Neutral
They paint a picture of a guy who in many senses was fairly unremarkable.
  Neutral
Sure, he dealt in stolen cars, but he was decent and helped his neighbors.
  Positive
Some of these men knew of Franklins interest in picking up women, but this wasnt considered unusual, though he was married to a church-going woman who apparently spent a lot of time away from him.
  Negative
At least one man accompanied Lonnie when he took the women home, but claims he didnt know about the murders.
  Negative
Broomfield also talks with several women who knew Franklin and his milieu.
  Positive
Some serve as his tour guides, though theres evidently some risk in a black woman showing a white man around the hood.
  Negative
With one small exception, its never mentioned whether he paid for such help.
  Negative
He meets one woman who is supposedly the only person to have survived one of Franklins attacks, and she calmly tells him how Lonnie shot her after sex.
  Negative
But then it emerges that there were other survivors of his garage death-chamber not one but several.
  Negative
Broomfield talks to them all.
  Neutral
The picture that emerges from these conversations is one of a social arena where poor women are simply disposable.
  Negative
The men in the community dont care about them, most other women dont care, and the police in general none of whom submit to the interviews that Broomfield requests dont care and dont engage, in part because theyre feared and mistrusted.
  Negative
One black woman tells how she instructs her son: if theres ever any trouble, heres a list of friends and relatives to call do not call , because that will bring the police and, with them, more trouble than youve already got.
  Negative
If there are any heroic figures in this sad tale, its the women of Black Coalition Fighting Back Serial Murders, a grassroots activists organization that took notice of the killings back in the s and spent decades trying to bring official and media attention to them.
  Negative
Their efforts certainly made a difference, yet when random DNA computer tests result in Franklins apprehension, the powers-that-be in L.A. including the police chief, mayor and once-and-future governor Jerry Brown hold a self-congratulatory news conference in which they make it seem that the Grim Sleeper case was finally solved as a result of diligent police concern and effort.
  Neutral
All the evidence that Broomfield presents suggests otherwise.
  Neutral
Yet Tales of the Grim Sleeper is less polemical or argumentative than it is descriptive, almost anthropological.
  Negative
Viewers of different political persuasions might well interpret its findings differently.
  Negative
Yet the films gradual, observant accumulation of details has a singular and lasting power: you wont forget the troubled, troubling world that Broomfield shows you.
  Positive
