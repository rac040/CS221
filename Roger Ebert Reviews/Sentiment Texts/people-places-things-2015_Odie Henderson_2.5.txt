People Places Things treats its characters a lot messier than most romantic comedies, which makes it delightful at times.
  Positive
It also makes it disappointing when the film falls into the same traps that plague romantic comedies.
  Negative
Its rambling nature hints this will be a leisurely stroll through the life of sad-sack cartoonist dad Will Henry "Flight of the Conchords" Jermaine Clement, but at some point leisurely becomes lazy.
  Negative
Writer-director  James C. Strouse builds a lot up a lot of goodwill, even when his characters are intolerable, because he stays rooted in a recognizable, relatable reality.
  Positive
All that goodwill gets squandered with one of the limpest climaxes and endings Ive seen in years.
  Positive
Will Henry teaches a graphic novel class at the local university.
  Positive
During a birthday party for his -year-old twin girls, Will walks in on his wife cheating on him.
  Positive
This scene, which opens the film, is impressive in how it manages to juggle numerous types of humor.
  Very positive
Theres the awkward embarrassment comedy between Will and his wifes kept man, Gary Michael Chemus' whose lack of shirt on his heavy-set frame seems to bother Will more than the affair.
  Negative
Theres the slapstick of the ensuing wrestling match between the two men, both of whom are too polite to put much effort into it.
  Neutral
And theres the broad comedy of the kids walking in on this scene which, if you recall, is unfolding in a house full of -year-olds.
  Positive
Fast-forward a year, and Wills ex-wife Charlie  Stephanie Allynne is living with Gary and sharing custody of the twins Clio and Collete Aundrea and Gia Gadsby, respectively.
  Negative
Her relationship with Will is friendly, though his sarcastic comments about many of the things she says and does hint that his issues with her are unresolved.
  Positive
After one of his classes, Will gets the chance to be dragged back into the dating world when his student Kat  Jessica Williams invites him to dinner.
  Negative
Citing the age difference, Will respectfully declines, a response made even more awkward when he discovers Kat is trying to hook Will up with her mother.
  Negative
Eww, says Kat at the thought of dating her teacher.
  Negative
Thats disgusting!
  Negative
Will alternates between agreeing with her and meekly admitting hes not that bad looking.
  Negative
Kats Mom, Diane  Regina Hall is also a teacher, though her subject is literature and her placeof employment is the prestigious Columbia University.
  Negative
Will writes graphic novels and teaches at School of the Visual Arts, both of which draw Dianes snooty scorn at her dinner table.
  Negative
After the totally botched date, Diane buys a few books from Wills discipline and discovers their literary qualities.
  Negative
Of course, this leads to a tentative romance between the two.
  Positive
One would expect People Places Things to devote more time to this romance than it does.
  Negative
In addition to this, we must contend with Wills relationship with his daughters an admittedly good plotline, with the charming girls stealing every scene from their goofy dad and dealing his ex-wifes flighty personality which gets real annoying, real fast.
  Positive
I understood what the film tries to do with Charlie, but at times she seems more a script convenience than a full-blooded character unsure about her future.
  Negative
Everyscene between her and Will is antagonistic or detrimental to Will in some fashion.
  Negative
The film too often seems to takes his side rather than delve deeper into Charlies indignation about how she gave up her career for his author dreams.
  Negative
This makes the big climactic chat between them seem forced rather than liberating.
  Negative
While Gary is only hauled out for comic fisticuffs with Will, the extraneousness of his character doesnt hurt People Places Things.
  Negative
It actually strengthens the comic tension.
  Positive
Dianes lack of screen time is far more problematic.
  Negative
We like her, and Hall gives her underwritten role some beautifully tragicomic shadings her performance will surprise anyone who only knows her from  Scary Movie.
  Positive
She and Clement complement each other and their scenes really work.
  Positive
But People Places Things is far more preoccupied with the least interesting romantic relationship in the movie, which may actually be the point.
  Negative
The audience sees just how unworkable Will and Charlie are, yet the movie keeps throwing them together in an attempt to jar Will into letting go of his ex.
  Negative
For most of its -minute runtime, I liked enough elements of People Places Things to stay close to a positive review.
  Positive
Clements classroom scenes are quite entertaining, and his performance is a nice piece of understated comedy sprinkled with the sad cluelessness one has when a major relationship falls apart.
  Positive
His final scene with Kat, who looks up to him as a mentor, is very well done.
  Very positive
And you can really feel his love for his girls, so you root for him to start again.
  Positive
The movie was working on me despite my protests.
  Negative
But then I got to that ending, or what passes for one.
  Negative
Its so limp and wimpy that I expected another scene to follow it.
  Negative
Strouse was apparently going for ambiguity, but this is a movie that deserves a far stronger, more definitive fade out.
  Very negative
But then again, perhaps the wimpy ending is exactly what wishy-washy Will Henry deserved.
  Negative
I, on the other hand, deserved better.
  Positive
