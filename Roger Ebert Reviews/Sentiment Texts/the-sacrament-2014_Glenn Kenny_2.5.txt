Low-budget horror tyro  Ti West evokes Jonestown for a generation of viewers too young to remember the place, or the horrific event named for it, in "The Sacrament."
  Negative
West is such a technically accomplished filmmaker, and his cast of semi-regulars so committed to the narrative, that the resultant movie gives enough unsettling atmosphere and upsetting gut-level shock that this viewer didnt mind too much all the stuff he wasnt getting, such as intellectual coherence, not to mention any kind of profound insight into the cult hive mind.
  Positive
West sets his story in the present day.
  Neutral
The movies weakest sequence is its opening, done in faux-televised video style with static-punctuated jump cuts, showing a meeting at the offices of edgy media entity Vice a written prologue explaining to the audience what Vice is ought to win a prize for Lamest Prose To Appear In A Motion Picture Nearly Ever at which "fashion photographer" Patrick  Kentucker Audley recounts to beardo editor Sam A.J. Bowen that his formerly drugged-out sister has quit the United States to live at some kind of sober commune that sounds kind of like a cult.
  Negative
Sam smells a story, so he, Patrick, and videographer Jake filmmaker  Joe Swanberg set off to "Eden Parish" to check out the scene.
  Negative
There they find Patricks sister Caroline  Amy Seimetz, now bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and clean, but a little freaked out by greeting a shoestring camera crew.
  Negative
Shell have to check with "Father" to see if these documentarians may be permitted to document.
  Negative
Folks of a certain age, or those who know a bit about nasty episodes in U.S. history, will have some idea of where this is going.
  Negative
The expression "drank the Kool Aid," although historically inaccurate, has its roots in the Jonestown affair.
  Negative
Is that a spoiler?
  Neutral
In any event, the intrigue is less in the tale than in the telling.
  Negative
The setup for the film suggests a "Blair Witch" style found-footage picture, but West wisely avoids that route.
  Neutral
Yes, much of what we see is through the perspective of Jake, but as his characters a professional, it makes sense that the resultant digital video imagery straddles the ground between found-footage style rawness and more polished feature documentary style.
  Positive
This allows West the stylistic latitude to be more overtly expressive in his imagery.
  Neutral
And to set up interestingly corresponding visuals against character observations such as "this is nothing at all like the hippie commune we were expecting."
  Negative
Indeed, it is not, and the movie gains much power via the performance of the casts oldest principal player,  Gene Jones as the homey but steely "Father."
  Negative
Jones has a background in voiceover, and his rich, mellifluous Southern tones imbue his character with a coziness that can turn sinister on a dime.
  Positive
In his eagerness to get on with the awfulness, West risks some plausibility complaints.
  Negative
The real Jonestown imploded after a year of investigations into the Guyana commune led by the Reverend Jim Jones who, back in the day, was the subject of several fictionalized accounts, including the memorably titled "Guyana: Cult of the Damned"' in "The Sacrament," theyre mixing up the fruit drink after one night of scrutiny from the Vice crew.
  Negative
I know that people consider male urban hipster journalists pretty irritating, but come on.
  Negative
Once things build to a sickly conclusion, West takes advantage of the momentum to indulge in some pretty crass grindhouse exploitations.
  Negative
For all that, the movie gets its disreputable work done' not only will "The Sacrament" creep you out, itll also make you want to shower.
  Negative
Thats not nothing.
  Negative
