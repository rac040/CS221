  Neutral
It is, and a very sure-footed one, although the style does take some getting used to.
  Positive
Between the meticulously composed framing  sometimes breaking down bodies to their component parts, sometimes privileging the talking head and the clear, deadpan delivery of the dialogue, one might be tempted to say that Green accomplishes the not-as-unlikely-as-it-sounds fusion of Bresson and Kaurismaki.
  Negative
But this would be inaccurate, because Son of Joseph doesnt actually feel like a fusion or pastiche.
  Negative
Green is on to his own thing, and while it takes some getting used to, it ultimately provides big rewards both in entertainment I found it reliably warm and funny and Stuff with a Capital S its adaptation and elaboration of Biblical themes posits some worthwhile moral propositions.

Greens magnificent cast is another big plus.

And  Fabrizio Rongione, the Belgian actor whos a veteran of the work of the Dardenne brothers who co-produced this film and starred in Greens last film,  La Sapienza, is almost as beatific as Regnier in the role of Joseph, the man Vincent chooses to be his new dad.
  Negative
I wont spoil the ending although you can probably guess some of it but its as enigmatic and strangely satisfying as many of this unique film's best scenes.
  Positive
