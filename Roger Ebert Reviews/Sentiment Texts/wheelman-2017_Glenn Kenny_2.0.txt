You cant blame genre directors for trying to mix things up now and then, experiment with a new approach, see where it goes.
  Negative
Unfortunately, for this viewer, the formal constraint foisted upon him by writerdirector  Jeremy Rush in Wheelman went right up his nose and stayed there, resulting in a little less than  minutes of annoyance.
  Very negative
The bare bones of the storyline are familiar.
  Neutral
Frank Grillo plays the title wheelman, a reluctant criminal arent they all working a bank robbery against his better judgment.
  Negative
What can he tell you?
  Neutral
Hes less than a year out of prison, he owes money, and he has a beloved daughter who hes trying to provide for and raise right, and an irritated ex-wife who is ever one court judgment away from getting permanent custody of said daughter.
  Negative
So, of course, the job hes working on is going to go very sour.
  Negative
Not that the wheelman initially makes life easy for himself.
  Neutral
Driving the wet nighttime streets, he looks terribly confident and competent, and when he picks up the two bank robbers, he very aggressively high-hats them, refusing to give them a name and snootily telling them that hes not here for small talk.
  Very negative
No, hes here to be a good dad, as his cell-phone conversations with his rebellious teenage daughter Katie tell us.
  Negative
I dont trust crime movies in which the lead character has some sort of fixation with being Father of the Year, but that turns out to be hardly the biggest problem here.
  Negative
No, the biggest problem is the aforementioned formal constraint that writer-director Rush sets up.
  Neutral
Deriving inspiration I presume from the  Tom-Hardy-starring drama  Locke, this is a getaway car chase movie that aspires to remain entirely within the car.
  Negative
Actually, within two cars, but lets not get ahead of ourselves.
  Negative
After the first snafu, in which Grillos wheelman leaves behind the robbers this may be a silly question but given the fact that this movie is entirely night-set, I had to wonder why the bank they knocked over was open so late, he is obliged to play cat and mouse with a variety of unknown-number phone callers, all of whom are abusive and make terrible demands of him.
  Very negative
They also all sound as if theyve been doing  Goodfellas karaoke.
  Negative
For what seems like hours, these various characters exchange Who are yous, where are yous, wheres my moneys, fk yous, fk you motherfers, and so on.
  Very negative
Mr. Rush doesnt seem to grasp that one reason Locke worked was that even though it stuck with one man in one car talking to a variety of people, those people were articulately voiced.
  Negative
More than that, they were brilliantly acted' one of the characters was played by  Olivia Colman.
  Negative
And the movies writerdirector Edward Knight had crafted a multi-leveled, suspenseful storyline to be talked through.
  Negative
Also, having set up this formal constraint, Rush cant even stick with it.
  Negative
The wheelman has to have a sit down with his initial contractor, a guy named Clay.
  Negative
So, he pulls up to the bar where Clay is at, and the camera sits in the car, waits, and captures the wheelman dragging Clay Garrett Dillahunt into the car, so they can talk.
  Negative
At this point, classic film lovers will know what I mean when I say, Gun Crazy this is not.
  Negative
Your mileage may vary, particularly if youre a fan of lead actor Grillo, whose work in a couple of Marvel pictures has earned him one of those cult followings you could call ancillary, no offense to Mr. Grillo.
  Negative
But whatever Wheelman does, it wont propel him to anything beyond that status.
