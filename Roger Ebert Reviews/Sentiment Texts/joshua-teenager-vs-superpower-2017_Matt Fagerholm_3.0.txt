  Negative
Yet the grip of the Chinese Central Government has been tightening around the region ever since, as evidenced by the pro-Beijing Election Committee that selected CY Leung as the current Chief Executive of Hong Kong.

  Negative
Where are the adults?
  Neutral
Wong screams at a rally, acknowledging the inaction of his elders, many of whom are likely too scared to speak up.
  Negative
Joshua: Teenager vs. Superpower is not a great film on the order of Nanfu Wangs  Hooligan Sparrow or Alison Klaymans  Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry, both essential profiles of muckraking activists whistleblowing against government corruption in China, but it does have an equally great story to tell.
  Positive
It is Piscatellas second film about courageous teens, following s chicagoGirl: The Social Network Takes on a Dictatorship, about a young woman in the Windy City suburbs who utilizes social media to help run the revolution in Syria.
  Negative
The most moving footage in this film surveys the sheer scope of people who turn out in support of Scholarisms demonstrations.
  Positive
A few days prior to the  launching of National Education in Hong Kong, Wong and his fellow student activists began occupying a public square at government headquarters.
  Negative
Aside from a brief encounter in front of news cameras, Leung chose to ignore the students until they were joined by , protestors, thus forcing him to announce that the education plan would not be mandatory in Hong Kong.
  Negative
This astonishing victory proved to be short-lived, as Xi Jinping, President of China and General Secretary of the Communist Party, accelerated the pressure to destabilize Hong Kongs democracy by proposing a reform to its electoral system that would prevent citizens from freely choosing their own leader in this years election.
  Negative
Its no surprise that Beijings favored candidate, Carrie Lam, triumphed in March over her opponent, John Tsang, who was more popular with the public.

  Negative
Whereas Occupy Centrals leader, Benny Tai, peacefully surrendered at the end of the protests, Wong placed himself on a hunger strike until doctors urged him to quit.
  Negative
He is devastated by the failure of the Scholarism movement to accomplish its goal, but the extent to which it raised awareness of the corruption in China should deem their efforts a resounding success.
  Positive
The persistence of this young man is awe-inspiring, yet the biggest shortcoming of the picture is its inability to paint a fully dimensional portrait of its own subject.
  Positive
A longtime member of Wongs group, Agnes Chow, confesses that its difficult to be friends with him because hes so skilled at concealing his emotions.
  Positive
His peers compare him to a robot with an onoff switch, and as soon as that switch is flipped on, Wong is unstoppable until he finds himself under arrest.
  Negative
There are times he seems almost superhuman, and aside from a fleeting interview with his mother who is seated next to her silent husband, we get no sense of Wongs home life, nor what drove him to set aside his GPA in order to save his country.
  Negative
Though it falls short on a personal level, the film succeeds as a profile of the student movement itself, which has continued after the dissolution of Scholarism with the founding of a pro-democracy political party, Demosist.

Distributed as a Netflix Original Movie, Joshua: Teenager vs. Superpoweris a worthy addition to the streaming platforms roster of documentaries about inspirational young people including my favorite film from last year, Rokhsareh Ghaem Maghamis Sonita", and a stirring ode to the power of the individual in a society that values conformity over individuality.
  Positive
When Wong was invited to speak at an event in Thailand late last year, the Chinese government ordered for him to be detained and deported promptly upon arrival.

If China continues to censor the voices of activists like Joshua Wong, Ye Haiyan and Ai Weiwei, they shouldnt expect America to play ball that is, if America is still indeed a democracy.
