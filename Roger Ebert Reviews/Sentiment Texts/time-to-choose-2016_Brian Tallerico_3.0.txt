Charles Fergusons Time to Choose has a very direct mission statement.
  Negative
Theres no time for alternate viewpoints when youre going to include lines like We dont want to fail humanity in the opening scenes.
  Negative
For Ferguson and co-writereditor  Chad Beck, the subject matter of Time to Choose is nothing less than the fate of our children.
  Negative
Its tempting to ask yourself what has really changed since  An Inconvenient Truth opened eyes around the world, and countless other climate change docs followed in its Oscar-winning wake, but the main reason that Time to Choose feels different and has value is that it actually offer solutions and hope.
  Positive
Most of these The End is Coming films spew facts about Greenlands ice sheet and the vanishing coral reef almost like horror films, leaving viewers wondering what the heck theyre supposed to do about it, especially if theyre not inclined to visit the website thrown up in the end credits of the cautionary doc they just watched.
  Negative
What elevates Time to Choose, other than its very strong editing by Beck, is the sense that not only are people doing something to change the trajectory of our planets depleted resources but that you can make a difference too.
  Negative
Of course, the first act of any of these films is terrifying, and Ferguson wastes no time.
  Negative
Water supplies are diminishing' natural disasters are increasing' wild fires are more prevalent' global sea levels have risen by eight inches in record time, leading to Many of our major cities will be submerged.
  Negative
And this all happens before the five-minute mark.
  Negative
Theres an impressive shock and awe strategy to the opening of Time to Choose that almost demands you pay attention.
  Positive
And narrator  Oscar Isaacs soothing yet confident voice helps in that regard as well.
  Positive
The film is divided into three chapters.
  Negative
In the first, Coal and Electricity, Ferguson and Beck start in West Virginia, a part of the country defined by the coal industry.
  Negative
Immediately, they go from the macro approach of the impact of their subject on the world and future generations to how depleting the Earths resources is changing lives today.
  Neutral
We meet a woman with four children who all have asthma because of mountaintop coal removal.
  Negative
Millions of acres of mountains in the Appalachians have been blown up, sending elements like arsenic into valleys that are the source of water for everyone around them.
  Negative
Coal sludge is killing people, and creating a captive labor force in that theres no other work and no one will buy the houses in this area.
  Negative
And its MUCH worse in China, where safety is an afterthought.
  Negative
Black lung is killing thousands' coal mines are collapsing'  million people currently suffer from black lung' the average underground coal miner in China has a life expectancy of .
  Negative
Right around the point youll want to switch over to clips of puppies and cartoons to stop from crying, the heartwarming classical music kicks in piano amp' strings, and Ferguson amp' Beck very deftly switch to the solution: Wind and solar power, which has killed no one.
  Negative
Renewable energy, which has become competitive with fossil fuels during the production of the film, is now a reality.
  Positive
Ferguson interviews representatives from companies like Solarcity and Sungevity, people ready to replace the electricity sector with a better machine.
  Negative
And, as the film notes, viable solar power has the capability to help end poverty.
  Negative
It would forever change parts of the world that dont have access to the electricity infrastructure.
  Negative
And while companies like Exxon and Chevron will do a lot to fight it, change is already happening at companies like Google and Ikea, who rely a lot on solar power.
  Negative
Part two moves to Oil and Cars, and one realizes at this point that any of these sections have enough material to fill their own films.
  Positive
Ferguson has a remarkable ability to distill subjects in ways that dont diminish their complexity, which he did to incredible effect in the stunning No End in Sight, still the best doc on the Iraq War in my opinion.
  Positive
In part two and part three Land and Food, Ferguson and Beck follow the same structure presenting disturbing facts like how oil has taken over the Niger Delta or how  of the Earths land is now being used for its livestock, and then showing people willing to make changes and how you can do so as well.
  Negative
So many Doom and Gloom Docs artistically present the problems without the solutions.
  Negative
Time to Choose isnt so much an advocacy documentary as it is an activism one, encouraging you to do something about the problem.
  Negative
The title is a bit misleading.
  Negative
Its hard to watch the film and think theres any other choice.
  Neutral
