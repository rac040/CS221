Realive is a special kind of botched sci-fi film experiment it wants tobe revelatory with the topic oflife and death, and attempts to do so byessentially creating a biopic about the first man to be resurrected.
  Negative
Writerdirector  Mateo Gil co-writer of  The Sea Inside shows us about as complete an image of a fictional characters life as can be, from them being pulled out of the womb to their initial death and then, with the help of cryogenics, theirresurrection.
  Negative
And yet the movie is inescapablylifelessness, unintentionally dumbing itself down while desperately hoping to be profound.
  Negative
The life in question is that of Marc Jarvis  Tom Hughes, a handsome artist who finds success and beautyin his sunny days, and then faces mortifying news: he has a cancerous brain tumor.
  Positive
Not wanting to die from the tumor, he decides to invest his body in cryogenics, hoping that he will be restored at some point later in time.
  Negative
In particular, this mortifies his close friend Naomi  Oona Chaplin, injecting some passion into this story, who, as we learn through an extended chapter this script loves its chapters, has always been his lover but with the wrong timing.
  Negative
This storyline is intercut with that of Marc decades later, resurrected.
  Negative
He wakes up with the help of scientists who have finally succeeded at bringing a human being back to life, and is appropriately nicknamed Lazarus this film even uses footage of the Biblical character from  The Last Temptation of Christ, for good measure.
  Positive
In this section of the film, Marc experiences a slow process of physical and mental recovery, leading him to contemplate his past and the purpose of life, death, Naomiand every other memorybetween.
  Negative
He receives attention from a kind worker named Elizabeth  Charlotte Le Bon, who acclimates him to different ways of life, including the lighter societal rules on sex.
  Positive
The connective tissue for these various timelines of Marcs life is his whimsical narration, which is essentially Gil proving Robert McKee right that screenwriting can do better than relying on voiceover.
  Positive
Realive is absolutely soaked in Marcs voice, his platitudes creating intellectual mush, with an exception for the ones that seem so ready for a gothHomeGoods sales rackyou have to write them down: Life is whats scary, not death.
  Negative
But its always on the verge of extinction.
  Neutral
I dont criticize Gil for his philosophical ambition with this story, but there is a vital sense of editing that could help its main ideas resonate, especially as the narrative struggles to get energy from flashbacks and meditation.
  Negative
As it covers different parts of Marcs life, unique flashing visuals a chicken with its head cut-off, a close-up of his dying father in an oxygen mask provide a resonating sense of who he is.
  Negative
Theres a striking scene in which Marc, newly resurrected, interacts with a new headset technology of recording memory, allowing sporadic ideas of his life to flickerbefore his eyes.
  Positive
But its the way that Gil packages these small yet significant moments with filmmaking that makes it allgeneric: these images of raw life experience aim to be as pretty as possible, with soaring strings slathering on importance.
  Positive
For a movie that wants to reach audiences with its passion for life, its heavy hands barely welcome a viewers organic interest of reflecting on the life unfolding on-screen.
  Positive
A key vacuum for this story is that Marc is a boring dude.
  Negative
His experience is, of course, curious, being the first resurrected human being, and all that.
  Positive
And there is a fragment of an interesting performance as Hughes demonstrates the acute physicality of someone who would be brought back to life.But Marc himself isnot very charming although his aside to his past friends that hell f k their grandchildren is...amusing and his designation as a successful artist does not make his life seem any more important.
  Positive
As Hughes portrays him with utter whimsy, Marc does not garner the intrigue that makes us want to learn more about his life, to watch him get used to his resurrection, or for Gods sake, listen to him talk through an entiremovie.
  Positive
