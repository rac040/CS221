Blue Jay is a gentle, genuine trip down memory lane that features one of our best actresses in the kind of role she doesnt get to play that often, and another great turn in the arc of an independent film icon.
  Very positive
Its a two-hander through and through theres only one other speaking role at all and its minor and the two leads are more than up to the challenge, giving so much to one another that we fill in the history of their relationship and the years theyve spent apart.
  Negative
The final act has a twist that doesnt particularly work for me mostly in that I wish there was no revelation in that moment at all but the performances are so truthful that it doesnt really matter.
  Positive
Jim  Mark Duplass has come home to take care of his mothers house after her passing.
  Positive
Hes also clearly got some other issues going on, and Duplass is excellent at subtly capturing a man who often appears on the verge of tears.
  Positive
When his high school sweetheart Amanda  Sarah Paulson, home because her sister is about to have a baby, runs into Jim at the grocery store, she too senses an undercurrent of sadness.
  Negative
Perhaps thats why she agrees to get some coffee with him and then go back to his house to drink, play, laugh and talk about their lives.
  Negative
He needs a friend, and they used to be much more than friends.
  Positive
In his childhood home, they find old love letters and tapes they made together.
  Negative
In one recording, they play-act their  th  wedding anniversary.
  Positive
Being able to listen to a teenage version of yourself pretending to be the age you are now sounds absolutely terrifying to me.
  Positive
After listening to that tape, the somewhat-tense dynamic between Jim and Amanda softens.
  Negative
They decide to play-act again, pretending to be a married couple celebrating over dinner.
  Negative
They dance to Annie Lennox.
  Neutral
They talk about their lives and their issues.
  Neutral
In a sense, they are still those sweetly romantic kids, but jobs and families and other trappings of adulthood just got in the way.
  Positive
They act goofy, almost too much so, but the actors make it feel believable that theyre really acting like teenagers again.
  Positive
Theres so much fine detail in the acting work, especially by Paulson, who was so drastically different in her Emmy-winning role on The People v. OJ Simpson that everyone who saw that should watch this just to see her remarkable range.
  Positive
Her take on Amanda contains so many subtle layers.
  Positive
Theres a scene early in their time at Jims home in which she just laughs and moves her body ever so slightly into his, conveying a comfort through body language, an underutilized tool of the modern actor.
  Negative
Blue Jay is a dialogue-driven piece, of course, but it works because of whats unsaid verbally and what we get from a look by Duplass or a laugh from Paulson.
  Neutral
They are both fantastic here, especially her.
  Positive
Its one of my favorite actress performances of the year.
  Very positive
Of course, theres a shadow that hangs over Blue Jay in that the question of why Jim and Amanda broke up in the first place isnt answered until the climax, and that makes it a bit more of a mystery than I would have liked.
  Negative
Im also not sure that, as good as he is the rest of the film, Duplass quite nails the big reveal, although Paulson makes up for it.
  Positive
More than judging it individually, I just wish that movies like this would either reveal the break-up cause early or not at all, making it more about where they are now than the mystery of how they got there.
  Very negative
Having said that, Im a sucker for two-handers with performances this good.
  Negative
I always have been and I always will be.
  Positive
Its probably my theatre background, or simply my adoration for  Richard Linklaters Before trilogy.
  Negative
It could also easily be because of how saturated we are with CGI blockbusters lately, and how much I appreciate it when a film goes back to character and gives us people who feel like we could know them.
  Negative
Or, at their best, like we could be them.
  Neutral
