If there were still such a thing as the friendly neighborhood video store which in most places, there isn't anymore you could stock an entire section with Ali documentaries "Facing Ali," " The Trials of Muhammad Ali," "Muhammad Ali: Through the Eyes of the World," " When We Were Kings" and features that use Ali as a character the best are Michael Mann's under-appreciated " Ali" ' the worst is probably the  curiosity " The Greatest," which Ali played himself.

Clare Lewins' new documentary"I Am Ali" is a great introduction to the boxer, activist and super-celebrity if you don't know much about him.
  Positive
It doesn't break any new ground, not does it claim to, but it's likable and reasonably thorough It his all of the expected historical markers, including his conversion to Islam and his decision to change his name, his major defeats and victories in the ring, his decision to resist induction during Vietnam and the subsequent loss of his title, his return to the ring, and his diagnosis with Parkinson's disease, which his own doctors said was worsened by head injuries he suffered while doing the thing he was put on earth to do.

  Negative
Much of the film is built snippets from  hours' worth of audio tapes gifted from Ali to his daughterHana, the seventh of his nine kids.

This was a fateful one he performed poorly, for the most part, and suffered a lot of damage and to be able to hear him discussing it on the phone with one of his daughters is at once elating and unnerving.
  Negative
Rather than cut to news footage or still photos, Lewins shows a sound meter, the levels flatlining and then jumping to life.
