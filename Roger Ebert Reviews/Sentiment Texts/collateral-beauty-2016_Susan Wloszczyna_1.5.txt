Grief is a prevalent theme at the movies right now.
  Positive
Such diverse titles as  Manchester by the Sea,  Jackie and  Arrival come at the difficult topic from wildly different angles personal, political and otherworldly.
  Negative
But they all manage to justify their use of dead loved ones as a generator of not just emotion, but of understanding about what happens in the aftermath of such great loss.
  Negative
Now along comes  CollateralBeauty to spoil it all by milking bereavement for shoddy bromides and cheap tears.
  Neutral
Not that this knockoff Hallmark special doesnt go out of its way to camouflage its ill-conceived intentions as well as the considerable debt it owes to such seasonal chestnuts as A Christmas Carol and Its a Wonderful Life.
  Negative
Director  David Frankel canine cry-a-thon Marley amp' Me and writer  Allan Loeb the scribe behind such DVD bargain-bin dwellers as  Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, The Dilemma and  Rock of Ages provide plenty of fancy window dressing, including a stellar cast and a fantasy Manhattan festooned with twinkly Christmas lights, pine limbs and dirt-free curbside snow.
  Negative
Call me cynical but I always get suspicious when an acting ensemble feels incredibly star-stacked.
  Negative
Its a sure sign of over-compensation.
  Positive
Consider that  CollateralBeauty features two Oscar winners  Kate Winslet and  Helen Mirren, three Oscar nominees  Will Smith,  Keira Knightley and  Edward Norton and a current Golden Globe nominee, as well as a likely future Oscar contender  Naomie Harris of  Moonlight in a pear tree.
  Positive
Even such second-tier players as  Michael Pea and  Ann Dowd carry some considerable cachet.
  Positive
Sometimes, I just hate it when I am right.
  Negative
Lets start at the beginning.
  Neutral
There is the Will Smith that we know and love, with that dazzling smile and oodles of manly self-confidence.
  Positive
He is rallying the troops at his successful ad agency by asking the pseudo-profound question, What is your why?
  Negative
I would respond, What is the what?
  Neutral
But his character Howard, instead, says, Time, love and death.
  Negative
These three things connect every single human being on Earth.
  Neutral
We long for love.
  Neutral
We wish we had more time.
  Negative
And we fear death.
  Neutral
Deep, right?
  Positive
Wrong.
  Neutral
OK, then.
  Neutral
It is three years later , and Howard is a shell of a man, alone, silent and empty after the death of his six-year-old daughter from a rare disease.
  Negative
He spends his days in his office constructing elaborate mazes using a platoon of domino tiles, only to knock them all down in one fell swoop and start over at this point, Warning: Metaphor Ahead should flash onscreen.
  Very negative
At night, in his monk-like apartment, he writes bitter diatribes railing at Time, Love and Death, and then actually mails these notes to their subjects, complete with stamps but no address.
  Negative
His business partners, played by Winslet, Norton and Pea, are understandably nervous because Howard was the charismatic force driving the agency and is the majority shareholder.
  Negative
With sliding profits, they want to buy him out, but he refuses to discuss such details in his withdrawn state.
  Negative
Norton is so concerned that he hires a private investigator Dowd to spy on Howard, and she manages to retrieve his three notes from a mailbox, illegalities be damned.
  Negative
Then, magically, Norton stumbles upon a solution when he is taken with an attractive young woman auditioning for an ad Knightley and decides to follow her across the street to a theater.
  Neutral
There, he finds her rehearsing a play with a young man  Jacob Latimore and an older white-haired lady Mirren and decides, hey, let me hire you three to act as the human incarnations of Time, Love and Death, and make Howard completely nuts so we can prove he is unstable and save our company.
  Negative
Mirren, who remains relatively unscathed despite being forced into sassy senior mode, has second thoughts.
  Negative
In one of the more timely asides in the script, she asks if Nortons character wants the trio to gaslight Howard.
  Negative
But as desperate thespians are wont to do, they all agree so they can fund their play.
  Negative
Of course, it isnt as simple as that, considering how much attention is paid to the personal travails facing divorced dad Norton, childless workaholic Winslet and a cough-riddled Pea as well.
  Negative
By the time Howard starts opening up to a grief counselor Harris, who also lost a daughter to disease, there is a growing sense that funny business is afoot and not in a good way.
  Positive
Sure, there are up-to-date references to hard-to-get Hamilton tickets and Norton jokingly observes, Now they have CSI: Cleveland?
  Negative
to his dementia-suffering mother while watching TV.
  Neutral
But these asides are simply distractions from what appalling twists lie in wait.
  Negative
I dont think I've witnessed a film this year that managed to so completely and utterly collapse into crass garbage in its last few minutes while abusing what little goodwill it has.
  Negative
Sort of the way a shaky line of dominoes can tumble down in a flash.
  Negative
Forget  CollateralBeauty, whatever that means.
  Neutral
This is CollateralSchmaltz, the kind that has the power to close rather than open your heart as you rush out of the theater while the terribly named OneRepublic ballad, Lets Hurt Tonight, provides exit music.
  Negative
