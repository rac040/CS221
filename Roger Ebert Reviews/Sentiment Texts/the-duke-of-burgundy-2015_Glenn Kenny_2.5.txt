In theory, a person like myself ought to be all about The Duke of Burgundy, the odd new film directed by  Peter Strickland.
  Neutral
Now thats not to say that the theory would be my own, but lets just say Id have to concur with it.
  Neutral
Burgundy, which is British director Stricklands third feature-length film, is, like Stricklands prior, Berberian Sound Studio, a bit of a journey into the past, and a very particular past.
  Very positive
Where Berberian situated itself in the world of s Italian horror filmmaking, the better to pay effective homage to it while also crafting an evocative psychological thriller, Burgundy harks back to the heyday, such as it was, of cheap European sexploitation cinema.
  Negative
Cinema that tarted itself up with fake-erudite allusions to Sade andor Sacher-Masoch, cinema that offered cheap thrills on cheaper film stock but often flirted or in some case consummated an actual relationship with the genuinely surreal andor sadistic.
  Negative
So, the reason that Id be likely to be all about Duke is because Im a known admirer of a lot of such work the films of disreputable-to-the-respectable-cinephile directors such as Jess Franco, Jean Rollin, all those guys.
  Negative
I've been examining their stuff since back when the only way you could get it in the U.S. was on dubious VHS transfers from merchants with names like Video Search Of Miami and so on.
  Negative
Ive been a subscriber to Video Watchdog since it launched.
  Neutral
I introduced Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film author Michael Weldon to current New York film critic David Edelstein something like thirty years ago.
  Negative
And so on.
  Neutral
Stricklands film is a daring, atmosphere-soaked piece of kink hypnotherapy that pays explicit homage to the films of Franco, down to the casting of former Franco regular, formidable femme  Monica Swinn, in a sinister role.
  Very positive
Its not a horror film per se, and is in fact a little comedic in its overt content.
  Negative
The two main characters, Cynthia Sidse Babbett Knudsen, looking rather more severe here than she did in  Mifune, the  Dogme film for which shes best known in the States and the younger Evelyn Chiara DAnna, whos perhaps her protg, are both engaged in heavy entomological studies and are also lovers.
  Negative
In their capacity in the latter department, they are seriously role-playing lovers, with Evelyn in the sub role and Cynthia doing the domming.
  Positive
Theres all manner of restraint, strictness, and general severity in their scenarios, but it becomes pretty clear right off the bat that their roles as lovers are not analogous to their roles in the relationship outside the role playing.
  Negative
That is, Evelyn has very specific demands as to how she needs to be dominated, while Cynthia is insecure and in need of direction and always scared shell botch thingsand you also get a sense that deep down inside, shed be much happier with just a regular lesbian relationship.
  Negative
This is where the comedic aspect of the whole thing comes in.
  Neutral
For a lot of us who have little or no experience with the rituals or sadomasochism or any of that other kind of stuff, one question that occurs is how do people who ARE into that sort of thing manage to keep a straight face while saying Yes, Mistress, or whatever.
  Negative
The problem for Evelyn and Cynthia isnt so much the straight face but the level of commitment, and it cuts both ways.
  Negative
One of Evelyns favored scenarios entails her being bound and spending the night in a sealed chest.
  Positive
Invariably when the lovers try this out, it isnt long before Evelyn starts peeping out the couples safe word, Pinastri, which, you know, in this case means let me out!
  Negative
Theres something droll about all these doings, which alternate between bizarre scenes of insect knowledge delivered in a lecture hall and long-shot glimpses of a leering nosy neighbor Swinn in the adjoining yard to the couples ornate residence.
  Negative
And thats pretty much the whole of the movie: there is very little of what youd call a plot, which is also true of the movies Burgundy pays homage to' they often took an elliptical approach to story either by perverse design or micro-budget-triggered sloth or some combo thereof.
  Negative
Here its all very deliberate, and in keeping with the movies lush aural and visual surfaces' while soft focus and zooms are in no short supply here, the execution is a lot creamier, and more polished, than what the impoverished auteurs of the old days could muster.
  Positive
Why am I not crazier about the film?
  Negative
It certainly is, at least, a mildly seductive exercise in sound and vision' but while the visuals are always arresting, they are rarely entirely compelling.
  Positive
As much admiration as I had for Stricklands vision ably captured by cinematographer Nicholas D. Knowland, there was also something about it that struck me as rather fussy.
  Negative
In the Franco and Rollin films that Strickland so clearly admires, there were multiple elements of anarchy andor amateurism that could even accidentally propel the movie into a realm of seemingly genuine danger.
  Negative
This filmmaker has things very well under control to the extent that hes able to stage and shoot more than one ostensibly explicit love scene without revealing any nudity, which I know sounds like Im complaining, but honestly, thats not it and as such the feel of pastiche is kind of inescapable.
  Negative
The thing is, if you recognize the names of the filmmakers Ive alluded to in this review, you identified yourself as its core demo before you go to the end of the first paragraph.
  Negative
You will see the movie whether I give it a thumbs-up or not!
  Neutral
As for everybody else?
  Neutral
What can I say?
  Neutral
Proceed with care.
  Positive
If youre in the mood for something differentsomething possibly completely differentthis will fill the bill.
