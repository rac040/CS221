At some point in between the gun-glorifying shootouts and the ridiculous vehicular chases that end in an explosive inferno that would scare even Dante, Ride Along  pulls over now and then to engage in comical repartee.
  Negative
Such as when the sequel pauses to allow its motor-mouthed star  Kevin Hart to engage in a debate over which chapter from the original  Star Wars trilogy is the best.
  Positive
Hart goes with  Return of the Jedi while cast newcomer  Ken Jeong, whose on-the-run computer hacker AJ is virulently anti-Ewok, sticks with  The Empire Strikes Back.
  Negative
Yes, this is just one of a multitude of throwaway jokes.
  Negative
But it might also be a throwdown.
  Neutral
This second helping of Harts hyper hijinks as rookie cop Ben, once more paired with  Ice Cubes glowering bulldog presence as rule-flouting veteran James, exists for the same reason that  Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens does: money.
  Negative
The crime capers  predecessor opened to a surprising .
  Positive
million in the dead of January and ended up collecting  million.
  Neutral
Not surprisingly, and just like the seventh Star Wars outing, Ride Along  pretty much employs the same crowd-pleasing blueprint as the initial go-round: Ben and James are at odds.
  Negative
Ben and James must capture a bad guy.
  Neutral
Ben blunders and James fumes.
  Positive
Ben proves to be a law-enforcing savant of sorts.
  Neutral
James commits all manner of civil-liberty infractions with impunity.
  Neutral
And they eventually get their man.
  Neutral
That might be one reason why box-office pundits predict that this rather unremarkable crime-caper follow-up will finally vanquish The Force Awakens, the top domestic grosser of all time, by ending its three-week run at No.
  Negative
.
  Neutral
The plot picks up shortly after the first movie ended, with former Atlanta security guard Ben just a week away from being wed to adoring girlfriend Angela  Tika Sumpter, a sweet actress whose value to the story is sadly reduced to the depth of her cleavage now that brother James has given his blessing.
  Negative
Once again, Harts over-eager, accident-prone apprentice on probation now that he has graduated from police school must prove he is worthy to be a full-fledged officer.
  Negative
After a belabored opening sequence in which height-challenged Ben struggles mightily to exit a bouncy low-rider and eventually causes James partner  Tyrese Gibson of the Fast amp' Furious franchise to be shot, he and James head to a Miami to find AJ, the key to catching a shipping mogul who specializes in all manner of illegal contraband  Benjamin Bratt as a rather lackadaisical villain who could at least have bothered to twirl his goatee.
  Negative
Returning director  Tim Story takes advantage of the switch to a tropical clime by attiring Hart in clownish tourist clothes and jamming crowd scenes with as many busty, booty-shaking bikini babes and shapely model types as he can.
  Negative
Thankfully,  Olivia Munn gets to flex some female muscle as Maya, a Miami homicide detective who is capable of melting Ice Cubes street-hardened heart while joining Ben and James on their mission.
  Negative
But she, too, is upstaged by her chest-hugging apparel, topped off by a dress with a plunging neckline that comes in handy as she uses her wiles to distract Bratt's baddie on the dance floor and if that isnt a tired clich, then I dont know what is while attending a fancy party.
  Negative
How confident are the makers of Ride Along  that they will cash in again?
  Neutral
Consider that the worst slapstick escapade is highlighted in the trailer, as a screechy Hart must pretend to ward off what is likely to be the cheesiest fake giant alligator since, well, s  Alligator.
  Very negative
And just wait for the breathless backyard foot race through Little Havana when Hart and Jeong encounter all manner of predictable obstacles, including the typical mean dog and having to bounce on a trampoline to get over a barrier.
  Very negative
At least it is more exciting than when Hart argues the decorative merits of hydrangeas with  Sherri Shepherd as a tyrannical wedding planner.
  Positive
To be fair, there are at least two standout moments that should be acknowledged.
  Negative
One is Harts clever bit about custom ringtones used to identify cell callers that pays off with a great aural punchline.
  Positive
The other is a rather original twist on the usual high-impact car chase that allows us to see the action in the way that video-game addict Ben does as a real-life version of  Grand Theft Auto.
  Positive
One of the loudest laughs arrives when we get to enjoy a scowling James re-imagined as a game character.
  Positive
Points for greater diversity in the cast as well, but, if there is a second sequel in the offing, please allow the women to be more than the sum of their body parts.
  Negative
Probably a good test of whether you should consider riding along with this low-rent version of Bad Boys meets  Rush Hour is if you are tickled by Ben suggesting that he and James call themselves The Brothers-in-Law.
  Positive
Get it?
  Neutral
They are brothers-in-law and they are "brothers" IN Law.
  Neutral
OK.
  Neutral
You can stop giggling now.
