This Italian documentary is the official submission from that country for the next Academy Awards.
  Positive
The reaction to this from certain Italian fiction filmmakers has been not unlike the consternation certain novelists have expressed about  Bob Dylan being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature.
  Negative
But,  Paolo Sorrentinos soreness notwithstanding, this is a pertinent gesture, one of self-criticism, even.
  Negative
For Fire at Sea, in a sense, chronicles an Italian failure.
  Negative
An Italian failure that is, arguably, shared by the rest of the Western world.
  Negative
Lampedusa is, per Wikipedia, the largest island of the Pelagie Islands in the Mediterranean Sea.
  Negative
Its closeness to Libya makes it a relatively desirable landing point for African and North African refugees fleeing from wars, unrest, and starvation on that continent.
  Negative
Relatively desirable because, as the movie shows in patiently unfolded detail, theres really very little upside to being a refugee.
  Negative
Directed by  Gianfranco Rosi, the movie begins with a text that reels off some numbers: , migrants, , deaths.
  Negative
Such big numbers are hard to see as anything but abstractions.
  Neutral
Rosi then cuts to some beautiful, peaceful imagery.
  Positive
Giant radio antennas revolve in front of a dramatic sky full of grey clouds over an undulating sea.
  Negative
A radio DJ says some calming words.
  Neutral
It doesnt seem like a deadly environment.
  Negative
The movie doesnt use any narration' the opening text is all the hand-holding the viewer gets.
  Negative
Rosi instead homes his camera on narratives pertaining at first to the natives of the island.
  Neutral
A compassionate doctor is seen treating patients who clearly arent locals.
  Positive
He bemoans the indignities they suffer, and their deaths.
  Negative
A young boy, a neighbor of the doctor, makes slingshots using medical rubber bands and takes them to a local field to shoot with his pals.
  Negative
Soon there are shots of choppers and a boat.
  Neutral
The latest batch of migrants is here.
  Neutral
Theyre drenched in diesel, one coastal patrol worker says, examining a few people who have come off a boat.
  Negative
If I flicked a cigarette lighter in here the whole room would go up.
  Negative
The underfed migrants, who mostly look down at their feet as they meet the people into whose hands theyve placed their fates, grow voluble after a while.
  Negative
In a holding cell, one of them speak-sings of his journey here, from Nigeria.
  Negative
We drank our piss to survive, he wails, both proud and miserable.
  Negative
The doctor continues treating these folks, one by one.
  Neutral
The young boy, Samuele, is diagnosed with lazy eye and wanders around with an eyepatch.
  Negative
The sea is always there, ready to deliver new shipments of humanity.
  Positive
Rosis film is thoughtful and well-constructed.
  Very positive
It doesnt strive for the epic feel of Viscontis La terra trema, the  epic about Sicilian fisherman thats been an inescapable influence on Italian film.
  Negative
Its intimacy is a boon.
  Positive
But as laudable as the movie is, it does not quite achieve greatness.
  Negative
Thats the fault of both its indirectness and its obviousness.
  Neutral
The portrayals of life in Lampedusa that dont touch on the migrant crisis have a distance from the subject matter that seems a little besides the point at times.
  Negative
As for obviousness, theres a scene in which Samuele and his friend are in a field using their new slingshots to shoot projectiles at cactus plants.
  Negative
After doing considerable damage to one of the plants, Samuele tries to make up for it by putting a mutilated plant back together using electrical tape.
  Negative
As they used to say in The New Yorker, block that metaphor!
  Positive
The words offered by the physician about how we as humans ought not allow our, if youll pardon the phrase, brothers and sisters to suffer as these migrants do is the pictures ultimate takeaway, and a worthwhile one.
  Positive
While furiously stoked myths of otherness are threatening to suck our civilization down a whirlpool of paranoia, Fire At Sea argues that the only race on this planet is the human one.
  Negative
