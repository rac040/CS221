"I'm inside my head," Murphy  Karl Glusman, a humorless young man in lust, says at one point in "Love," French provocateur Gaspar No's sexually-explicit drama about romance and, well, being inside your head.
  Negative
"Love" unsentimentally depicts Murphy's affair with Electra  Aomi Muyock as a series of flashbacks, showing us all the information we need through the lens of Murphy's present-day emotions.
  Negative
But because No wants viewers to see Murphy's memories as a womb-like retreat, the first thing that impresses viewers about present-day Murphy is his petulance, expressed immediately through Glusman's flat, affect-less voiceover narration voice.
  Negative
Murphy may be concerned with his romantic feelings for Electra, but he's also a brat who blames his wife Omi  Klara Kristin for his loveless marriage.
  Negative
"Love" is accordingly a prickly consideration of a past-tense sexual relationship from the perspective of a present-tense relationship that's well past its expiration date.Think of "Love" as a time travel movie, but about really sad young people you probably wouldn't want to hang out with in real life.
  Negative
In "Love," Murphy essentially relives a past life.
  Neutral
He is not however in control of his emotions, so his memories are fragmented, and out of order.
  Negative
He recalls Electra because her mother calls him, giving him a sentimental oasis to cling to in order to escape his life with Omi.
  Positive
Still, in flashbacks, we see how Murphy's relationship with Omi ironically started because of Electra, and how Electra and Murphy's relationship was always a co-dependent one.
  Positive
He, a film student with posters of "Sal," and "Story of O" hanging ostentatiously on his bedroom wall, jealously obsesses over her.
  Negative
But eventually she, an aspiring painter, reveals that she's just as concerned with being protected.
  Positive
They form an unhealthy relationship that expresses itself through violent outbursts, and copious sex scenes that range from genuinely sexy to mechanically frantic.
  Positive
So while Electra accuses Murphy of being a bright young man who doesn't know what love is, she's just as impulsive.
  Negative
Since No "Enter the Void," " Irreversible" wants to steep viewers in Murphy's confused emotions, the experience of watching "Love" can sometimes be more frustrating than thinking about the meaning of "Love" while you watch the film.
  Negative
In fact, "Love" probably only works if you see it as a paradoxically over-determined work of and about sensuality.
  Positive
No uses -D photography but also never stops reminding viewers that they are outside of the frame, as he directly acknowledges in one scene where an erect penis thrusts directly at the camera before ejaculating CGI semen.
  Negative
You can't watch this movie and ever really forget that you're watching a movie, as is reinforced by the film's elliptically-structured plot, droning soundtrack and periodic mid-scene black-out cuts.
  Negative
That's because Murphy is, like some of No's previous blank slate heroes, a character who remembers himself at his most frustratingly vacant.
  Negative
Murphy thinks he knows it all, but is unfailingly clueless, as we see when he first meets Electra, and blurts out "What's the meaning of life?"
  Negative
and she quickly responds in kind: "Love."
  Negative
No's movie is about characters who want to stay nestled in the past, as is evidenced by his frequent use of reddish-brown camera filters, and symmetrical frames-within-camera-frames compositions.
  Negative
"Love" is about an angry, sulking character who think he wants to make a "sentimental" romance featuring sex, but is ultimately incapable and essentially uninterested of seeing outside of himself.
  Neutral
But what's it like toactuallywatch "Love"?
  Neutral
This is a movie where non-professional actors and unsimulated sex scenes constantly encourage viewers to form a bond of alienation, instead of a bond of sympathy, with Murphy.
  Negative
That may sound pretentious, butNo knows exactly the type of effect he wants to achieve, and he mostly gets it.
  Negative
His biggest gamble is the use of first-time actors to elicit complex emotions.
  Positive
But he builds a complex relationship between Murphy and his viewers throughout the movie, one that speaks louder than the unmoving, shrill line-readings from all three of the film's principle characters.
  Negative
The film's sex scenes are similarly mannered, mournful and distractingly graphic.
  Negative
But they're not just endurance tests, or frustrating slogs either.
  Negative
No wants you to see sex as a cocoon, so he genuinely tries to show you what attracts his youngcharactersto each other.
  Negative
His earnest objectification of actors' bodies is, in that sense, often compelling.
  Positive
We look at bodies in motion, andsee them as body parts first, and then people trying to get lost in each other, to give each other pleasure, and to remain lost in sensations that will always remain mysterious to anyone who isn't experiencing them first-hand.
  Very negative
"Love" may not always be enjoyable, but it leaves an abiding mark.
  Positive
