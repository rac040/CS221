Jarius McLearys The Work has all the superficial trappings of a bland feel-good documentary thats riddled with good intentions but fails to involve, formally or otherwise.
  Negative
A film about prison rehabilitation and the power of group therapy, The Work could easily have rested on the laurels of its admirable subject matter and preached instead of observed, constantly spoke instead of listened.
  Negative
By the -minute mark, however, it immediately becomes clear that McLeary and his co-director  Gethin Aldous have no interest in infantilizing their audience.
  Negative
They are there simply to bear witness to hardened men, inside and outside of prison, breaking down the walls inside themselves.
  Neutral
McLeary and Aldous only request is for its audience to follow them down that emotional chasm.
  Negative
In Folsom State Prison, convicts meet weekly for intensive group therapy.
  Negative
Twice a year, they invite members of the public to join them for a four-day session.
  Negative
McLeary follows three citizens Charles, a bartender and father of three' Chris, a twenty-something museum associate' and Brian, a teachers assistant during their session as they share in and experience catharsis simply by agreeing to participate in such a vulnerable activity.
  Negative
All of them start from a hesitant, yet eager place, and all eventually expel some pain, even if it has to be dragged out of them by the inmates, who are still fighting their own demons.
  Negative
The dramatic arcs of the subjects should be obvious to anyone who has even witnessed therapy from afar, but because McLeary never contrives any specific moment for the men to reach their own affecting emotional climaxes, they retain the ability to surprise and unsettle.
  Negative
In fact, the films first major sequence doesnt involve any of the civilians, but rather Kiki, a man who has served  years for a murderrobbery conviction and doesnt have the tools to properly mourn for the loss of his sister.
  Negative
McLeary fixes the camera on Kiki as a group leader pushes him to feel his sadness, marinating in the lengthy period when he tries to avoid the sorrow.
  Negative
Kiki eventually collapses in violent sobs, ejecting his hurt like a virus.
  Negative
In The Work, McLeary doesnt dabble in portraiture.
  Negative
He concisely communicates the pertinent truth about his subjects so they fill in three dimensions, but no more than that.
  Negative
Instead, he captures the singular moment of expulsion, when the floodgates open and theres no hiding from the release.
  Neutral
The Work operates on one tonal frequency by design' McLeary quickly goes up to  and never dials down.
  Negative
By returning to the same emotional well again and again, the film risks the possibility of hitting diminishing returns, especially because many of McLearys subjects share similar trauma.
  Negative
Indeed, the backstretch succumbs to some monotony.
  Negative
Yet, the honesty on display turns a potential bug into a feature.
  Positive
McLeary appropriately doesnt get in the way of his subjects or the setting.
  Negative
He captures his group members in close-up and allows their stories to resonate on their own.
  Positive
But his lack of explicit formal maneuvering doesnt indicate an unsteady hand.
  Negative
He and his editor  Amy Foote construct a series of moments that dont add up to a neat narrative, yet suggest an open-ended journey, which is its own accomplishment.
  Positive
The aesthetic highlight of The Work involves microphones: As a group leader embraces an inmate, begging him not to give up on his life, he muffles both their mics, rendering their cries and words largely unintelligible.
  Negative
We watch this private, intimate moment for roughly a minute before the leader unclasps and the sound clarifies.
  Positive
It engenders the feeling of finding the first bit of light after climbing through a dark tunnel.
  Neutral
The Work never openly articulates any critique of masculinity, mostly because McLearys footage renders it unnecessary.
  Negative
By simply watching the participants talk about their feelings, sometimes in the vaguest of terms, McLeary illustrates how men build strong faades to conceal their pain from others and themselves.
  Positive
The films most powerful sequence involves Brian, who enters Folsom with a condescending edge.
  Positive
McLeary portrays him as a cocky professional who uses intellect and vocabulary as a weapon, someone who clearly treats others poorly likely without realizing it.
  Negative
His prisoner guides have him pegged right away' they know hes a ticking time bomb thats ready to explode, and they openly comment on how they see themselves in him.
  Negative
Sure enough, after a day and a half of judgment and false superiority towards his group members, he breaks, and the results are fairly shattering.
  Negative
The Work asserts that the collapse of emotional barriers feels like an exorcism, and that lifes true labor involves facing and contending with the blues inside us all.
  Negative
Prison blues doesnt only belong to actual prisoners.
