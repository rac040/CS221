For as many valid and well-reasoned arguments exist about how nostalgia is a spiritually and culturally ossifying force, human beings and the culture industry that pursues them cant seem to help the practice.
  Negative
Of all the bands that emerged during the U.K.s punk rock years, The Clash was perhaps the most explicitly anti-nostalgia' the entire point of the songs was a here-and-now anger.
  Negative
This extended from the no-Elvis-no-Beatles-no-Stones new rule of its single  to the  simulated emergency broadcast of This Is Radio Clash.
  Negative
By pointing this out I dont mean to suggest that The Clashs music has no validity when heard in .
  Negative
But it signifies very differently.
  Positive
In any event, the particularity of what the band did in the late s makes the nostalgic spectacle of London Town kind of curious.
  Positive
The movie, directed by  Derrick Borte from a script by  Matt Brown adapting a prior project written by  Sonya Gildea and  Kirsten Sheridan, and no, these kinds of pass-the-conceptual-football writing credits never really bode well, do they gets the music pretty well, even as it fudges some release dates.
  Very negative
But the movies impersonal, conventional telling of a reasonably standard male coming-of-age story almost tends to make the punk milieu it depicts beside the point.
  Negative
As the movie opens, Shay  Daniel Huttlestone, a fellow in his early teens who wears flared pants that are at least four years behind the times even by  standards, feels oppressed in his just-outside-of-London home, living with single dad Nick  Dougray Scott and a little sister.
  Negative
He gets a letter and a cassette tape from his mum, whos apparently swinging in London, punk style.
  Negative
A few tentative forays to the big city find Shay romancing a sassy punkette named Vivian Nell Williams, finding that his mums communal lifestyle is somewhat more rough and ready than is appropriate for a -year-old, and being counseled by  Joe Strummer himself, a fellow who seems to turn up in the most unlikely places.
  Negative
For instance, as a fare in Shays fathers cab, which Shay is driving, in drag.
  Negative
Its a long story, tied up with his dads hospitalization after an accident and the subsequent economic doom it portends.
  Negative
While trying to stave off disaster, Shay also experiences the exhilaration of being young and idealistic and in love and actually attending Clash rehearsals.
  Negative
In the hands of more distinctive filmmakers this might come off, but the approach here is indie-slick and impersonal.
  Negative
Which, among other things, underscores just what a boring readymade character young Shay is.
  Negative
When he discovers that Vivians home environment is quite a bit posher than shes let on, he responds with a hissy fit of ugly sexism that you just know is going to be forgiven by both Vivian and the film before the final credits.
  Negative
This might be realistic, but its also boring and stale.
  Negative
The portrayal of Strummer by  Jonathan Rhys-Meyers who has a history of portraying rockers simultaneously iconic and iconoclastic' see  Velvet Goldmine is, I suppose, an interesting rethink of Strummers micromanaged guttersnipe charisma.
  Negative
But its one that would have been more interesting in a better film.
  Negative
As it happens, in  Jack Hazan and David Mingay directed a picture called Rude Boy, about a genuinely lumpen young man who hangs out around The Clash long enough to become a roadie for the band.
  Negative
Its not a good film per se but its authentically grungy and purposefully uningratiating, and the band members, playing themselves, have the honesty to depict themselves as not-entirely-nice guys throughout.
  Positive
Not louts, but working performers who cant be around to hold anyone elses hand, to say the least.
  Positive
It might make an instructive double feature with this film, which is a confection by comparison.
  Neutral
