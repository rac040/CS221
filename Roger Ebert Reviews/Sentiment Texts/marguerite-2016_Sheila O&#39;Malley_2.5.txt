After Florence Foster Jenkins gave a concert at Carnegie Hall in  she rented the venue herself, Earl Wilson, the gossip columnist for the New York Post, observed drily, "She can sing anything but notes."
  Negative
Despite her notoriously screech-owl tones, Jenkins seemed to truly believe she was a brilliant coloratura soprano, and moved through the world in uninterrupted delusion.
  Positive
The crowds who flocked to her recitals watched with awed fascination, thinking, "Am I allowed to laugh at this?
  Neutral
Is she in on the joke?"
  Neutral
There are YouTube clips of her recordings.
  Negative
You may wonder, "How bad could she be?"
  Negative
Very, very bad as it turns out.
  Negative
The Csar-winning "Marguerite," directed by  Xavier Giannoli, moves the action to France, and features a riveting performance from  Catherine Frot as Marguerite.
  Positive
The script co-written by Giannoli and  Marcia Romano disintegrates in the too-lengthy final act, and an "explanation" is provided for what has really been going on with Marguerite all along.
  Negative
The explanation is a disappointment and not nearly as interesting as the main question that buzzes through the film, experienced by every person who comes into contact with Marguerite: Does she know how bad she is?
  Negative
How ... how can she notknow?
  Neutral
It's .
  Neutral
Marguerite Dumont lives on an estate in the French countryside with her husband Georges  Andr Marcon.
  Negative
She is an active member of the Amadeus Music Club they depend on her financial support and serves as the headliner for their concerts.
  Neutral
Georges writhes with embarrassment at his wife's insistence on singing publicly, but he has never pulled her aside in their  years of marriage and said, "Honey, you stink."
  Negative
How can he break the news to her now?
  Neutral
He is filled with guilt.
  Negative
He hides in his study.
  Positive
He watches her run around the yard in a Brnnhilde costume and knows he has helped create the lunatic asylum in which he lives.
  Positive
The opening sequence of "Marguerite," an Amadeus Club charity concert on the Dumont estate, is well-done, and Giannoli artfully creates a buildup of expectation for Marguerite's solo it is as though Maria Callas herself is about to appear.
  Positive
The main characters, those who will be drawn into Marguerite's circle, are introduced: Lucien, a young journalist  Sylvain Dieuaide' Lucien's monocle-wearing anarchist friend Kyril  Aubert Fenoy' Hazel  Christa Thret a young conservatory student.
  Negative
Marguerite, peacock feather on the top of her head, glides through the crowded room, taking her place by the piano.
  Very negative
It is as though she is used to singing for Shahs and Emperors.
  Negative
And then she launches into Mozart's tremendously difficult "Queen of the Night," and you hear the voice for the first time.
  Negative
Catherine Frot's valiant attempt to make it through that song is high comedy, but not just because of how badly she sings.
  Negative
It is clear that Marguerite knows what the song should sound like, and to her tone-deaf ears she sings it beautifully.
  Positive
The best part of Frot's performance, and the key to why "Marguerite" works when it does work, is how totally Marguerite believes in her nonexistent gift.
  Positive
Her manner is not imperious.
  Negative
She's as enthusiastic as a little girl.
  Positive
Her bows are the deep humble bows of a grande dame.
  Positive
Frot's Marguerite is a character study that refuses to explain all, even when the plot shovels in a disappointing explanation.
  Negative
Frot is so good that you understand why people who initially snicker Lucien, Kyril, Hazel come to care for her, even feel protective of her.
  Positive
Everyone erects a bubble of encouragement around her.
  Negative
The tone is set by Madelbos  Denis Mpunga, the intimidating Dumont butler, who acts as a fortress.
  Negative
Even Georges is afraid of Madelbos.
  Neutral
Madelbos organizes photo shoots for Marguerite, roping in the house servants as costumed extras.
  Negative
He's so terrifying that just a glance from him stops people from expressing anything other than glowing praise.
  Negative
Marguerite decides to put on a recital in a public venue, and, with the help of Lucien, hires washed-up opera singer Atos Pezzini  Michel Fau as a vocal coach.
  Negative
Pezzini is first seen onstage, grotesquely over-emoting as Pagliacci in a performance Marguerite thinks is marvelous.
  Positive
Pezzini scoffs at the thought of coaching an amateur, but he needs the money.
  Negative
He shows up at the Dumont house for their first session, so over-dressed and dandy-fied he looks like one of Tenniel's exaggerated drawings.
  Negative
Pezzini's stone-faced and yet panicked reaction to Marguerite's first note is the funniest moment in the film.
  Positive
Only his eyes move, flitting left, then right, like a trapped animal.
  Negative
The voice is hopeless, yet he throws himself into getting her into shape, in a "training montage," where he makes Marguerite gyrate her hips, rub her breasts, sing into a wall, and lie on the floor with giant books on her abdomen.
  Very negative
The ultimate question, the one that grounds "Marguerite," is: What is it like to love music as much as Marguerite Dumont and yet have no talent?
  Negative
But plenty of people love music passionately, can't sing a note, and don't lose one wink of sleep about it.
  Positive
You don't need to be able to sing "Queen of the Night" to appreciate it.
  Negative
Marguerite is reminiscent of Amanda Wingfield in Tennessee Williams' "The Glass Menagerie," so certain that a gentleman caller will arrive to court her disabled daughter that she will impale herself, and her family, on that doomed hope.
  Negative
Her life depends on it.
  Neutral
So does Marguerite's.
  Neutral
"Marguerite" is not afraid to laugh at its title character, but, and this is credit to both Giannoli and Frot, the film does not ask the audience to sneer at her.
  Negative
Yes, you want her to stop singing immediately because her lack of talent is titanic, but you don't want people to be mean to her.
  Negative
If someone had said to Marguerite early on, "Listen.
  Negative
You can't sing," would it have made a difference?
  Negative
Would she have been happy?
  Neutral
But Marguerite is undeniably happy when she sings.
  Positive
It's an ethical quandary, one the film has a lot of fun exploring.
  Very positive
Anyone who has watched "American Idol" is familiar with the expression of incomprehension on the faces of some contestants when they are given blunt criticism by one of the judges.
  Neutral
The contestants sound awesome to themselves.
  Neutral
They think that imitating Christina Aguilera's trills, or Beyonce's vibrato, is enough.
  Neutral
They think that if they want it badly enough, they should be able to have it.
  Negative
But art, especially singing, is a meritocracy.
  Positive
It's unfair, but there it is.
  Neutral
If you need Auto-Tune to correct every other note, maybe you don't have an aptitude for music.
  Negative
Dreams die hard, though.
  Negative
Delusions die even harder.
  Negative
"Marguerite" is too long, and the final section devolves into an entirely different film.
  Negative
The urge to "explain" Marguerite proved irresistible, but some things just can't be explained.
  Neutral
