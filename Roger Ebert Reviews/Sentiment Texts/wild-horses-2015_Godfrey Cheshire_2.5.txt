In his first film as writer-director-star since s  Assassination Tango,  Robert Duvall delivers a complex, ambitious genre piece that combines family drama and murder mystery, set in the south Texas ranch country.
  Positive
While the mix doesnt always cohere, the film boasts moments and scenes that rank with Duvalls best work.
  Positive
The tale begins with a scene so darkly lit and rapidly staged that its hard to tell exactly whats happening.
  Negative
But the gist soon becomes clear: Rancher Scott Briggs Duvall catches his youngest son engaged in sexual activity with another young man and throws both of them out into the dark, banishing his boy from his life with curses and furious urgings that he read the Bible.
  Negative
Fifteen years later, Briggs is the same cussed sonuvabitch but things are happening on two fronts that signal change in his settled life.
  Negative
For one thing, a Texas Ranger named Samantha Payne  Luciana Duvall, the filmmakers real-life wife is moving to reopen the case of the boy that Briggs caught with his son, who disappeared that same night.
  Positive
For another, the septuagenarian has decided its time to plan his estate, and that involves calling home the black sheep son he so unceremoniously ran off a decade and a half before.
  Negative
Ben Briggs  James Franco returns to the ranch looking as uncomfortable to see his father as the old man is to greet him.
  Negative
Years of suspicion, anger and hostility on both sides mean these two will have no easy time becoming reacquainted, much less reconciled.
  Negative
Ben gets a less frosty welcome from others on the ranch.
  Neutral
Older brother KC  Josh Hartnett has adopted his dads profession and lifestyle and pleased the old man by having a family of his own' he seems to have no trouble with his Bens sexuality that a little playful teasing wont resolve.
  Negative
And Ben shows real pleasure at reencountering Maria  Angie Cepeda, a Mexican house worker whos grown up with the family.
  Positive
Duvall does a good job evoking the spaces, rituals and characters of Briggs rough-hewn part of the country, and in suggesting how these have formed the paterfamilias split character.
  Positive
On the one hand, Scott is a staunch traditionalist who follows the Bible and no doubt considers himself a law-and-order conservative.
  Negative
On the other hand, hes got enough of the Wild West in him to take the law into his own hands when it suits him.
  Positive
The latter tendency leads him to fire on illegal immigrants trying to enter the U.S. on his land.
  Negative
It also prompts him to do something rash when he learns that the female Texas Ranger is reopening a case that he would prefer see forgotten: He contacts a corrupt cop he knows  Jim Parrack and asks that he makes sure Payne is stopped.
  Negative
Once the films story gets rolling, its clear were in for a bumpy ride in some ways that were intended and others that were not.
  Negative
Most significantly, the tales two main plot strands the murder investigation and the tortuous family reunion unfurl rather awkwardly at times and intersect with each other unconvincingly.
  Negative
There are plot holes that call attention to themselves, as well as some missed dramatic opportunities especially concerning the characters played by Hartnett and Cepeda that contribute to the storys impression of hasty, unfinished contrivance.
  Negative
At the same time, Duvall is such a master actor that the vehicle hes created for himself works fascinatingly as such.
  Positive
Scott Briggs is a multi-dimensional character whos in the process of changing as he contemplates his death.
  Negative
Can he come to terms with his demons, or will he add news sins to the old ones as he tries?
  Neutral
In almost every scene where his character appears, Duvall adds nuances and details that make the man both dynamic and unsettling, which results in a number of dramatic passages that are surprisingly powerful.
  Positive
He does a good job with the other actors too, but the stand-out here is Franco, who adds another item to his Queer Studies portfolio but does so in a way that avoids clich and obviousness in favor of wit, strength and subtlety.
  Positive
The relationship between rancher dad and gay son is not only at the emotional heart of Wild Horses, its also the key to the films thoughtful, humane thematic gist, and the work of two fine actors helps make that difficult conjunction a believable and memorable one.
  Very positive
