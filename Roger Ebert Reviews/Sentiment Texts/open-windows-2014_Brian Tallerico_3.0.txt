Heavily inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's influence on  Brian De Palma, Nacho Vigalondos Open Windows goes from crazy to Crazy to CRAZY, but maintains enough energy and cultural currency to keep the entertainment value high.
  Positive
Its one of those admittedly silly films that moves so quickly that one rarely has time to question its logic.
  Negative
Consider that a piece of advice.
  Positive
If you think about any of the dozen or so twists in Open Windows for even a few seconds, the entire exercise falls apart.
  Negative
However, theres enough filmmaking skill and an enticing melting pot of commentary on celebrity and hacker culture to keep it humming.
  Neutral
Its nonsense, but its glorious nonsense.
  Negative
Nick Chambers  Elijah Wood runs a website devoted to his favorite starlet, Jill Goddard  Sasha Grey, star of a series of sci-fi action flicks called Dark Sky.
  Negative
Jill is appearing at a convention in Austin, where Nick has been told he has won a blogger contest to have dinner with his beloved actress.
  Negative
Sitting in his hotel room, watching Jills latest public appearance online, Nick gets a call from a mysterious man named Chord  Neil Maskell.
  Negative
The man on the other end of the line begins to manipulate Nick, telling him that Jill has canceled their date before giving the fan access to her cell phone.
  Negative
They can see and hear Jills every action, including breaking up with her actor boyfriend and going to meet her new beau in the same hotel at which Nick is staying.
  Negative
At first, its  Rear Window with modern technology the pane of glass replaced by a smartphone, the new way to play peeping tom.
  Negative
The first act feels like a clever commentary on how much celebrities owe us, especially in the era of the hacked celebrity photos scandal.
  Negative
Then Nick leaves his room.
  Neutral
At the end of the stellar first act, Nick starts running around the halls with his laptop, playing puppet on a string to Chords demands and Open Windows goes from thriller to insanity.
  Negative
Did I mention yet that the whole thing takes place on that laptop screen?
  Neutral
Yes, its a series of open windows, displaying Nicks webcam, Jills phone cam, a dashboard cam, etc.
  Positive
Its a clever concept that threatens to completely collapse, especially when Vigalondo tries to stage a car chase with this structure, but it never quite does.
  Neutral
Again, its the kind of thing that if one questions with any sort of intensity, their eyes will roll.
  Positive
And yet, thanks in large part to incredibly tight editing by Bernat Vilaplana, I kept my disbelief suspended.
  Positive
Its a gimmick that so openly announces and presents itself that its hard to criticize.
  Negative
As De Palma often did in his crazier moments, its a filmmaker who knows hes pushing the boundaries of logic but does so with just the right amount of confidence.
  Positive
And Open Windows gets crazier and crazier, which Ive always considered a positive thing.
  Positive
I have a much bigger problem with films that pretend to be extreme than those that go off the rails.
  Negative
Open Windows flies off the rails of logic in style.
  Negative
Mostly.
  Neutral
There could have been a few more believable reactions by the people involved in this insanity.
  Negative
Nick so openly does whatever Chord says in the first act that its hard to believe hes ever even seen a movie much less runs a website devoted to them.
  Neutral
Didnt he see  Grand Piano, another Wood vehicle from this year that featured a distant tormentor and could be called De Palma-esque?
  Negative
Its a product of the plot that Nick openly accepts as much as he does.
  Neutral
As is the fact that Jill quickly follows almost every order.
  Negative
Theyre cogs in Vigalondos machine as much as Chords elaborate plan.
  Negative
And yet my problems with the shallow characters of Open Windows are offset by the tight pacing and, even more than that, the cultural commentary for which Vigalondo aims as a writer.
  Negative
Hes playing with the era of anonymity.
  Neutral
It actually makes sense that Nick would be more likely to trust a voice on a laptop than it might have ten years ago, given how much we are all living electronically.
  Negative
The combination of anonymity on the internet with a complete lack of privacy in celebrity culture creates a fascinating crossroads in Open Windows.
  Positive
How many people out there dont even want to use their real names online but expect to know every little detail about their favorite actress?
  Negative
Vigalondo stages the only kind of thriller he could in this pop culture dichotomy a crazy one.
  Negative
