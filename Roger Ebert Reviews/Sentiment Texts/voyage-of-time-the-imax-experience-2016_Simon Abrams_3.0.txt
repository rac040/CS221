In , noted author and personal hero  Harlan Ellison chided me for saying that the reprinting of some of his short stories was "awesome."
  Negative
"The Grand Canyon is 'awesome,'" he shouted theatrically.
  Negative
"The Heavenly Cosmos are 'awesome!'
  Positive
This?
  Neutral
Maybe interesting.
  Positive
But definitely not 'awesome!'"
  Positive
I thought about that definition of "awesome" as I watched the -minute cut of writerdirector Terrence Malick's cosmic nature documentary "Voyage of Time: The IMAX Experience."
  Negative
Malick's film, a combination of gorgeous documentary footage and vividly detailed computer-generated imagery, is majestic but so broad in its scope that I left it feeling like I'd seen something beautiful whose spark of genius only lasted as long as it was in front of my eyes.
  Very positive
Malick's idiosyncratic marriage of spiritual speculation and nature photography isfrequently amazing.
  Positive
But altogetherawesome?
  Neutral
Not quite.
  Neutral
Narrated throughout by  Brad Pitt, "Voyage of Time" starts at the beginning of time and ends with the demise of the world as we know it.
  Negative
We see swirling nebulae, smoky volcanoes and multiplyingbacteria while Pitt tells us about the "restless" character of life.
  Positive
Malick has an elemental view of life's origins, so Pitt offers general poetic speculations instead of specific information about what we're looking at.
  Positive
He suggests, in his placating authorial whisper, that "Nature" is constantly perfecting life on Earth.
  Positive
"Death" pushes Life along towards "Perfection."
  Neutral
"Community" leads to the individual "Self," and we witness a vast array of crabs piling onto and climbing over each other.
  Positive
Life teems with mysterious "Goodness" as translucentwhite jellyfish float gently towards the water's surface.
  Positive
There's something fundamentally sanitized about this dreamy, placid view of life.
  Negative
Ellison once said that life was a series of confrontations.
  Neutral
But Love unites Malick's world, as we see when two blue whales hover near each other.
  Neutral
And we are just like the dinosaurs, since we also have the capacity to feel affection for each other and, yes, to feel awe.
  Positive
But there is no violence in Malick's world, just a cycle of becoming that comes to an end for one large fish after he's bitten bya sea lion.
  Negative
Herons dive deep into the ocean and pick at a school offish, who rally in unison to escape.
  Negative
Life thrives, just as Malick insists that "dark" is necessarily "bound" to "light."
  Neutral
We see humanity in a flurry of images at the end of this cut of "Voyage of Time," because our story is the same as the story of growing trees, cooling Earth, and the catastrophicmeteor that salted the Earth with plant-killing ash.
  Negative
Or at least, that's what an introductory scrolling text suggests when it tells us that we are seeing ourselves when we examine the objects and animals in the film.
  Neutral
I struggle with Malick's expressive, supra-human vision of life because its philosophy is bound up in its simultaneously pat and viscerally enchanting expression.
  Negative
I knew something was off when footage of computer-generated dinosaurs left me cold.
  Negative
Similar dino footage used in Malick's majestic " The Tree of Life," a superiorcompanion film that shares footage and a general outlook with "Voyage of Time," felt genuinely mysterious because of contextualizing footage.
  Negative
The narration is similarly nuanced in that earlier film while it is purposefully simplified in "Voyage of Time."
  Negative
These two films provide fundamentally different viewing experiences: "The Tree of Life" pulls you along with the speed and variety of life as it's experienced from a God's eye view while "Voyage of Time" summarizes that perspective, putting it in terms that a "child" could understand.
  Positive
We are all "children of the Good," we are told, because we are just another part of Nature's constant yearning for Perfection.
  Positive
Still,it isexciting to see such a personal theological vision writ large on an IMAX screen.
  Positive
Who else butMalick could make me puzzle over the meaning of adescriptionof a"pre-mammalian"quadrupedlizard creature?
  Negative
What other documentarian would revel in the unfathomable passage of time while also presuming to speak of a Natural plan?What other storyteller wouldhave the audacity to make a cinematic poem that'slargely comprised of documentary footage, andbookended bysimulated versions of theBig Bang andEarth's destruction?
  Neutral
What's my problem anyway?
  Neutral
I don't know how to answer that last question, but I can tell you somethingEllison wrote, this time in a  issue ofFuture Life.
  Negative
In a column later anthologizedin hisAn Edge in My Voiceessaycollection, Ellison rhapsodizes eloquently about the Voyager I mission.
  Positive
He was awed, then crestfallen at the thought of the news cycle concentratingon the war between Iran and Iraq, and not NASA's latest photographs and speculations about the spokes on Saturn's rings.
  Negative
"Ain't we a wonderful species," he muses sarcastically after reveling for thousands of words in the thrill of discovery, and the shock of the new provided by NASA's scientists.
  Positive
I didn't need "Voyage of Time" to confirm my spiritualpoint-of-view to be great: I just wish it werea little less flat.
  Negative
As it is, Malick's film feels incomplete, like a sampler platter version of a hearty meal.
  Negative
Awesome?
  Positive
Maybe not.
  Neutral
But intriguing?
  Positive
Oh my yes.
  Neutral
