There's a kind of s American movie that's catnip to directors who grew up in the 's and 's while watching that sort of movie on cable TV and home video.
  Negative
It's visually and thematically dark, and very male.
  Positive
It has Rembrandt lighting and a palette dominated by paper-bag brown, burnt yellow, leprous emerald, and dirty cream.
  Negative
There's talk of honor and integrity and tradition, of old ways passing and a meaner, pettier, more chaotic, new way taking its place.
  Positive
It is an organized crime film, or a family drama, or a big city nightmare, or all three things at once.
  Negative
Nobody in it is conventionally likable.
  Positive
The hero, despite a certain reticence about selling what's left of his soul, soon figures out that to get ahead in this world, you have to be cold and calculating, and divest yourself of illusions.
  Negative
"A Most Violent Year," a  New York period piece written and directed by J.C. Chandor "All is Lost," " Margin Call", is that kind of movie.
  Negative
Oh, boy, is it that kind of movie.
  Positive
It's quite good, for what it is.
  Very positive
But it's that "for what it is" part that proves slightly exasperating.
  Positive
Oscar Isaac plays the hero, Abel Morales, who runs a heat oil company that he took over from his father-in-law.
  Negative
He just bought a port property and has a month to cobble together enough investors to pay for it in full, otherwise he'll have to eat the down payment and go broke.
  Negative
It's a major gamble that could pay off big if a few key things go right for him, but in this kind of movie, the "if"s rarely break the hero's way.
  Negative
He is under investigation for business, um, irregularities' the D.A.  David Oyelowo of " Selma" is riding him like an old dray horse.
  Negative
As if that's not enough pressure, Abel's company is under pressure from competitors.
  Negative
Worse, somebody's started hijacking his trucks: this happens in the opening sequence as he and his lawyer, Andrew  Albert Brooks, sly and smart and nearly unrecognizable, as is often the case these days, are delivering the down payment.
  Positive
We don't know who's behind the violence against Abel's company.
  Negative
We just know that he's scrambling to put this deal together and only has a month to do it, and that his wife Anna  Jessica Chastain, doing a credible Brooklyn accent, is not making things any easier for him.
  Negative
She's a tough-as-nails ally and confidant "My husband is an honest man, don't mistake his honesty for weakness," she tells another character, as well as a wily bookkeeper.
  Negative
But she's also a borderline Lady Macbeth figure who often chides her husband for not being as hard as he should be, because this is a hard, shadowy world, and these are mean streets.
  Very negative
The movie follows Abel andor Anna as they try to get money to save their collective enterprise.
  Negative
Probably a third of the tale occurs during conversations between scowling men seated across tables in dimly-lit rooms.
  Neutral
This is mesmerizing, up to a point, thanks to Isaac's cinematically borrowed but still palpable magnetism and the coiled intensity of the supporting players, and from cinematographer Bradford Young's lighting, which imparts a purgatorial gloom to conversations about capital and interest, respect and disrespect.
  Very positive
The film's title refers to an actual, statistical designation:  was the most violent year in New York City history up till that point, with, homicides the number climbed through  before starting to level off.
  Negative
Coupled with the retro look and rhythm and subject matter the film is a dirty business movie, a crime film, a crusading New York DA story, and a visual homage to cinematographer  Gordon Willis " The Godfather," " The Conversation", and a lot of other 's-film signifiers as well it all feels like a romanticization of a past which, through a twenty-teens, American middle-class filmmaker's eyes , looks like a Brigadoon of urban ethnic machismo.
  Negative
The movie is so funereal that at times it plays like a memorial service, not just for a particular kind of American drama, but for the male heroes who populated them: a snapshot of one of the last cultural moments when American men could be Men, in that old fashioned, two-fisted, furrowed-brow-and-whispered-threats sort of way .
  Negative
The American director  James Gray also has made this kind of sideways homage, channeling the gangster pictures of  Martin Scorsese and  Francis Coppola and the big city thrillers of  Sidney Lumet "Serpico", with a more meditative pace.
  Positive
S ections of this movie are reminiscent of Gray's " The Yards," which was equal parts " On the Waterfront" and "The Godfather," and his followup, the gangster pictureundercover cop thriller " We Own the Night" which, like "A Most Violent Year," is fitfully excellent, but sometimes tries too hard to be a K-Tel Greatest 's Macho Movie Hits album.
  Negative
Chandor's film ultimately has its own vibe, though, which is no small feat considering the heavy legacy it bears.
  Negative
The look and performances carry it.
  Positive
There's outstanding use of New York locations, some cunningly staged moments of suspense and violence, and smart deployment of TV newscasts as a mostly unremarked-upon Greek chorus.
  Negative
Even when the financial conversations and fine-grained discussion of traditions and codes become repetitive, and even though Chastain is slightly underused, "A Most Violent Year" makes an impression.
  Very negative
It's still not the best tribute to American New Wave cinema in theaters this year: that would be " Inherent Vice," a meandering yet vibrant piece that seems to have fully absorbed all the different bits of popular art that fed its writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson's aesthetic, and that seems to have nothing to prove and is content to simply be.
  Negative
Gray's "Godfather II" inspired " The Immigrant" is also excellent, and likewise steeped in post-Vietnam America's cinema traditions, although it's gentler, told from a female perspective, and set more deeply in the past.
  Very positive
Chandor, in contrast, doesn't achieve the same imaginative freedom in "A Most Violent Year," but he's a potentially major talent, emphasis on potentially.
  Positive
If this movie comes on television, you'll watch most of it, though there's a good chance that at certain points you'll wish you were watching the films that inspired it.
  Positive
