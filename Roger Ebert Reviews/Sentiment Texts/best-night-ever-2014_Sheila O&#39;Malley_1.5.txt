There are two scenes in  Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer's "Best Night Ever" that work: they are screwball and goofy which, unfortunately, only serve to highlight the fun film it could have been.
  Negative
In one, the four heroines crouch in a dumpster, hiding from the cops, all in the frame at once.
  Negative
The other is a long montage sequence where they race around Las Vegas carrying out various "Bachelorette Party" games like "Scare Someone", "Create a Flash Mob", or "Kiss Someone With a Mustache".
  Negative
The four actresses are funny and ridiculous and toss themselves into the story with gusto.
  Negative
But these sequences are surrounded by scenes collapsing with dead air, contrived plot twists, and an underlying persistent racism.
  Negative
Bride-to-be Claire  Desiree Hall heads to Las Vegas for her bachelorette party.
  Negative
She's joined by her uptight sister Leslie  Samantha Colburn, who keeps shooting eye-daggers at Claire's best friend from childhood Zoe  Eddie Ritchard, who is filming the whole thing.
  Negative
Driving the car is Janet  Crista Flanagan, another friend.
  Negative
The mishaps begin immediately.
  Negative
Leslie's credit card is denied at the plush hotel.
  Neutral
They end up in a filthy motel offering hourly rates.
  Negative
Claire's dildo-decorated tiara bursts into flames and chunks of her hair fall out.
  Negative
Zoe tries to buy cocaine from a valet because, of course, all valets are drug dealers and he ends up mugging them at gunpoint, stealing Claire's engagement ring.
  Negative
There's more, including a lap dance gone wrong, copious shots of alcohol, a stolen limousine, and a disastrous Jello wrestling contest.
  Negative
There's also a " Spring Breakers" knockoff scene in which the girls don ski masks and try to get the ring back.
  Negative
All of this action is filmed by the main characters, passing the camera off to each other.
  Negative
The herky-jerky style doesn't feel suited to this material.
  Negative
Producer  Jason Blum heads up the " Paranormal Activity" franchise, and there it works, because what we can't see is often more frightening than what we can.
  Positive
Friedberg and Seltzer use the same found-footage style in "Best Night Ever" and it's a mistake.
  Negative
Comedy requires a more delicate, specific touch, but here, the air is slowly let out of the balloon as the scenes limp forward.
  Negative
It's not an accident that the two best sequences I mentioned are either completely stationary or cut together in a traditional montage style.
  Negative
The treatment of minorities in the film is appalling, the worst example being a naked heavyset black woman who turns into a literal Movie Monster, chasing the girls, attacking them, and re-emerging again and again in ever-more threatening ways.
  Very negative
That the filmmakers think she's hilarious enough to bring back in the coda might be the most disturbing touch of all.
  Positive
