My first reaction to having to watch yet another  zombie movie?
  Negative
Ugh.
  Neutral
I decided to swear them off after the rather  toothless PG- version of " World War Z".
  Neutral
And this is coming from an idolizer  of  George Romeros early and much-imitated body of work.
  Negative
But  it didnt take long for "The Returned" to establish itself as having more  ambition than just being another excuse for flesh-eating monsters to  run amok while humans attempt to eradicate their organ-gorging kind.
  Negative
Instead, it is less of a horror flick and more of a suspense thriller with  sci-fi elements that possesses both brainssome sacrificed in messy  fashion, of courseand a heart, as it makes a statement about an  imaginary social issue that reflects those conflicts facing our country  today.
  Positive
Instead of, say, the haves  vs. the have-nots or legislation against illegal immigrants, there is a  battle between the healthy and the infected.
  Negative
A zombie outbreak that  happened a while ago that caused millions to die has since been  contained, thanks to a miracle of modern medicine.
  Positive
If caught in time,  those bitten can receive a daily shot to stave off their transformation  into snarling blood-thirsty fiends.
  Negative
These beings who find themselves in  this human-zombie limbo are known as the Returned and not everyone is  happy about their presence.
  Negative
Exemplifying  this new normal is Toronto couple Kate  Emily Hampshire, a near-ringer  for  Parker Posey and Alex  Kris Holden-Ried, a near-ringer for musician  Richard Thompson.
  Negative
She is a doctor who specializes in treating the  Returned and he is a talented guitar teacher who happens to be one of  the Returned.
  Positive
That they live in a fabulous high-rise condo with  ultra-modern furnishings and seem mad for each other lead us to believe  that such a situation might work.
  Negative
Kate,  who keeps her conflict of interest hidden from others at the hospital,  over-confidently explains to the rightfully concerned parents of a young  boy who must be injected every day for the rest of his life that,  Being one of the Returned is a privilege, not a curse.
  Negative
Of course, she  is just setting herself up to be proven wrong.
  Negative
Sure  enough, the supply of antiviral serum is in danger of being depleted.
  Negative
Research is underway to create a synthetic variety but may not be  available as quickly as first thought.
  Negative
The pending drought increases the  opposition to keeping the infected alive.
  Positive
Some want to quarantine these  stigmatized survivors, while others stage protests against their very  existence.
  Negative
As matters worsen and  violence breaks out as the stock continues to dwindle, Katewho  already was getting Alexs supply under the counterdecides its  time to they go on the run and hide out with the help of their  supportive friends, who offer refuge at their remote chalet.
  Negative
From  there, "The Returned"s plot direction too often settles for being more  predictable than its initial setup.
  Negative
I found myself thinking uh-oh  again and again as the story took another expected turn.
  Negative
Hint: If you  walk into an unmanned gas station in a zombie movie, chances are that  noise in the back room is probably a sign to flee, not a reason to check  out what is going on.
  Negative
But  director  Manuel Carballo offsets the lack of surprise with such efficient suspense builders as propulsive music, ambient noise,  realistic lighting and judicious handheld camerawork while efficiently  explaining the science and politics behind what is happening.
  Negative
What is  most appreciated is the sense of everyday routine that he createsyou  feel as if this could really happen right here, right nowand the fact  that the sensitive, low-key performances by Hampshire and Holden-Ried keep the viewer invested in what happens to their relationship.
  Positive
"Warm  Bodies" was one thing.
  Positive
But these are two adults trying to keep their love  alive under horrible circumstances and it is compelling to watch.Carballo  knows when to be playfula judicious use of a clip from Bela Lugosis  "Dracula" appears on TV just as the power goes outand also understands  when to be true to zombie lore.
  Very positive
As he and everyone who has seen "Night  of the Living Dead" know, a Romero-approved shot to the head is still the  best way to stop a zombie for good.
  Positive
