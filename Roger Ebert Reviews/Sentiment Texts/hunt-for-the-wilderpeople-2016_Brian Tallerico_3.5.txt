Taika Waititis Hunt for the Wilderpeople shouldnt work.
  Negative
Its the kind of project thats difficult to describe without making it sound clichd and sentimental.
  Negative
Its another coming-of-age tale, this one of a troubled teenager finding his place in the world deep in the mountains, with a man who never thought hed be a father figure.
  Positive
And yet Waititis film defies its convention through grounded characters, witty dialogue, compassionate filmmaking and inventive storytelling.
  Positive
Hunt for the Wilderpeople is consistently clever and even moving.
  Very positive
Its proof that well keep listening to the familiar stories if theyre this well-told.
  Positive
Teenager Ricky  Julian Dennison is introduced as a real bad egg.
  Negative
Hes been shuttled around foster homes, getting in trouble for random juvenile things like loitering and graffiti.
  Negative
His officer, Paula  Rachel House takes No Child Left Behind as a threat, not a comfort, focusing on Ricky like a problem that needs to be solved.
  Negative
Shes the kind of authority figure who sets Ricky up for failure, listing his problems instead of his qualities.
  Negative
And shes immediately tonally offset by Rickys new mother, Bella  Rima Te Wiata, the kind of woman who wears sweaters with cat faces on them and hugs with her whole body.
  Negative
But Bella is no softie.
  Negative
She wins Ricky over by being honest, saying things like Have some breakfast  then you can run away.
  Positive
Theres a telling but brief exchange Waititi never hammers or underlines his themes in which Bella and Ricky see some wild horses and the young man asks if he can ride them.
  Negative
She responds, Why do they need to be ridden anyway?
  Negative
Why cant they just eat grass and be happy?
  Neutral
Shes essentially telling Ricky shell give him the same freedom.
  Negative
Of course, nothing that great lasts and Ricky ends up on the run for reasons I wont spoil.
  Negative
Deep in the forest, Ricky plans a life living off the land with his dog Tupac.
  Negative
Hes tracked and found by Bellas husband Hec  Sam Neill, who gets injured, delaying their return to civilization long enough that the authorities come looking.
  Negative
Hec and Ricky are a traditional oil-and-water movie duo, physically and emotionally off-set.
  Positive
Ricky writes haikus.
  Negative
Hec hunts.
  Neutral
And the two become famous, all over national news and tracked by the incompetent Paula.
  Negative
Hunt for the Wilderpeople becomes a road movie with no road, a film about two people who may seem entirely different but have both been discarded by society.
  Negative
Waititis film never judges its characters.
  Negative
Ricky isnt a bad egg or a dumb kid.
  Negative
The film finds joy in scenes like the one in which he creates a fake Walkman and dances to the music in his head.
  Positive
Its essential to the films success that Rickys not just the bumbling idiot he could have been in another filmmakers hands.
  Negative
We feel honest affection for Ricky.
  Positive
And the same holds true for Hec, whom Waititi and Neill could have turned into a grizzled jerk.
  Negative
Dennison, Waititi and Neill find depth within the characters, as small moments become the foundation for the films emotion.
  Negative
They dont play the coming-of-age arc, they play the reality of each scene.
  Neutral
It may sound obvious, but so many films like Hunt for the Wilderpeople try to play the emotion instead of grounding it in character.
  Negative
It helps to have a compassionate and humane filmmaker in the directors chair.
  Very positive
The man behind  Boy and  What We Do in the Shadows not only knows how hit a comedy beat with perfect timing, but he knows the rhythm a piece like this needs to work.
  Positive
With a fantastic editing team theres a sequence set to Nina Simone's Sinnerman, of all things, that is perfectly conceived and executed, he breaks Hunt for the Wilderpeople up into chapters, making it feel almost like a memory or the story that an adult Ricky is telling his kids later in life.
  Negative
It almost approaches fairy tale mythology, especially the surprisingly action-packed finale, one in which we honestly care about the fate of our two protagonists.
  Very positive
So much of Hunt for the Wilderpeople looks easy.
  Negative
Its not until one considers the number of places it could have gone awry that one truly appreciates it.
  Neutral
There are so many minor beats that produce laughs and major moments that create surprising emotion.
  Positive
Theres a great scene halfway through in which Hec and Ricky are high enough in the mountains that they can almost touch the sky and Hec calls it majestical.
  Positive
Its not a real word, but we know what it means.
  Neutral
Its the meaning that matters in Hunt for the Wilderpeople.
  Neutral
It's a downright majestical movie.
  Negative
