There are movies about ugly, vile people, and there are ugly, vile movies.
  Very negative
Triple  is the latter.
  Positive
Turning his interest in macho nihilism that he explored more effectively in  The Proposition and even the flawed  Lawless to bank robbers and the Russian mob, director John Hillcoat again assembles a stunning cast of household names and proceeds to waste almost all of their talents on an under-lit, increasingly ridiculous, generally ineffective dirty cop movie.
  Negative
It is a film that cribs openly from Michael Mann and  Sidney Lumet without understanding what really makes either director work.
  Negative
Occasionally, the overwhelming talent of the cast will elevate the material, but not nearly enough to shake the feeling when its done that you could use a shower.
  Negative
The best scene in Triple  is arguably its first real set-piece, the robbery of a downtown Atlanta bank by former special ops mastermind Michael Atwood  Chiwetel Ejiofor, dirty cop  Marcus Belmont  Anthony Mackie, dirty cop  Jorge Rodriguez Clifton Collins Jr., getaway man Russel Welch  Norman Reedus, and his brother Gabe  Aaron Paul, a character who might as well being wearing a red shirt and named Future Liability.
  Negative
Hillcoat and cinematographer  Nicolas Karakatsanis The Drop frame the bank robbery beautifully, taking us from the high-pressure of the vault to the getaway gone wrong after a red dye pack explodes.
  Positive
Its tense, well-shot and sets up the audience for a high stakes thriller that never comes.
  Positive
It turns out the quintet wasnt there for the money they were tasked with stealing a very specific safety deposit box by Russian mob mastermind Irina Vlaslov  Kate Winslet, who is now refusing to pay the group until they perform another job.
  Negative
Irina has control over Michael because Michael has a son with Irinas sister Elena  Gal Gadot that the Russians are basically holding hostage, not allowing his father to see him.
  Negative
This plot thread is not only poorly-developed, its a little morally grotesque in that it feels designed to create sympathy for someone who should be a villain, especially when we learn what the title means.
  Negative
If you dont know,  is the code for officer down.
  Negative
In their planning of the second heist, which involves a Homeland Security building, the group decides that the best way to distract the rest of the force will be to kill a cop.
  Negative
As they say, every car responds to a triple nine.
  Negative
And theyll all be distracted enough to not be able to respond to the new heist.
  Negative
Conveniently, Marcus gets a green new partner in Chris Allen  Casey Affleck.
  Positive
Theyll set up Allen to get killed, and pull off one final job for Irina while the city is descending on the crime scene.
  Negative
They never bother to consider that Allens uncle  Woody Harrelson is leading the investigation into who they are.
  Negative
Or that the increasingly unstable Gabe is a problem.
  Neutral
Or that their entire plan is based on a lot of coincidences and plot holes that we only see in movies.
  Neutral
Most of Triple  is shot in close-up and near-total darkness.
  Neutral
Hillcoat and Karakatsanis mistakenly think that this will compensate for a lack of character or plot worth caring about.
  Negative
So, we get sweaty, dirty, grimy camerawork, under-lit to a nearly-parodic degree, but none of it resonates beyond showy filmmaking.
  Negative
The film is constantly calling attention to its visual style or lack thereof because theres so little else on which to focus.
  Negative
Despite casting so many talented people, writer  Matt Cook and Hillcoat give them almost nothing to do.
  Negative
They are cogs in a plot machine with nothing notable about their characters or back stories outside of the descriptions you read above.
  Negative
Michael has a kid.
  Neutral
Gabe is the junkie.
  Negative
Chris is the new guy.
  Neutral
That is it.
  Neutral
If Hillcoat is trying to say anything about macho male behavior, the police force, capitalism, or even the Russian mob, he fails to do so.
  Negative
The forgettable thinness of the characters is problematic throughout but especially in the final act when one realizes you just dont care about these people or whats going to happen to them.
  Very negative
If one subscribes to the theory that people can learn as much from a bad movie as from a good one, watch the scenes between two of our best actors Kate Winslet and Chiwetel Ejiofor.
  Negative
Neither have the depth of character or artful purpose that these two have brought to films before.
  Neutral
And so their relationship, one of the defining ones of the film, has no resonance at all.
  Negative
To be fair, Anthony Mackie has so much natural charisma that it shines through every now and then and Casey Affleck sometimes looks like hes aware of the better film in which this character could play a crucial role.
  Positive
Its also worth noting that when character has to take a back seat in a few action sequences, including a riveting gang shoot-out, the movie works.
  Positive
Its when dialogue and an increasingly-ludicrous plot kicks in that the movie fails in head-shaking ways.
  Negative
Every talented cast member will move on from the errors of Triple  and on to bigger and better things.
  Positive
Most of them have already.
  Neutral
Follow their lead.
  Neutral
