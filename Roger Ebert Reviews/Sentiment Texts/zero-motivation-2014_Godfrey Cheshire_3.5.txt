Like classic military comedies from  Catch- to  MASH, Talya Lavies Zero Motivation offers its own appealing blend of irreverence and absurdism.
  Positive
But what makes the film so original is not that distinction, or the greater one that the soldiers observed here are female and Israeli.
  Negative
The films real difference, rather, lies in a kind of cinematic intelligence that unveils itself very gradually and subtly.
  Positive
This reviewer, for example, thought he had the film sized up roughly a third of the way through.
  Positive
Another third later, he realized his earlier approximate certainty had come far too soon.
  Negative
And by the end, he was impressed in a way that he hadnt imagined he would be even a few minutes before.
  Negative
These shifting perspectives are worth noting as a way of describing how Zero Motivation, unlike most films currently, doesnt try to create a single impression early on that will simply be extended and amplified as the narrative continues.
  Negative
Rather, it deepens and changes it goes along, ending up far richer and more resonant than many viewers will expect initially.
  Very positive
This, in part, emerges from the narrative being structured as three consecutive stories about the same set of characters: soldiers who work in boring low-level jobs as paper-pushers at a military base in southern Israel.
  Negative
The first tale centers on the fraught friendship of two of these women.
  Positive
As it opens, they are returning to the base and nervy, sharp-edged Zohar Dana Ivgy is doing what she can to help and placate petulant, recessive Daffi  Nelly Tagar, everything from saving her a seat on the bus to carrying her pack when they have to leave their ride and walk.
  Negative
Zohar, we quickly see, is happy as long as shes with Daffi and they are engaged in some of the silly pastimes that make up their normal routine, like singing pop songs and playing video games on their work computers.
  Negative
For her part, Daffi isnt made happy by any of this.
  Positive
She hates the base, is merely killing time with Zohar, and has been aggressively petitioning her superiors for a transfer to Tel Aviv.
  Negative
Its a mark of the films complexity that, even while describing the evolving emotional snarls between these two women, it also provides detailed portraits of several other characters.
  Positive
One, Rama Shani Klein, the office commander, is a typical autocrat in some ways, yet is also ambitious to an extent that makes her both pliant and uncertain.
  Negative
Then theres the latest woman to appear on base, whom Daffis convinced is the replacement that will allow her leave for Tel Aviv until a dark and bizarre incident proves otherwise.
  Neutral
Through much of the story, underlying sexual tensions seem to explain certain aspects of how the characters behave.
  Negative
Yet things are never exactly as they first appear.
  Negative
When the tales second part begins, for example, the sense that Zohar may be motivated by a lesbian attraction to Daffi is displaced by another twist: after being chided by her fellows for being the lone virgin in their group, she sets out to snare a man.
  Negative
Theres a war on, a character says at one point in the film.
  Negative
Soldiers are dying.
  Neutral
We never do learn which war exactly, or who the enemy is.
  Negative
But rather than damning Zero Motivation for lacking political and historical specificity, this ambiguity underlines its emotional and thematic acuity.
  Negative
In essence, theres always a war on, and not just in Israel or the Middle East.
  Negative
Put any group of untethered individuals, male or female, together in a closed, pressured situation and a war will soon erupt.
  Negative
Here, the weapons are words, paper and staple guns, but the conflicts are no less seriousand sometimes violentfor that.
  Negative
By the time the narrative reaches its final section, its clear that there will be no easy outs or simple solutions for any of the main characters.
  Negative
Some will climb the career ladder, others will end up in the brig' but the war will continue, at varying degrees of intensity, as long as they are in the militaryand perhaps well after.
  Negative
At the same time, though, these soldiers are not simply rats in a maze.
  Negative
They are complicated people who grow and learn, although their changes sometimes entail torturous challenges.
  Neutral
As this debut feature proves, Talya Lavie has extraordinary gifts as both a writer and a director.
  Positive
Her scripts narrative is shrewd and cleverly wrought to a fault, with no end of unexpected turns and well-drawn characters.
  Negative
It also has the virtue of never sacrificing perceptive thoughtfulness to laughs, its comedy being commendably of the most oblique, understated sort.
  Positive
As director, Lavie gets terrific performances out all of her main actors, and has a keen flair for comic and dramatic timing.
  Very positive
In sum, Zero Motivation is not only a pleasure in itself but also seems to signal the beginning of an important career.
  Negative
