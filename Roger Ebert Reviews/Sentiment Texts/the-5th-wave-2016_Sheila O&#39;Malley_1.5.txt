  Negative
Close-ups of Moretz's terrified face predominate throughout.
  Negative
Cassie's voiceover then kicks in, informing us that before all this, she was a "normal" teenage girl.
  Negative
Those words are a betrayal of the character  Rick Yancey created in his popular YA series.
  Neutral
There's nothing "normal" about Cassie in the book, but onscreen, Moretz hasn't been given a character she can sink her teeth into.

  Negative
What would have happened if Cassie had been rescued by a guy who looked like  Wilford Brimley?

  Negative

  Negative
The trash-talking kid-soldiers play poker in their barracks, go through weapons training, all under the watchful eye of Colonel Vosch's hard-assed medical assistant  Maria Bello.

  Negative
The child is only three feet tall.
  Neutral
His rifle is taller than he is.

She can shoot a moving target.
  Positive
The strengths of director J. Blakeson and production designer  Jon Billington lie in the apocalyptic wasteland scenes: a highway filled with crashed cars, corpses piled up, orange fires raging through a dark landscape.
  Negative
The colors are sometimes too bright for such a grim story, and the shatteringof group trauma isn't present the way it is in the opening scenes of " The Hunger Games".
  Negative

  Negative
In the book Cassie is ravaged by grief and rage.
  Negative
Here, she just seems slightly put-out and sometimes super-scared.
  Negative
Moretz is an excellent actress but she is unable to give Cassie the depth that "The th Wave" needs.

  Positive
Details matter.
  Neutral
"The th Wave" is Dystopia-Lite.
  Positive
When a book is adapted for the screen, there are reasons why some tangential plot points need to go.
  Negative
But  Susannah Grant,  Akiva Goldsman, and  Jeff Pinkner, the screenwriting team who adapted Yancey's book, have destroyed the book's rich texture.
  Very positive
Maybe it's unfair to judge a movie adaptation on the source material, but when problems arise in such situations, it's often a problem of adaptation.
  Negative
Even worse, it may make audiences think the book is as silly as the movie.
  Negative

How would I fare?"
  Neutral

Suzanne Collins' successful "Hunger Games" franchise has spawned a million imitators.
  Positive
If "Anne of Green Gables" were to be published today, the plucky red-headed orphan would have to crawl through an industrial wasteland to get any attention.
  Negative
Rick Yancey's trilogy the final installmentscheduled for May  is filled with haunting imagery of the earth left more than half-empty, but most chillingly, he understands tyranny and how it operates: if you can make confused frightened people line up and march towards the exits in an orderly fashion, you're halfway towards owning them completely.
  Negative
These important elements are sketched-in and undeveloped in the film.
  Positive
Instead, we're left with Cassie and Evan throwing longing looks at one another, confusing monologues where people figure out what the "th wave" is, and reunion scenes that have no punch.
  Negative
The closing narration is milquetoast cliche, something the Cassie in the book, with her raw tenderized heart, would never have tolerated.
  Negative
