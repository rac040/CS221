At the nasty center of the otherwise dutiful  Denial is a slimy, self-aggrandizing upper-class blowhard of a bigot who believes he has every right to circulate hateful and hurtful falsehoods to his followers including white supremacists and Neo-Nazis without suffering consequences or being called out for his actions.
  Negative
That might sound somewhat like dj vu to anyone who has been following the ongoing presidential campaign.
  Negative
But apparently the notion that a lie repeated often and loudly enough will somehow magically become a fact is not a new tactic.
  Negative
As despicable as the birther movement might be, the historical event that is being negated in this morally-charged legal procedural is a whopper way beyond the usual pale: That Adolf Hitler never ordered the extermination of six million European Jews during World War II.
  Negative
In other words, the Holocaust didnt exist.
  Negative
I doubt the filmmakers, including seasoned director  Mick Jackson whose varied resume includes s  The Bodyguard and s HBO biopic Temple Grandin and screenwriter  David Hare  The Hours knew that their timing would be so perfect eight years ago.
  Positive
Thats when they began adapting American academic and author Deborah E. Lipstadts first-hand account of the  libel lawsuit brought against her by British historian and Holocaust denier David Irving.
  Negative
But despite two terrifically nuanced performances by its male leads and a good try by its somewhat miscast female star, the simmering dramatics behind  Denial never quite reach a satisfying boil of righteous indignation and justice served that was felt in last years similar  Spotlight, the expose about the uncovering of the Catholic Churchs pedophile priest scandal.
  Negative
The film opens with the first public encounter between Lipstadt  Rachel Weisz, exuding intense intelligence yet too soon turned into a bystander and Irving  Timothy Spall, greedily soaking up the attention and grandly oozing smug know-it-all-ness from every pore.
  Negative
The bluntly outspoken Queens native is appearing at a speaking engagement at Emory University in Atlanta, where she teaches Jewish studies, for her new book on Holocaust deniers.
  Negative
A scheming Irving, along with several video-shooting cohorts, crashes her lecture and tries to engage her in a debate.
  Negative
When she refuses to indulge him, Irving grabs center stage by offering , money in hand to anyone who can show that Nazis killed Jews by gassing them at Auschwitz.
  Negative
Soon after, Lipstadt learns that Irving is suing her and publisher Penguin for libel after labeling him a Holocaust denier in her work.
  Negative
That leads to a trial held in England, where unlike the States defendants are guilty until proven innocent.
  Neutral
The burden of proof is on the good guys, which essentially means that the author and her legal team must somehow provide evidence that the Holocaust really occurred no easy task since the Nazis made sure to destroy signs of their horrific genocide.
  Negative
The story is primarily told from Lipstadts Yankee fish-out-of-water point of view underlined by her heavy accent and rust-hued perm a choice that ultimately keeps the audience at bay as well.
  Positive
Rather than having a single defense lawyer, the British legal system with its wigs and robes requires a solicitor  Andrew Scott, best known as Moriarty on TVs Sherlock, as a defamation expert who once represented Princess Diana in her divorce and is tasked with coming up with the strategy and a barrister  Tom Wilkinson, who singlehandedly elevates the third act with a towering display of human resolve, dedication and decency as a libel expert who presents the argument in court.
  Very negative
But other specifics about the case cause Lipstadt even more consternation.
  Negative
She wont be testifying even though Irving is acting as his own representative in court, no living Holocaust survivors will be called as witnesses to save them from being humiliated by Irving, we are told, but you have to believe they have withstood far worse and the lone decider of the verdict will be a judge instead of a jury.
  Very negative
While the lawsuit attracted rabid press coverage around the world, dont expect a depiction of the kinds of colorful behind-the-scenes shenanigans that drove TVs hugely popular The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story.
  Negative
Much like Lipstadt, viewers arent privy to the inner workings of the defense except in dribs and drabs.
  Negative
True, Irving comes up with a sort of catchy slogan akin to O.J. lawyer Johnny Cochrans most memorable phrase, If the glove dont fit, you must acquit.
  Negative
In this case, its No holes, no Holocaust referring to the supposed lack of rooftop openings for the Nazis to drop poison pellets into gas chambers at concentration camps.
  Negative
The sight of reporters rushing out to call in the headline-ready refrain is meant to have us think that all might be lost.
  Negative
But if that were the case, there would be no reason for this film to exist.
  Negative
What we do get instead is the rare location shoot in a non-documentary film at the actual Auschwitz.
  Positive
If Jackson does anything right, it is his solemn treatment of the visit made by Lipstadt and her lawyers to the site.
  Negative
First seen in the pre-dawn darkness with a blanket of snow and eerie pockets of fog, it is one of the few times that  Denial vividly drives home what is at stake in this lawsuit.
  Positive
Add to that the footage of mountainous piles of shoes and eyeglasses encased behind glass as part of an exhibit, and it is difficult not to be at least partly invested in the movies outcome.
  Negative
These scenes, and the look of utter repulsion that washes over Wilkinsons face as he refuses to make eye contact with Spalls Irving while delivering his final verbal coup detat, are the saving grace of a film that too often denies its audience a chance to feel the same.
  Negative
