Bollywood musical "Munna Michael" is too many movies crammed into one.
  Negative
Thisformulaic but satisfyingcrowd-pleasershifts its focus from one protagonist to another so many timesthat it's hard to tell whose story and emotions matter most.It only begins as a " Saturday Night Fever"-style celebration of lead protagonist Munna Michael  Tiger Shroff, a talented,self-absorbed dancer who hustles less-talented dancers by betting that he can out-dance them.
  Negative
The kicker is that all of Munna Michael's dance moves and some of the film's song lyrics are inspired by  Michael Jackson.
  Positive
Butsoon enough,Munna Michael gets banned from local Mumbai dance clubs, and moves to NewDelhi.While there, Munna Michael'sstory turns into a lumpy action-comedy:he tries to teach gangster Mahindar  Nawazuddin Siddiqui how to dance.
  Negative
But Mahindar only wants to dance so he can impress night-club dancer Dolly  Nidhhi Agerwal, who immediately becomes the object of Munna Michael's affection.
  Negative
He then tries to helpt Dolly realize her dream ofwinning the top prize on "Dancing Star,"a"So You Think You Can Dance"-style competition show.
  Negative
Which brings us back to Munna Michael, a character who hides his dancing career from his sick father  Anupam Shyam, a former Jackson-inspireddancer.
  Neutral
At this point, Munna Michael stops being the lead of his own film, and starts looking like a cliche-dispensing Swiss army knife.
  Negative
How many masters can one man serve?He's proud, and independent, like his idol, so his inability to dance out in the open automatically hobbles the film's plot.
  Neutral
Munna Michael'salso a foil for Mahindar, and his earnest quest to win Dolly's affection, which is sometimes annoying since Mahindar is simultaneously depicted as a clueless nebbish, and a raging brute.
  Negative
And then there's Dolly's story, a largelyuninspired"putting on a show"-style musical that only comes alive whenMunna Michael and hiscrew of back-up dancers hit the dance floor.
  Negative
Thankfully, the film'sset pieces are a treat.
  Positive
At this point, "Munna Michael" stops being held back by inconsistent characterizations, and cuts loose with derivative but viscerally satisfying musical numbers.
  Positive
Munna Michael's style is a mix of break-dancing spins and jumpsand Jackson-style joint-bending, limb-twirling, gravity-defying showmanship.When Munna Michael hits the dance-floor, viewers can enjoy Shroff do his thing thanks to the use of wide-angle lenses, lavish sets, and talented back-up dancers.
  Positive
These are moments where logic, as we know it, stops being important, and back-up dancers materialize out of nowhere.
  Negative
Not even a bullet can stop Munna Michael: he leaps,jumps,and pirouettes his way around in an infectiously joyous way.
  Positive
You've probably seen dancers that are at least this good before on "So You Think You Can Dance," and Shroff is admittedly not the most charismaticBollywood leading man.
  Neutral
But Shroff does well within the limited range of his character's "Tony Manero:show-stopper" style.
  Neutral
Shroff is also good enough to make slow-motion-intensive action scenes work.
  Positive
These scenes are not the most well-choreographed fight sequences you're likely to see.
  Negative
In fact, they're just a touchover-edited, and feature too many scenes that emphasize the blunt impact offlying into bicycle kicks andor windshields, concrete roads, glass windows,what have you.
  Negative
That having been said,there are several moments of cocky joy during these scenes, like when Shroff glides across the hood of an off-road vehicle in order to emphasize the car's brand.
  Negative
It's such a brazen move pulled off with such winning dickish-ness that I almost stood up and cheered.
  Positive
Moments like these are the real reason to see "Munna Michael," a collage of superior films' better ideas that works best when its characters are flexing their muscles, and acting like they're as talented as they are boastful.
  Positive
Unfortunately, only Shroff gets to look really good.
  Negative
Mahindar is embarrassed repeatedly whenever he tries to dance: his childish dance movesprove whatMunna Michael tells his competitors early on in the film: some people just can't dance very well.
  Negative
That hint of elitismis fascinating, but not particularly well-developed.
  Positive
If anything, that mentality is underwhelmed byAderwal's firstsolo dance number, the one that's supposed to catch Munna Michael's eye, and win him over.
  Negative
It's also evident in the scene where Munna Michael and Dolly serenade each other ... in the middle of the desert?
  Neutral
This probablyseems more out there than it actually is since there'san unwritten rule that requiresmost contemporary Bollywood films to includeat least one desertancient ruins-set slow danceserenade.
  Negative
Still, in this specific case, the scene undermines thesuggestion that some people are just born to dance while others can train constantly without ever becoming great.
  Negative
"Munna Michael" is not always great.
  Negative
It constantly fluctuates from being the kind of film I want to like to a giddy popcorn flick that doesn't know its own strengths.
  Negative
Still, "Munna Michael" has enough high points to make it the kind of film I'm glad I saw ona big screen.
  Positive
It's noisy, silly, and sometimes rather fun.
  Negative
I just wish it weren't such a hotmess.
