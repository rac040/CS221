If someone asked me about America as I understood it, Id play them Interpols Turn on the Bright Lights and tell them this made the world just a tiny bit straighter for me after , and scored my first relationship.
  Negative
Id tell them my great grandmother ran away from her impending marriage and joined the circus.
  Neutral
Id relate the story of my heroes Andrew Sarris and Molly Haskell, and how gorgeous Id always found it that two kindred spirits found each other despite their apparent differences.
  Very positive
Id tell them that our country was where studio filmmaking was perfected, and that Im sometimes a little worried that its rewards keep people placated while the rich get richer and gun violence runs rampant.
  Negative
Emmett Till,  Elaine May, the Rosenbergs, Stanley Kauffmann, Michael Brown, Warren Zevon,  Charles Burnett and Eugene McCarthy.
  Very negative
The good and the bad.
  Negative
Thats the America I know.
  Neutral
Everyone has a different version of the land they live in, and they only know so much, but that little bit contains multitudes.
  Negative
That is the impetus behind  Miguel Gomes latest film "Arabian Nights"  or, maybe series of films is a more apt description.
  Negative
Its a six-hour movie with a tonal and thematic through-line split into three two-hour sections.
  Negative
His wish is to tell the world about the Portugal he knows and the many, many pieces that make it whole.
  Positive
It begs pronouncement, first and foremost, that "Arabian Nights" should be watched all at once.
  Positive
Its parts, though cheerfully beguiling on their own, sing a more coherent song when watched end to end.
  Positive
They conclude powerfully after six hours.
  Negative
Thats not to say you should wait if you dont want to.
  Negative
Theyre delightful experiences, breezily stylish and full of life, but theres a reason Gomes felt the need to make as much of this film as he did.
  Positive
Theres a lot of Portugal, much of it being driven into poorly kept history books by the current government, and he wanted to pay tribute to all of it.
  Negative
"Volume , The Restless One," as hes subtitled it, is most overtly about the Portuguese governments version of trickle-down economics and the way it crushes hope among the working class.
  Positive
We open on a shipyard, the subject of a labor strike.
  Neutral
Gomes observes the sad, damp workplace setting unused while on the soundtrack we hear the stories of men who used to animate the big cranes.
  Negative
The giant machines slumber as every worker tells us what it meant to have a job, to keep the country humming.
  Negative
Then slowly the accounts turn dark.
  Neutral
Broken bones and chipped teeth from strike breakers start appearing.
  Negative
We see a lonely news crew covering the incident, one gathers, days after the worst of the violence has subsided.
  Negative
Thats why Gomes is here, physically, spiritually and morally.
  Positive
To make sure that this story will be covered in more depth than a single news crew can manage.
  Neutral
Thats why "Arabian Nights" is six hours long.
  Negative
That strike is one piece of a jigsaw puzzle that, once completed, depicts misery, violence, avarice and confusion, but also hope, freedom and solidarity.
  Negative
Gomes and his crew come next, filming themselves in preparation for their undertaking making the movie were watching.
  Neutral
The camera finds Gomes sitting alone on a bench surrounded by his crew.
  Neutral
After getting a sickly look on his face, he shiftily excuses himself from his seat and runs away from his crew.
  Negative
Impotence, he calls it, in voice-over.
  Positive
Terror at not knowing how to continue with the film.
  Neutral
Im stupid and abstraction gives me vertigo, he offers as the reason why he cant link the strike at the shipyard to something else that interests him, a plague of hornets decimating the local bee population.
  Very negative
Then he tells both stories simultaneously and the link presents itself, as if by magic.
  Positive
Not so abstract any longer.
  Neutral
Gomes begs that the viewer remember the confidence he instills in this flourish as he weaves the complex tapestry that is his Portugal.
  Positive
He has many vignettes, many tangents, many fables, parables and modernized myths in store, and if you remember how neatly he can tie together bees and striking laborers, youll never forget that all of this vertigo-inducing abstraction will become a strong whole.
  Negative
Gomes informs us that the stories that follow are told by Scheherazade, the fabled princess, who gave herself a stay of execution by telling her murderous husband fairy tales for , nights.
  Negative
Every night she takes a speed boat to an island of women who tell her new stories to bring back to her husband, the grand vizier, to distract him from killing her.
  Negative
Scheherazade is played by  Crista Alfaiate, who smiles as her director describes her beauty, is announced by the sweet sounds of Perfidia, and, above all, she is Portugal, the one Gomes and his heroes wish to preserve.
  Positive
She tells three stories in "The Restless One."
  Positive
One is about a group of bankers who wish for unyielding erections and, of course, get more than they bargained for.
  Negative
One is about a rooster who wont stop yodeling at inconvenient times.
  Neutral
It turns out he has a story of his own to tell, about a pre-adolescent love triangle.
  Positive
Finally, we check in with a trade unionist whose stomach rebels against him as he tries to collect the tales of three recently unemployed men.
  Neutral
This is the final section of part one and it plays kind of like an episode of "Parks and Recreation" written by  Franz Kafka and directed by Aki Kaurismki.
  Positive
Each of these stories slowly unfurls its metaphoric underpinning and meaning in modern Portuguese politics just in time for the next fable to begin.
  Negative
Part one of "Arabian Nights" has many wild components and even though they adhere to their own set of aesthetic principals, they make for a strange two-hour movie which is why its best to watch it with parts two and three.
  Positive
And yet this buffet of colorful characters and gently surreal symbols all bear the unmistakable stamp of Gomes, the restless one.
  Positive
His retelling of Portugals identity crisis is glued together with his wry sense of humor, cinephilia and knowledge of the seductive allure of all things untouched.
  Very positive
He wants us to know that even though his land is corrupted, mercilessly set upon by politicians and ruthless police forces, there is glory left in the land and people, and, occasionally, justice finds them.
  Negative
By treating modern crusaders as part of a cycle of myths, he makes their struggle heroic and worthy of being told again and again like the legends he draws inspiration from.
  Positive
Nebbish union organizers take the place of swashbuckling heroes, even though doubts and pains gnaw at their insides.
  Negative
Theyre fighting, in their own way, to maintain the health of a nation.
  Positive
Gomes, the director, is doing all he can to help by chronicling a dozen different melancholy episodes in the fight for a better tomorrow.
  Negative
The Portugal that Gomes wants the world to see is a prisoner, but it has so many stories to tell, it could never remain in bondage.
  Negative
