  Neutral
They are not monuments.

They were built for utilitarian purposes: banks, offices, a church, a library, a hospital.
  Negative
These geometric Modernist buildings pepper the landscape of the "Midwest Mecca of Architecture," Columbus, Indiana, and were designed by some of the most innovative architects of the th century: it's no wonder people travel there from all over to take architecture tours.
  Negative
Columbus' architecture is the canvas for "Columbus," the stunning directorial debut of Kogonada mainly known up until now as a video essayist, whose  Vimeo pageis a great archive of visual analysis.
  Positive
What Kogonada has done with "Columbus" along with cinematographer  Elisha Christian is to blend the background into the foreground and vice versa, so that you see things through the eyes of the two architecture-obsessed main characters.

Watching the film is almost like feeling the muscles in your eyes shift, as you look up from reading a book to stare out at the ocean.

  Negative
They are a part of the lives unfolding in their shadows.
  Neutral
Sometimes it almost seems like they are listening.
  Neutral
There is a story in "Columbus."
  Neutral
What is remarkable is how intense it is, given the stillness and quiet of Kogonada's style, and the focus with which he films the buildings.
  Very positive
A Korean-born man named Jin  John Cho travels to Columbus to care for his father, who is in the hospital following a catastrophic collapse.

  Neutral
He can't connect with the worry and sadness his friend is feeling.

On a separate track initially, we meet Casey  Haley Lu Richardson, working as a page at the Cleo Rogers Memorial Library one of the most important interiors in the film.
  Neutral

"Meth is really big here," says Casey.
  Negative
"Meth and Modernism."
  Neutral

  Neutral
Casey and a coworker  Rory Culkin have interesting discussions, sitting amidst the towering stacks, their conversations a blend of tentative flirting, kindness, and gentle debate.
  Positive
One day, Jin bums a cigarette from Casey.
  Negative
They strike up a conversation.
  Neutral
Over the course of "Columbus," Casey, obsessed with architecture, takes Jin around, showing him her favorite buildings she has a list.
  Negative
Jin is significantly older than Casey, but he treats her as a peer.
  Negative
There is instantly an intimacy between them, perhaps because both are so exhausted by their life circumstances.
  Positive
Their dynamic is fascinating.
  Very positive
There's an irritable quality to some of it, as though neither one of them wants to let the other "get away with" just skating off the surface of things.
  Negative
When Casey rattles off facts about the famous glass bank designed by Eero Saarinen, Jin gets bored.
  Negative
He pushes her to go deeper: what does the building make you feel?

There were only a couple of moments when the script was a little on the nose.
  Negative
But even in those moments the characters were wandering through such interesting spaces that there was always plenty to look at.
  Negative
Kogonada places their human figures against striking man-made backdrops with extreme care.
  Positive
He chooses his angles meticulously.
  Neutral
There isn't an uninteresting shot in the whole thing.
  Negative
Shots repeat.
  Neutral
Alleyways, sculptures, doorways, glass walls, the clocktower with the asymmetrical clockface, the church with the asymmetrical cross ... we go back to them again and again, Kogonada giving us time to contemplate them, to sink into them.
  Very positive
There's so much sadness in the film, it seeps into the air.
  Positive
Kogonada allows space for it, interspersing the conversations between Jin and Casey, or Casey and her mother, with long still shots of the library's striking ceiling, of the glass bank gleaming at night, the glass walkway hovering over a river, of the two brick monoliths floating in the air, almost, but not quite, touching.
  Positive
It's a profound approach.
  Positive
The depth of emotion the film stirred up surprised me.
  Positive
I got so involved in these two people's lives.
  Positive
I cared about them.
  Neutral
I liked eavesdropping on their conversations.
  Positive
When I first moved to New York, every time I caught a glimpse of the Chrysler Building's whimsical jewel-like crown, my breath would catch in my throat.
  Positive
Eventually, over time, I got used to it as part of my everyday world.
  Negative
But there are moments, usually at dusk, when suddenly it's like I see it for the first time, and I stare upward, taking a moment to appreciate that architect William Van Alen thought that building up, that he saw something that beautiful in his mind, and that he knew what it would add to the skyline: something so tall, and yet also so delicate.
  Positive
I try to remind myself: Make sure to look at the Chrysler Building on occasion.
  Negative
Make sure to appreciate it.
  Neutral
"Columbus" is a movie about the experience of looking, the interior space that opens up when you devote yourself to looking at something, receptive to the messages it might have for you.
  Negative
Movies the best ones anyway are the same way.
  Neutral
Looking at something in a concentrated way requires a mind-shift.
  Negative
Sometimes it takes time for the work to even reach you, since there's so much mental ballast in the way.
