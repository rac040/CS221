What do you get when you cross Sir  Elton John with a saber-toothed tiger?
  Neutral
I dont know, but you better keep it away from your ass!
  Positive
This is not exactly a joke, but its delivered as one by The Comedian, the struggling stand-up comic at the heart of Rick Alversons ironically named feature Entertainment.
  Negative
And the line gets the faintest hint of a laugh possibly because hes delivering it to a literally captive audience in a prison cafeteria, where the men in orange jumpsuits may be primed to chuckle at anything that deflates the tension around forced anal intercourse.
  Positive
Its one of the few moments in Entertainment where The Comedians awkward, confrontational one-liners actually amuse someone.
  Positive
Mostly, his onscreen audiences seem uncomfortable, embarrassed, and trending toward hostile, and the films viewers are primed to follow suit.
  Negative
Pushing the envelope of awkwardness to provoke an emotional reaction is unquestionably part of the point.
  Positive
But that commitment to terrible humor is one of the few unquestionable things about Entertainment, which is openly designed to provoke unease and uncertainty.
  Negative
The Comedian is played by real-life comedian Gregg Turkington, and hes essentially Turkingtons longtime alter-ego Neil Hamburger, right down to the owlish oversized glasses, ghastly comb-over, and habit of clutching three or four cocktails under one arm as he performs.
  Positive
Entertainment is a slice of life featuring him out on tour in the California wasteland around the Mojave Desert, hitting a series of mostly empty small-town bars and less reputable venues.
  Neutral
The other half of the act is a clown named Eddie " Mud" and " Joe" co-star  Tye Sheridan whose set largely consists of jumping around wearing a daffy grin, or simulating masturbation and defecation into his hat.
  Negative
Theyre an awkward pair, but at least Eddie seems like hes consciously putting on an act as brightly fake as the greasepaint he slathers onto his face.
  Negative
The Comedian is just as dour, awkward, and bitter offstage as he is onstage.
  Negative
Entertainment feels like a low-budget  David Lynch film, full of surreal interludes and oppressive silences.
  Negative
The script, written by Alverson, Turkington, and Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!s  Tim Heidecker who starred in Alversons last feature, The Comedy, consists of splintered moments that dont link together, except symbolically: The Comedian drifts through daytime tours of an airline graveyard and a sun-baked Old West movie set.
  Positive
He witnesses a bloody birth in a womens bathroom.
  Negative
He spends time with a farmer cousin  John C. Reilly, confronts a desperate hustler  Michael Cera, and gets shut into a light booth by a chromatherapist  Lotte Verbeek Stripped to his boxers, hes dragged into an eerie nighttime game of Marco Polo with a group of drunken strangers seemingly ported in from  Wild at Heart.
  Negative
Theres no sense of linear time in his world, just an overriding sense of dissociation, displacement, and frustration.
  Negative
And inevitably, he vents that frustration onstage.
  Negative
His awful gags Why dont rapists eat at T.G.I. Fridays?
  Negative
Well, its hard to go out and rape when you have a stomachache!
  Negative
are meant to be startling and off-putting, but his invective when his audience doesnt laugh or worse, talks back crosses the line into grotesquerie.
  Negative
Turkingtons whining, stammering delivery as Hamburger is designed to keep pushing audiences away: He draws out words until they turn into aural sandpaper.
  Positive
He repeats himself, stammers, or injects pauses so long that a faster-moving comic might be able to wedge a few bits in during the dead air.
  Negative
Hes excruciating.
  Negative
But The Comedian also seems authentically outraged at all the ingrates who dont find him hilarious.
  Negative
Or does he?
  Neutral
Thats the open question of a project this steeped in audience provocation.
  Negative
Turkington-as-Hamburger has been a known quantity for decades in terms of awkward, artificial discomfort comedy, and Heidecker projects like Tim and Eric and Check It Out!
  Negative
With Dr. Steve Brule starring Reilly go to the same well of comedy so consciously disjointed and confrontational that its meant to startle viewers back around into hilarity.
  Negative
Its hard to take anything The Comedian does entirely seriously, even when hes leaving weary, plaintive phone messages for a daughter who may not exist.
  Negative
His messages into the ether recall Dale Cooper endlessly talking into a tape recorder on Twin Peaks, just as Entertainments soundtrack, heavy on crooning, cooing dream-pop, recalls Lynchs work with Julee Cruise.
  Negative
But above all, Entertainment evokes Lynch by keeping the audience off-base, never entirely sure whats real.
  Positive
Lynch isnt Alversons only touchstone' Entertainment also recalls  Quentin Dupieuxs films Rubber and  Wrong, not just for the surreal, straight-faced confrontational comedy, but for the exquisitely shot sense of setting.
  Negative
Entertainment's" place in time and in the comedy world is unclear, but DP  Lorenzo Hagerman gives its arid desert locales and grimy venues a sense of solidity that helps ground the storys aimlessness.
  Negative
The Comedian is an ugly man with an ugly soul, and an ugly sense of comedy that at one point literally includes making fart noises for  full seconds as he pretends to gun down his silent audience with a soccer trophy.
  Very negative
But hes occupying a world that at times is strikingly beautiful.
  Positive
No wonder he resents it so much.
  Negative
