In its brief, -minute running time, Look amp' See: A Portrait of  Wendell Berry encompasses two different films, and neither one of them is, in fact, a portrait of the poetnovelistfarmeractivist Wendell Berry.
  Negative
Neither one of them, despite sincere intentions, is very good.
  Positive
One film is a tribute to Berry, with archival footage, interviews with his family, and poems read aloud over screensaver-pretty pictures of rural images, accompanied by a plinky piano or solo violin.
  Very positive
There are many sun flares, we assume, in part attributable to co-producer and sun flare-lover  Terrence Malick.
  Negative
We know where this is going from the sight and sound of an analog typewriter, keys smacking a fading ribbon to press letters imperfectly into paper.
  Negative
The film argues that technology, big corporations, and pretty much modernity itself are whats wrong with the world.
  Negative
The other film, intermingled with the first, is a documentary on these issues, interviewing farmers about their love for farming one says, Id rather make one dollar farming than ten dollars fencing, the challenges they face one says he cannot bring himself to admit how much he owes, and, in one case, a farmer talks about deciding to go organic.
  Negative
There is a jarring contrast between the poetic images of the Berry portion of the film, featuring the black and white photos of his longtime friend and collaborator  James Baker Hall and the stark, un-posed footage of contemporary farmers talking.
  Very positive
The Berry sections are glowing and cinematic.
  Positive
The farmer sections are brightly lit and thin, like nofilters on Instagram, which sharply undercuts the movies advocacy of farming as essentially connected to our foundational values.
  Negative
So do the images presented without comment of the planting and gathering of a particular crop: tobacco, and the brief appearance of migrant workers from Mexico with no acknowledgement that either might not be consistent with some values.
  Negative
Berry opposes what many people would term progress, the family farm giving way to agribusiness, the work of hands giving way to the work of machines.
  Neutral
There are a lot of valid arguments to make on this subject.
  Positive
Most of them are not in this movie.
  Negative
Instead, we get vague and unsupported platitudes about how industrialization, mechanization, and chemicals are bad and thrift, stewardship, private property, family, letterpress printing, woodworking, and dandelions are good.
  Neutral
The world is also full of people whod rather pay someone to kill the dandelions than appreciate the dandelions, Berry tells us.
  Positive
Im a dandelion man myself.
  Neutral
Yet he praises a farmer who keeps the weeds out of his crops for the same reason he washes his face.
  Neutral
Berry calls some of the terminology used by agribusiness and economists, the way people speak when they dont want to be understood by most people, and he says that he wants to introduce culture into the discussion of agriculture.
  Negative
He compares the use of market forces in the US to the use of military forces by communist countries, arguing that both are equally damaging.
  Negative
But he never explains how a return to family farms will be able to meet the nutritional and economic needs of  million Americans and the populations fed overseas by US exports or why farmworkers should forego access to technology that reduces risk and increases productivity.
  Negative
Handing down a family farm to the next generation can keep the focus on long-term sustainability, but Berry never acknowledges that the next generation might want to exercise the same right that he did in leaving the big city to come to the farm to make the trip in the other direction.
  Negative
Its hardship is its possibility, Berry cheerily assures us.
  Positive
Jargon can be used to obfuscate, but so can poetry.
  Positive
