You know what they say: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
  Negative
The blog A Gay Girl in Damascus, which rose to international fame in  before it was revealed as a hoax, was always too good to be true, from the start.
  Negative
It was supposedly written by Amina Arraf, a U.S. citizen living in Syria.
  Negative
She was a lesbian, out to her parents, and provided street-level perspective on the Syrian uprising.
  Negative
The combination of Middle Eastern politics, gender, and sexuality proved irresistible, perfect bait for a media hungry for human interest stories as though the fact that the Syrian people were being bludgeoned in the streets was not human enough.
  Neutral
A group of far-flung journalists namely, Andy Carvin from NPR, and the guys from Electronic Intifada, as well as real Syrian activists, plus the U.S. State Department sent on a wild goose-chase for Amina when she was allegedly kidnapped by the Assad regime, brought the hoax to light with a couple of simple fact-checks that should have been done at the get-go.
  Very negative
Amina did not exist.
  Negative
The gay girl blog was actually written by Tom MacMasters, a white middle-aged guy from Georgia the U.S. state.
  Negative
A Gay Girl in Damascus: The Amina Profile, directed by  Sophie Deraspe, is a compelling and insightful examination of this strange story, and it utilizes the cooperation of Sandra Bagaria, the Canadian woman who had been in a long-distance romantic relationship with Amina even though the two had never met.
  Positive
Bagaria tells her own story, but also conducts the various interviews with those who intersected with the fictional Amina.
  Positive
The reality of Sandra, that she was clearly a real woman who existed, was part of the reason the hoax was believed so wholeheartedly.
  Negative
Unlike  Catfish, which felt like little more than an amateurish directorial stunt, The Amina Profile digs into the implications of such a hoax, both emotional and in this case political.
  Negative
The film works in a dreamlike fashion, opening with erotic texts between Amina and Sandra, all as two women in silhouette disrobe slowly, facing one another.
  Positive
Deraspe takes a non-literal approach to the material and it works beautifully, since this is, after all, a story about a collective belief in a fantasy.
  Positive
There are plenty of talking-heads, but the interviews are interspersed with a collage of images, pulling us into the fictional world MacMasters set up.
  Positive
One of the images repeats: A girl walks through the narrow streets and alleys of Damascus, the camera following her, her face never shown.
  Negative
She is a cipher, a faceless figure.
  Positive
She is courageous, she is frightened, she is eager, she is hopeful.
  Very positive
She is whatever we want her to be.
  Neutral
The visual choices Deraspe makes are effective because one of the experiences of a hoax such as this is that people are drawn into the fiction, as though into a dream.
  Positive
The girl figure walking away from us, is Lewis Carrolls white rabbit, beckoning Alice further and further into the dreamworld.
  Negative
Who was Tom MacMasters?
  Neutral
Why would someone do this?
  Negative
What need was he expressing?
  Neutral
The time-commitment alone required for such a hoax is immense.
  Negative
Does he have remorse?
  Neutral
Does he understand what he has done?
  Neutral
Is he still out there, creating another online persona?
  Neutral
"The Amina Profile" is interested in every level of this complex emotionally-fraught story.
  Positive
This is not just the story of the catfishing of Sandra Bagaria.
  Negative
Everyone was catfished.
  Negative
The moment human beings had the ability to interact purely remotely, the desire of some to create fake online personalities complete, usually, with traumadiseaseconstant high drama proved irresistible.
  Positive
There are too many examples to list, and, except for the emotional havoc wreaked on those who believed they were interacting with a real person, the results are relatively localized.
  Negative
Throngs of people were taken in by the tragic adventures of Kaycee Nicole, a young girl with leukemia, before it was revealed that the entire thing was a fiction.
  Negative
Notre Dame linebacker Manti Teo, more recently, became a media darling because he was devoted to a dying girlfriend, who turned out to be a hoax.
  Negative
Munchausen by Internet is a phenomenon with a million horrible stories attached to it.
  Negative
The cautionary tales proliferate.
  Neutral
Dont believe everything you read on the Internet.
  Neutral
People are not who they say they are.
  Neutral
These stories are also a critique of our feel-good culture, our love of stories that are "uplifting."
  Positive
We all become dupes in such an unthinking environment.
  Negative
A Gay Girl in Damascus was similar to these, but different in its scope.
  Neutral
While the media was eagerly covering the Gay Girl, real stories of real people in Syria were not being covered.
  Negative
The Gay Girl hoax was used by the Assad regime to discredit the real activists in brutal ways.
  Negative
It was not a victimless hoax.
  Negative
Rami Nakhla, a Syrian activist, tears up at one point, talking about a friend of his from Syria, also gay, also imprisoned, but no one was talking about her at all.The Amina Profile questions the appeal of human interest stories, especially when they take precedence over real news.
  Positive
Because isnt any story a human story, since it involves human beings?
  Positive
Why did it take a fictional gay girl in Damascus to get people interested?
  Negative
One of the byproducts of The Amina Profile is that it celebrates those who maintain their critical thinking skills, who refuse to get swept away by a heartwarming narrative.
  Positive
Nobody thanks those people in the moment.
  Positive
On the contrary, they are met with outrage and hurt.
  Negative
How dare you question this wonderful story that makes us all feel good about ourselves?
  Positive
In response to Tom MacMasters statement that along with practicing his conversational writing skills he wanted to give voice to the real people on the ground in Syria, one of the Syrians interviewed shot back sharply, We have voices.
  Negative
We can speak for ourselves, thank you very much.
  Positive
That's the real point.
  Positive
