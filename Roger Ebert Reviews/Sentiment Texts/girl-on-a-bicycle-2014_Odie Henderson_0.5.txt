Derek  Paddy Considine is an Englishman living in Paris.
  Neutral
He's spent years learning the language, and all his little heart desires is to find a French woman willing to speak French with him.
  Positive
Seems every French woman he encounters wants to speak English when they find it's his native tongue.
  Negative
He's been through three French wives, none of whom wanted to grant his linguistic wish.
  Negative
Model Cecile Laurent  Louise Monot speaks perfect French and doesn't mind being naked.
  Negative
She's the titular character of "Girl on a Bicycle."
  Neutral
Due to an accident she's a klutz she's nursing a broken arm and a broken leg.
  Negative
While testing out her new bicycle in her apartment, the stationary platform suddenly comes loose.
  Negative
Cecile goes flying out her window, broken limbs all akimbo.
  Negative
She hits the conveniently placed caf awning across the street, and lands in the arms of Derek, who just happens to be sitting there nursing a latte.
  Negative
Sounds like a respectable, dare I say clever, Meet Cute at the beginning of a romantic comedy, n'est-ce pas?
  Neutral
Unfortunately, this happens almost an hour into "Girl on a Bike."
  Negative
The movie isn't about this relationship.
  Negative
Derek is merely a secondary character the screenplay trots out whenever it gets stuck.
  Neutral
He hooks up with Cecile, but it's just a subplot.
  Positive
The real movie is happening elsewhere.
  Positive
The bicycle that sends Cecile airborne was given to her by Italian transplant Paolo  Vincenzo Amato, the main character of "Girl on a Bicycle."
  Negative
Cecile's broken bones are also courtesy of Paolo, who ran her over with his gigantic tour bus while trying to get her phone number.
  Negative
As a result, Paolo must take care of Cecile and her two children, who think Paolo is their father.
  Negative
Paolo uses Derek to hide this activity from German flight attendant Greta Nora Tschiriner, the fiance Paolo was going to cheat on had he successfully obtained Cecile's number.
  Negative
Got all that?
  Neutral
The word convoluted does no justice to just how poorly designed "Girl on a Bicycle" is.
  Negative
It is also stereotypical, unfunny, unromantic, absurd, sitcomish, insulting to several European ethnicities and a slave to what Roger Ebert used to call "The Idiot Plot Syndrome."
  Negative
It may be the worst romantic comedy I have ever seen, and this is not hyperbole.
  Very negative
Usually, I like to go into movies with as little knowledge of their content as possible.
  Negative
Had I done my homework, none of the characteristics of "Girl on a Bicycle" would have surprised me.
  Negative
It's written and directed by  Jeremy Leven, who wrote such cinematic cannon fodder as "Don Juan De Marco," " Alex and Emma," and "The Legend of Bagger Vance."
  Negative
You need a suspension of disbelief the size of Jupiter to buy what this guy's been selling, but even if you possess that admirable quality, it won't help you get through "Girl on a Bicycle."
  Negative
Each character is reduced to the most common stereotype of their country.
  Negative
German Greta is a meticulous control freak who rules her airplane with an iron fist.
  Positive
She's so controlling she directs Vincenzo's marriage proposal.
  Positive
Brit Derek is an agreeable bloke who likes to drink and is polite even when being yanked off Cecile during sex by Vincenzo.
  Negative
Italian Vincenzo is a snob who thinks Italy is better than any other country.
  Negative
He makes pasta and talks with his hands.
  Positive
There's also a horny French pilot with perpetual, Jean Reno-approved -o'clock shadow.
  Negative
When not trying to bang Greta, the pilot advises her on matters of l'amour.
  Negative
His descriptions of Italian men should inspire protests.
  Neutral
Vincenzo tells whoppers of lies, hurtful lies that the screenplay cleans up in the most uninspired, cheating ways possible.
  Negative
He lies to Cecile's kids, who apparently have never seen their father.
  Positive
Cecile is not only fine with this, she lets this strange man who ran her over, mind you take her kids to school and stay in her apartment.
  Negative
Vincenzo also lies to Greta, who thinks he's having an affair but is so slow to act upon her suspicions that she loses all credibility.
  Negative
When Vincenzo takes a phone call during sex Leven seems to think coitus interruptus is funny, then suddenly leaves, Greta's complaint isn't that he's leaving for points unknown at   AM , but that he didn't finish first.
  Negative
Really, Frau Thing?
  Negative
Every single romantic comedy clich is evident here!
  Positive
There are cute kids who repeat the same thing.
  Positive
"I am siiiiix," says one.
  Neutral
"I am fiiiive," says the other.
  Negative
There's the overbearing score, the constant misunderstandings, the mere notion that one explanation would clear up those misunderstandings, and the characters whose brains must be concussed because their actions make no sense.
  Negative
Lest I forget the numerous lines that quiver with Meaning:  "I am going to give you the secret of life, pal.
  Negative
There's always gonna be a girl on a bicycle."
  Neutral
"If love doesn't have the power to forgive, what kind of love is it?"
  Positive
The big romantic climax features Vincenzo barricaded in an airplane bathroom while all the inconvenienced fellow passengers sing an Italian song to win Greta back.
  Negative
I rolled my eyes, but then I remembered that a similar airplane sing-a-long worked in " The Wedding Singer."
  Negative
In fact, I could think of several other movies where plot elements employed in "Girl on a Bicycle" worked.
  Negative
But all those films had characters who made me care about their romances.
  Neutral
Almost anything can be forgiven if you have two people the audience wants to succeed in love.
  Neutral
There is nothing but failure here.
  Very negative
