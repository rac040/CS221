The result is a lively, often hilarious collection of talking heads that includes fans and actors from the original and current incarnations of Star Trek, plus footage of Leonard Nimoy in the numerous roles that were overshadowed by his most famous creation.
  Positive
Much of the film is narrated by Leonard Nimoy, who immediately jumped at the chance to work with Adam for the first time since their collaboration on the remake of an old Outer Limits episode  years prior.
  Negative
Nimoy plays the same role in both versions, which the film juxtaposes to show not only the passage of time but also the equal amount of commitment put into both performances.

But it was an appearance in a  episode of The Lieutenant that got Star Trek creator  Gene Roddenberrys attention.
  Positive
Hed make a good alien, Roddenberry said.
  Positive
It was a mild understatement, to be sure.
  Neutral
Trekkies can probably recite by heart many of the details this film provides about the show.
  Positive
When NBC considered Roddenberrys original pilot too cerebral, he created a new version featuring a different lead actor,  William Shatner.
  Negative
Had NBC completely gotten its way, Shatner would have been acting opposite a different alien' the network considered Spock too satanic looking and feared hed offend the Bible Belt viewers.
  Negative
Those same viewers may have contributed to the truckloads of fan mail, and carloads of fans, that came to the Nimoy household after the shows first few episodes.
  Negative
People were stealing leaves and grass from our front yard, Adam Nimoy recalls.
  Negative
And this wasbeforethe shows  cancellation and syndication deal created the type of cult status that made its first convention in  a rousing success.
  Positive
Though Shatners Kirk was the shows overly emotional lead, more people saw themselves in the mostly emotionless Spock.
  Negative
He predictably resonated with young science lovers in training like Neil deGrasse Tyson and NASA employees Bobak Ferdowksi and Amy Mainzer, whose interviews mention Spocks thirst for knowledge.
  Negative
But For the Love of Spock shows that Spock also appealed to anyone who felt like a societal odd man out.
  Negative
For example, Ferdowski points out that, as a biracial person, he felt a kinship with Spocks half-human, half-Vulcan identity and its accompanying trials and tribulations.

He was a better singer than I was, says Shatner.
  Negative
He could hold a note off-key, but he could hold it.
  Neutral
The younger Nimoy also cant help ribbing his Dads warbling: in a revised Star Trek scene he substitutes Leonards awesome, infamous music video for the Hobbit-loving ditty, The Ballad of Bilbo Baggins for whatever originally inspired the USS Enterprise crews horrified response.
  Negative
Scenes like this reflect the level of thoroughness For the Love of Spock has for Leonard Nimoys career.Fans of  Mission: Impossible and my personal favorite In Search Of are rewarded with clips from each show along with Nimoys own commentary about them.
  Negative
Nimoys directing career, which often goes forgotten nowadays, is also celebrated.
  Negative
Were reminded us that he not only directed the best film in Paramounts original Star Trek movie series  Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, but he also directed the series prior installment and the box office hit  Three Men and a Baby."
  Positive
Alas, theres no  Steve Guttenberg talking head interview in For the Love of Spock," which is bound to disappoint legions upon legions of viewers.
  Negative
But seriously, while For the Love of Spock is a very entertaining and light-hearted look at the man behind Spocks pointy ears, theres an underlying sadness that Adam Nimoy never lets us forget.The tensions between fathers and sons has always made for compelling drama, and the tale of Adam and Leonard includes alcohol and drug addiction and the aftereffects of fame depleting a fathers time with his children.
  Positive
Nimoy uses a powerful letter of explanation written by his father in  to great effect, reading it in fragments throughout the film as a dramatic counterpoint.
  Positive
The director also uses footage of a Viking funeral of sorts for Spock and by extension, his portrayer at s Burning Man as a haunting, cathartic visual elegy, closing the film on an effective moment of tribute.
  Positive
