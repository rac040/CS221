Nicolas Cage is often accused of taking parts that dont challenge his undeniable range, especially in recent years as the "paycheck parts" have piled up.
  Positive
His s output of films like Rage,  Outcast, Stolen,  The Frozen Ground and  Left Behind make this argument of creative coasting harder to dismiss and almost more painful considering Cage delivered one of his career-best turns in the middle of this garbage onslaught with  Joe.
  Negative
Looking over Cages resume, I considered the following phrase carefully: Pay the Ghost, out in very limited release today, is a new low for Nicolas Cage.
  Negative
Just when you thought he couldnt get any more apathetic about a role, he pops up in this lazy, boring retread of  Insidious that even his most diehard fans should ignore.
  Negative
Based on a novella by  Tim Lebbon, Pay the Ghost stars Cage as Mike Lawford, an English teacher who drops references to Lovecraft and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe just so you get the impression that Dan Kays screenplay comes with great literary aspirations.
  Negative
Spoiler: It does not.
  Negative
Lawford is married to Kristen Sarah Wayne Callies, and the two have a child named Charlie  Jack Fulton.
  Negative
Of course, Mike is a distant dad, not around enough as he tries to earn tenure at the university where he teaches.
  Negative
On Halloween, Lawford finally gets tenure, and comes home to celebrate with his family.
  Positive
He even convinces his wife to let him take Charlie to a late-night Halloween parade do those things really happen in NYC in ?
  Neutral
Charlie, who has been having odd visions of late, asks dad if they can pay the ghost, and abruptly disappears.
  Negative
A year later, Mike and Kristen have been torn apart by the disappearance of their son, and start to have supernatural visions, including hearing a child screaming and seeing Charlie on a bus.
  Negative
Is Charlie trying to communicate to them from the other side?
  Neutral
With a laughably small amount of research, Mike notices that while children who go missing are often found, those who disappear on All Hallows Eve rarely come home again.
  Negative
Someone, or something, is abducting kids on October  st , and many of the guardians of the abductees tell the same story of the titular phrase being said just before they disappeared.
  Negative
Who is the ghost that must be paid?
  Neutral
What must he or she be paid with?
  Neutral
Does this have something to do with Cages notorious IRS problems?
  Neutral
Its amazing how long Pay the Ghost drags itself through a feature-length running time with almost nothing to speak of in terms of plot.
  Negative
Charlie disappears, and dad looks for him.
  Positive
The set-up is a slog, as we know theres no movie without dad making contact with his son again, and theres absolutely no style or character to get us over the lack of narrative suspense.
  Negative
Cage doesnt even give it his wide-eyed all' hes more fun in Left Behind.
  Positive
Perhaps presuming that director  Uli Edel would actually dramatically ground Pay the Ghost in something relatable, Cage actually plays it straight, which eliminates any B-movie fun that could even be had with this misstep.
  Negative
If youre going to do a lackluster horror movie just for the money, at least try and have some fun with it.
  Neutral
Instead, Pay the Ghost does nothing that we havent seen done more entertainingly and incisively in other films.
  Negative
It literally has two characters at the -minute mark explain the entire narrative where Charlie is, how to save him, why he was taken, etc. in back-to-back conversations.
  Negative
It is the apex of lazy screenwriting.
  Negative
At one point, Lawford notes to his class that Washington Irving established the tone of his infamous piece " Sleepy Hollow" with just its name.
  Negative
So does Pay the Ghost.
  Neutral
Its to Pay the Bills.
  Neutral
