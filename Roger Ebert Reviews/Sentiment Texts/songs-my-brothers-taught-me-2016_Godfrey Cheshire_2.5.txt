The venerable editor-in-chief of this site, Matt Zoller Seitz, once suggested to me that there should be a cable channel called BLTV, short for Badlands Television, comprised of films derivative of  Terrence Malicks  Badlands.
  Very negative
Expanding that idea somewhat, I would argue that BLTV needs to be part of a much larger Malick Network, which would include not only beautiful-young-criminals-on-the-lam tales but also the many films by American indie directors influenced by Malicks poetic way with light, landscapes and impressionistic narratives focused on inward-looking characters theyre the ones whose pensive musings are usually conveyed in voice-over.
  Negative
Chloe Zhaos Songs My Brothers Taught Me would earn a prime spot on the Malick Network though not, ironically, on BLTV: though set in the Badlands of South Dakota, it doesnt concern lovers-on-the-lam.
  Negative
It also has another, somewhat overlapping pedigree.
  Positive
A product of the Sundance Labs and their dedication to fostering movies about Native American culture, it is an earnest, smartly mounted film about life on a present-day reservation.
  Very positive
If the Malick and Sundance influences combined lead you to expect a work thats stronger aesthetically and ethnographically than dramatically, then you wont be surprised by Songs My Brothers Taught Me.
  Negative
The character whose voice-overs begin and end the film, Johnny  John Reddy, is a handsome, muscular Lakota high school senior whos itching to leave the dreary confines of reservation life and move to Los Angeles.
  Negative
We first see him riding a horse and pensively musing on how its necessary to leave some of the wildness in such an animal, which needs that edge to survive.
  Negative
Thankfully, the metaphorical obviousness here doesnt continue, as Zhao quickly settles into a nuanced, unhurried look at the life Johnny wants to escape.
  Negative
The boys most crucial relationship is with his younger sister, Jashaun Jashaun St. John, who looks to him for the understanding and emotional support she doesnt find elsewhere.
  Negative
The two live with their erratic, troubled mom  Irene Bedard, who tries to urge the comfort she finds in religion on an older son whos in prison.
  Negative
Johnnys inclination to strike out in the wider world comes at a difficult emotional moment for his family.
  Negative
Not long after we meet them, he, sis and mom learn that the kids father, a rodeo cowboy who fathered  children by nine so-called wives, has burned to death in his home.
  Negative
This news not only shocks and saddens them, and introduces a soft note of mystery, it also suggests the precariousness of life on the Pine Ridge reservation.
  Negative
In a scene that typifies Zhaos anecdotal approach, we visit one of Johnnys high school classes, where a large snake is being passed around as the teacher asks his seniors what kind of work they hope to do after graduation.
  Negative
Theres not much dramatic purpose to this passage, but we do learn that animals loom large in their plans.
  Neutral
The most desired occupation seems to be bull rider.
  Negative
The narrative torque increases in parts of the story where the problems of alcohol abuse and violence intertwine.
  Negative
Theres a stark emphasis on the bane of alcoholism in several scenes, and Johnny earns money by running booze from across the Nebraska border to the reservation, an activity that earns him the enmity of a rival gang that isnt above beating the hell out of any competitor and torching his pick-up.
  Negative
Criminal activity and its perils aside, Johnny is effectively pulled in opposite directions throughout the story.
  Negative
His bright girlfriend Aurelia  Taysha Fuller wants him to go with her to L.A., where she plans to attend college.
  Negative
His ambitions for the city are far less well-developed, though, and meanwhile his attachment to Jashaun makes it hard for him to actually begin cutting the emotional ties hell need to cut if hes going to leave.
  Very negative
The film is good at conveying his attachment not only to his sibling but also to the Native American culture he grew up in.
  Positive
The storys ending, complete with lyrical voice-over, conveys the beauty and emotional attraction of the place and its traditions, virtues also relayed by Joshua James Richards sumptuous, sometimes breathtaking cinematography.
  Very positive
Other assets include the strong performances Zhao gets from her mostly non-professional cast, and  Peter Golubs spare, haunting score.
  Positive
