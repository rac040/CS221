At first she was known as The Girl of Your Dreams, and now she is The Queen of Spain.
  Positive
Those bombastic, marquee-ready titles are referring to characters played by the great  Penelope Cruz in a now-franchise by writerdirector  Fernando Trueba, who uses Cruz as a type of muse for comic lessons in Spanish film history.
  Negative
As an actress named Macarena Granada, Cruz leads an ensemble cast of people who are trying to make big budget films in different political periods.
  Positive
The Girl of Your Dreams, released in , had Macarena and her on-set collaborators dealing with Naziism, at a time when Spanish films were made in Germany.
  Negative
This sequel focuses on the creation of a Spanish-American film in , after America has started to make productions in Spain, using the country's talent and with the blessing of dictator Francisco Franco.
  Neutral
By this time, Macarena has become a Hollywood fixation, even starring opposite  Kirk Douglas in one seamlessly rendered fake scene, and has returned to Spain for a production about the Catholic Queen, Queen Isabella.
  Negative
She stars opposite a Hollywood fixture named  Gary Jones, played with blunt hamminess by  Cary Elwes.
  Neutral
The production is directed by famed American filmmaker  John Scott, who, as portrayed by  Clive Revill, is a direct goof on  John Ford, eyepatch and all.
  Negative
Mandy Patinkin appears as an American screenwriter who was blacklisted but able to make films in Spain.
  Negative
He takes over directing in fleeting gags about Scotts inability to stay awake, or sober, while slumped in the directors chair.
  Negative
There are other faces working on The Queen of Spain that come back from the first movie, like the actress Lucia Grandia  Neus Asensi, Macarenas assistant Trini Loses Leon or production designer Castillo  Santiago Segura.
  Negative
Aside from being reintroduced and then shown conversing at a crew lunch table, they are not up to much during the movie's two-hour running time.
  Negative
Instead, a significant amount of energy for this relatively chaotic production of Spains biggest movie yet comes from an assistant director played by  Javier Camara, who is new to Truebas party but a welcome addition.
  Neutral
Theres an initially interesting story with the return of main character Blas Frontiveros  Antonio Resines, a previous lover of Macarenas and the director of the film being made in The Girl of Your Dreams.
  Positive
He enters this story as a ghost, thought by everyone to be dead, emerging from the shadows after hearing about Macarena's new film.
  Negative
Frontiveros is soon kidnapped by the government and must be rescued, which makes for both null dramatic tension during his captivity despite being presented as in some type of danger or the rescue attempt that eventually happens.
  Negative
This thread shares the same milquetoast nature as one with Macarena repeatedly eyeballing a smoldering grip named Leo Chino Darin, only to start a type of affair that is, like much else in Truebas enterprise, hollow.
  Negative
The focal point for all of this is of course Cruz, who is very good in this movie, as she is in many films, a fact this project seems dedicated to.
  Very positive
Not only does she brandish a scientifically-confounding ability to resist aging in a way that no returning cast member can match, but the movie celebrates what creates her utterly luminous presence.
  Negative
And yet, the movie says nothing new about her that cant be found in other movies, whether its creating magnetic close-ups by simply appearing them, acting like a goofball as she does later in "The Queen of Spain," or being a talented actor first and foremost in this movie, Macarena studied under Strasberg.
  Negative
As a type of tribute to Cruz that collects her many skills into one movie, The Queen of Spain makes its tiny impression on movie history.
  Positive
But we dont need a film like this to tell us that shes acting royalty.
  Negative
As for everyone, this is a -year reunion that has the airiness of just another episode, as opposed to the immediacy and ultimate quality of a sequel.
  Negative
It doesnt feel like Trueba really knows what he wants to do with all of these characters, which makes its rare strong comedy more of a fluke: I was amused in particular, yet admittedly didnt laugh at, a running joke involving actor Julian constantly pinching his private parts in order to make himself cry on camera.
  Positive
But the script is more full of throwaway passages that bid for the cheapest of laughs, like when Elwes carries over the homophobia from The Girl of Your Dreams and becomes predatory on Julian, trying to manipulate the Spanish actor with the allure of Hollywood.
  Negative
The movie receives little comic energy to go with its touch-and-go dramatic intentions, creating a showbiz tale thats far slower than it should be.
  Negative
With its distinct historical context and low-key slap-happy tone spread across its massive cast, The Queen of Spain wants to be light while it presents shenanigans that occur on straight-from-the-history-books film sets.
  Positive
But the storytelling is rarely as inspired as the detail, in which flat scenarios takes place on lavishly re-created soundstages of which The Queen of Spain received a Best Art Direction Goya Award nomination, rightfully so.
  Negative
There is a pinch of movie magic in the story as it is dedicated to the rigorous process of making a film, so tasks like matte painting or even setting up tracks for camera shots finally get their close-up.
  Positive
But The Queen of Spain can only offer scant entertainment for movie buffs and non-movie buffs alike.
  Positive
