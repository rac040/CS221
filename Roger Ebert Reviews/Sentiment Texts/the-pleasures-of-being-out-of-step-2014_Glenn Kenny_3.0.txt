I am a privileged person in many ways, but one of the ways in that Im most privileged, I sometimes think, is that I got to lay eyes on Nat Hentoffs office at the Village Voice back when the legendary paper had its offices off Union Square in Manhattan.
  Negative
This was in the early s, at a point when Hentoff had produced enough work and wielded enough influence over thinkers, not politicians or real estate moguls to have made several careers and spanned several lifetimes.
  Negative
In other words, the one time jazz critic, music impresario, and ever-tireless gadfly in defense of the First Amendment was as legendary at the paper where he wrote a column and kept an office.
  Negative
That office: Id never seen anything like it before, and Ive never seen anything like it since.
  Negative
From floor to ceiling it held what can only be called pillars, stacked, if you can call it that, side by side by side by side, of newspapers and books.
  Negative
You couldnt see the light fixture at the top of the room.
  Positive
The only open space in the office was its small doorway, a few steps past which was a small desk with a typewriter and a lamp on it, and a chair in front of it.
  Negative
It was unbelievable, not just because it was a fire hazard, not just because it was the sort of scene that inspired a weird how do you find anything?
  Negative
awe.
  Positive
It was also a testament to Hentoffs attitude to the printed word.
  Neutral
He hoarded it.
  Positive
Crazy love, you can call it.
  Positive
Sometimes, during  David Lewis engaging documentary about Hentoff, The Pleasures of Being Out Of Step, when you look behind the now nearly-year-old Hentoff as he speaks from his home office he was laid off from the Voice in , putting arguably the final nail in the coffin of what that publication had once been, and stood for you can see a version of that mess in miniature, a stray stack or two.
  Negative
But I wish the doc had a picture of that office, man.
  Negative
It would qualify for some kind of special effects Oscar, I promise.
  Positive
Lewis subtitles his movie Notes on the Life of Nat Hentoff, and thats wise' at less than  minutes in length, theres only so much ground it can cover.
  Negative
The documentary takes a thematic rather than linear chronological approach.
  Negative
Lewis weaves together material on Hentoffs love of jazz and his shoe-leather training as a wordsmith, and tries to make a case that the freedom thats inherent in jazz as a musical form has something to say about the Constitution-guaranteed freedoms Hentoff has spent a good portion of his life articulating and defending.
  Positive
This First Amendment absolutist, an atheist and a Jew, achieved what some might consider a perverse notoriety when he defended the right of the American Nazi Party to stage a parade in Skokie, Illinois.
  Negative
Years later, Hentoff, whom many of his readers had taken for granted was a supporter of all liberal or liberal-related issues, made a lot of enemies by coming out with a stern position against abortion.
  Negative
One might not think that bouncing back and forth between Jazz Hentoff and First Amendment Hentoff would make for consistently engaging viewing, but the movie is in fact remarkably fluid and never less than compelling.
  Positive
Like many biographical documentaries, it features an array of talking heads, but I cant think of any such pictures featuring such an eclectic array of such figures: poet and rhetorical firebrand Amiri Baraka, constitutional lawyer  Floyd Abrams, jazz giant  Phil Woods, pioneering feminist journalist Karen Durbin, and many more, including Hentoffs second wife Margot, who seems in many ways as formidable a figure as her spouse.
  Negative
Full disclosure: while Ive never had the pleasure of meeting Hentoff, Karen Durbin is a friend, as is another interviewee here, former record executive Regina Joskow.
  Negative
The movie is also enlivened by a lot of fantastic archival footage, and again here the range is remarkable.
  Very positive
Not many films boost cameos from both William F. Buckley and Thelonious Monk.
  Negative
Despite his rep as Always itching for a fight, Hentoff here comes off as pretty mild mannered, and indeed his equanimity in speaking is cited by more than one interviewee as almost maddening.
  Negative
He articulates his point of view with great calm, reflecting on his betrayals of liberalism as nothing more than facets in a lifetime of argument.
  Positive
An argument in which he believes he holds the correct opinion, of course, but an argument nonetheless.
  Neutral
Past accusations of homophobia and anti-feminism roll off of him like water off a ducks back, but, as a viewer, I was disappointed that he didnt address them more directly, and also that Hentoff doesnt reflect at all on the sundered friendships so many arguments have left in their wake.
  Very negative
Dont get yourself caught up in categories, Hentoff recalls being told by  Duke Ellington.
  Negative
Hentoff followed this advice while sticking like a barnacle to some very key principles.
  Negative
Even if you disagree with him, the man who emerges in this portrait is both an invaluable advocate of the arts and a moral hero.
  Positive
And he also wrote the liner notes to Sketches of Spain.
  Negative
