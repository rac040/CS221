No good can ultimately come from a movie that is as obsessed with wind chimes as Cake.
  Negative
That constant tinkle-tinkle should be a warning that what starts off as a medical drama with a healthy nasty streak wont be able to resist slapping a bandage on all the badness in the end.
  Negative
But it is worth sitting through just to watch  Jennifer Aniston pull off a performance of a lifetime.
  Negative
The funny lady has gone dramatic before to fine effect in such indie outings as s  The Good Girl and s  Friends With Money.
  Positive
But not like this.
  Neutral
You wont be able to take her eyes off of her, which is a good thing since it will take a while to notice that the film surrounding her starts to go soft around the edges until it collapses all together.
  Neutral
Like an underdone, well, cake.
  Positive
Aniston certainly doesnt need an Oscar nomination to validate what she achieves as a chronic pain sufferer.
  Positive
It is not so much that she doesnt wear makeup or her hair is limp and greasy.
  Negative
Or that squiggly scars are plastered on her face and limbs, the cause of which takes a ridiculous amount of time to be revealed in dribs and drabs.
  Neutral
Its the desperate-for-relief look in her eyes and the way that every move she makes is an ordeal.
  Negative
Even the small groans and grunts she regularly emits are more agonizing in their restraint than a full-out scream would be.
  Negative
As well-off L.A. divorcee Claire Simmons, she is cranky.
  Negative
She is bitter.
  Neutral
She is highly inappropriate, especially when she sleeps with her gardener.
  Negative
She lies to get what she wants and steals to get what she needs  which usually are Percocet and maybe OxyContin with a voluminous chaser of white wine.
  Negative
Even those who are paid to be nice and caring, like her swim therapy instructor, cant stand to be around her.
  Negative
If Raid manufactured a human repellant, it would be called Claire.
  Negative
In the very first scene she gets kicked out of her touchy-feely support group led by an insufferably simpy leader a nearly unrecognizable  Felicity Huffman for expressing her admiration for a member named Nina who summoned the nerve to leap off a freeway overpass to her death.
  Negative
The domino effect of weeping that her words induce is sickly amusing.
  Positive
Claire is basically the Bad Santa of patients.
  Negative
The one humanizing slice of Cake that is tolerable is Claires relationship with her Mexican housekeeper, Silvana the terrific Adrianna Barraza, who was Oscar-nominated for s  Babel.
  Positive
The natural-born nurturer might be a saint as she puts up with Claires rudeness, awful behavior and constant demands.
  Negative
But she isnt stupid.
  Negative
Probably the best sequence in Cake is when Claire tells Silvana she has to drive her across the border to replenish her supply of illegal pills at a Tijuana pharmacy.
  Positive
The clerk offers to stash the drugs in a holy statue.
  Negative
I have problems with anything religious, Claire gripes.
  Negative
You have bigger problems, he rightfully notes.
  Negative
However, a restaurant encounter where Claire comes to Silvanas rescue suggests there is some hint of kindness lurking beneath that brittle exterior.
  Neutral
If Cake were just the Claire and Silvana show, it might have been more tolerable.
  Negative
The see-saw act between privileged mistress and tolerant worker is in its way intriguing, since Silvana is far richer in what matters than Claire.
  Positive
I would even allow room for the cameos by that freakish opossum who pays nocturnal visits to the backyard pool.
  Negative
But there is a plot to tell and Cake starts to fall flat every time Claire hallucinates that Ninas ghost has materialized in the form of  Anna Kendrick oozing mean-girlish attitude to discuss the ins and outs of pulling off a suicide.
  Negative
Clearly, Claire is suffering from please-put-me-out-of-my-misery envy in a very big way.
  Negative
Director  Daniel Barnz and writer  Patrick Tobin allow matters to get truly questionable when Claire hunts down and hangs out with the sad husband  Sam Worthington of  Avatar, with cute Aussie accent intact and wee son that Nina has left behind.
  Negative
Romance isnt exactly in the air, yet there is a connection.
  Positive
Will Claire clean up her act or simply have a doozy of a meltdown?
  Neutral
Or both?
  Neutral
Or will a shady stranger suddenly show up and agree to bake her a cake to better justify the title of the movie?
  Neutral
It doesnt matter.
  Neutral
I like Anistons Claire.
  Neutral
I rank her right up there with  Frances McDormands Olive Kitteridge,  Edie Falcos Nurse Jackie and  Robin Wrights First Lady on House of Cards as damaged women you shouldnt necessarily admire but cant help but love.
  Neutral
