But considering its  setting and low budget, aside from costuming this format provides all the production design Stinking Heaven needs.

As it sometimes places these s characters into guerrilla scenes shot amongst 's details with unsuspecting extras, Stinking Heaven is an experience where fiction and nonfiction blend, as do place and time.

Silvers film is bizarrely, triumphantly elevated in the process it is able to dent your soul like any thoroughly genre movie, where a tangible truth is even more palpable within intentional, stylistic artifice i.e. rain scenes in romance movies that feel sincere.

With exhilarating confidence, Silver directs his ensemble of breakthrough talent sometimesunapologetically clunky line-readings and all like he's conducting a tight noise rock band, where an unpredictability in character and atmosphere doesn't impede on control of the big picture.

Two of them are heartbreaking scenes centered around Tallie Medels fantastic performance as Courtney, whose last sequence emotionally clobbered me, minimizing me to tears.

  Negative
By no coincidence, this moment was also the confirmation of Silver's must-follow status, especially as a filmmaker who can orchestrate a cinematic chaos all his own.
