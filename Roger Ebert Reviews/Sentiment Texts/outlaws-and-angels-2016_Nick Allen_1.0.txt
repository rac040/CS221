Outlaws amp' Angels puts any disappointment felt about  Quentin Tarantinos recent, bloated Western  The Hateful Eight into perspective.
  Negative
This Western too focuses on a group of morally grotesque folk spending most of their time under one roof, while encountering pain as means for revenge, as distinctly shot on film.
  Negative
But the difference between Tarantino and his endless imitators has always proved vast, especially when a budding filmmaker cribs his style to shallow results.
  Negative
A movie hopped up on the period piece sadism within Tarantinos regurgitation cinema, Outlaws amp' Angels gravely mistakes Tarantinos audaciousness for its own originality.
  Negative
At the very least, one never questions when watching a Tarantino movie if hes invested in his period.
  Negative
Thats the first huge problem with writerdirector  JT Mollners Outlaws amp' Angels, which has a nagging air of mere genre exercise from the beginning, as a group of generic bank robbers are introduced the credits graphics pointing out their individual mugs, covered in sacks amidst flat dialogue and even worse line delivery.
  Very negative
Their brief interactions after a bloody heist are intercut with the man of law pursuing them  Luke Wilson, who babbles white noise voiceover while being used at most to pose in super wide shots within lifeless montages.
  Negative
The end point belongs to the third party, a frontier family of two daughters  Francesca Eastwood and  Madisen Beaty and a mother and father  Teri Polo and Ben Browder, who are unhinged beyond their religious fanaticism for example, the older sister bullies the younger by sneaking up behind her and forcing her fingers down her throat, making her throw up, as kids so often do.
  Very negative
By the end of its first act, Outlaws amp' Angels has achieved very little.
  Negative
Theres no one that you to hope to get out alive, not even the debut writerdirector.
  Negative
So its no thrill when the outlaws led by  Chad Michael Murrays Henry, gurgling his dialogue like  Brad Pitts Lt. Aldo Raine in Inglorious Basterds show up to the house of the family at night, seeking food and flesh, and find themselves punishing the emasculated patriarch for previous incestual episodes with his daughters.
  Negative
What ensues is less horrifying than it is exceptionally desperate, as the outlaws assault members of the family, physically and sexually, with Mollner mining cheap discomfort for amoral edge.
  Very negative
A supposed hero emerges later in youngest daughter Florence Eastwood, although she slowly aligns with the bandits taste for sadism as well.
  Negative
With blonde hair, piercing eyes and a weapons-ready attitude, she is not the hero that takes us to a more concentrated, surprising third act, but merely gives us a fan fiction-level version of a Tarantino heroine.
  Negative
The centerpiece of Outlaws amp' Angels is a scene of threatened sodomy, which runs about  minutes, after a character is heard defecating themselves while being dragged away.
  Negative
It earns the designation centerpiece not for a huge narrative development that happens in the scene, but because it's clearly the moment Mollner put the most effort into' to block his actors so that they can shift in and out of the room with a camera that moves around a dinner table, all to embrace the grit that comes from not cutting away from an image captured on film.
  Negative
The failure of this scene is emblematic of the entire project: the stale dialogue between a threatening Murray and a terrified Browder would have been equally expressive in grunts and shrieks, this talky moment lacking the tension that can make Tarantinos iconic, word-driven stand-offs captivating.
  Very negative
As a single take, it only reminds the viewer of how often the movie is pointed towards showmanship watch me splatter my actress in red corn syrup in slow motion while playing an Erik Satie piece and that, not coincidentally, it has huge pacing issues.
  Negative
For whatever other Westerns may have also inspired Outlaws amp' Angels  Frances Fisher of  Unforgiven makes a brief cameo, Mollners contribution always comes back to its core Tarantino influence even the film's allegiance to Kodak film stock makes its blood-bursting action directly echo the albeit smaller-scale violence of "Django Unchained."
  Negative
But in a sea of grimy indie Westerns, especially ones that started with the same genre canvas last years  Bone Tomahawk comes to mind, and is far more innovative, Outlaws amp' Angels is a thoroughly ugly example of when Tarantino-esque is the most generous compliment.
  Negative
