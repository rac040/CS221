Over the years, there have been many attempts by filmmakers to put a comedic spin on the traditional vampire mythos that have been lackluster at best.
  Negative
Oh sure, sometimes an inspired one comes along, like  Roman Polanskis weirdo cult favorite The Fearless Vampire Killers or the hilarious recent effort What We Do in the Shadows, but more often than not, they tend to lean towards the lame and easily forgettable likes of Love at First Bite, Once Bitten or Bloodsucking Bastards.
  Negative
Even a comedy legend like  Mel Brooks couldnt pull the vampire comedy thing off when he made Dracula: Dead and Loving It, despite his deployment of the immortal line, Yes, we have Nosferatu we have Nosferatu today.
  Negative
The new Austrian import Therapy for a Vampire is the latest film to attempt to find the lighter side of bloodsuckers and it even adds a reasonably inspired idea into the mix.
  Positive
Alas, the result is a thoroughly mediocre movie that is never as amusing as it should be.
  Negative
Set in Vienna in , the film opens as no less of a figure than Sigmund Freud  Karl Fischer himself is seeing a new patient, Count Geza von Kzsnm  Tobias Moretti, for the first time.
  Negative
The Count has the usual complaints he admits that he is no good at self-reflection, has lost his thirst for life and has been married to his wife, Countess Elsa Jeanette Hain, for so long that he has grown disenchanted with her even as he continues to pine for his long-lost first love, the one who made him who he is today.
  Very negative
The joke, of course, is that what might sound like psychobabble from other patients turns out to be the literal truth from the Count because he is a vampire.
  Negative
Oddly, the great Freud doesnt quite twig to what is really going on with his patient he is so absorbed in his notes, for example, that he fails to notice that the Count is actually floating a few feet above the couch during their sessions.
  Negative
Meanwhile, Freud has also employed local artist Viktor Dominic Oley to produce a series of illustrations based upon his dreams.
  Negative
Viktor, as it turns out, has a few issues as well every time he paints a portrait of his fiance, Lucy  Cornelia Ivancan, he ends up producing a glamorous fantasy image of her instead of one resembling the more sensible person actually standing before him.
  Negative
As it turns out, the fantasy version of Lucy is the spitting image of Nadila, the lost love whose return the Count has been pining for ever since she died in Constantinople centuries earlier.
  Negative
Instantly besotted with Lucy, the Count takes advantage of Elsas overwhelming desire to have a portrait of herself painted so that she can once again have an idea of what she looks like the kind of thing that tends to slip the mind after centuries of not being able to cast a reflection in a mirror by sending her off to Viktor to paint her and using that time to woo Lucy for himself.
  Negative
In news that will shock few of you, things do not quite go as planned and get even more complicated when Ignaz  Anatole Taubman, the Counts long-suffering servant, becomes determined to have Lucy as well.
  Negative
Therapy for a Vampire never makes the transition from good idea into good movie.
  Positive
Writerdirector  David Rhm clearly knows his vampire mythology and elements such as mirrors, garlic and an obsession with counting wind up playing important roles in the proceedings.
  Negative
These moments inspire smiles here and there, but the film never quite breaks through with any big laughs, and strangely, its hook a vampire seeking therapy from Sigmund Freud gets pushed to the wayside after the opening scenes.
  Negative
The result is a film that has a few funny moments with a lot of dead air in between.
  Positive
This is a shame, as the actors are certainly game, giving the material everything they have and frequently more than it deserves.
  Negative
Therapy for a Vampire is like a -minute version of a mediocre Saturday Night Live sketch the kind that makes the final cut only because they needed something to fill time.
