Meanwhile, Sam gives the cold shoulder to one rose-giver, Kent  Logan Miller, who we eventually learn is a childhood friend that she now ignores despite his obvious infatuation with her.
  Positive
The action culminates at a rainy-night kegger held at Kents adult-free house, where matters go from bad Rob, who turns out to be a drunken lout, spends the night barfing in the sink to worse Lindsay verbally attacks and throws beer at Juliet after being called a bitch before becoming truly tragic the quartet of gal pals all appear to die in a crash when the vehicle flips over after hitting an unseen obstacle.

Sisterhood is.

  Negative
I applaud whoever thought of casting  Jennifer Beals as Sams mother, the lone grown-up who has any real impact.
