Breathtaking, erotic, grotesque, and transgressive, the film mixes watercolors influenced by Western art Klimt is in here, but so are Degas and Kandinsky with imagery ripped straight from a nightmare.

  Negative
The tale draws inspiration from a book calledSatanism and Witchcraft, a history of witchcraft published in French by  Jules Michelet in .
  Positive
That explains one of the films stranger conceits, which is that Jeannes story is actually the tale of Jeanne d'Arc Joan of Arc, the young woman who led the French army and was burned at the stake, but later beatified and canonized all by the Roman Catholic Church.
  Negative
It also links her story to Marianne, the female personification of the French Republic, depicted by Eugene Delacroix in his  painting Liberty Leading the People which appears at the end of the film.
  Negative
Michelets book set up witchcraft in the Middle Ages as a secret religion, led by a woman and drawing on pagan sources, that sought to undermine the hybrid oppressive hierarchy of the feudal system and the Roman Catholic Church.

Michelets story focuses favorably on the witches, and though its considered historically inaccurate today, its regarded as one of the first sympathetic histories of witchcraft, establishing the idea that witches heal with herbs and plants and also wield their sexuality as a weapon against the powerful.

It's portrayed as a positive thing, even if in many stories the oppressors often parents die a violent death in stark contrast to the gnarled image of an ugly witch.
  Negative
Belladonna of Sadness was released in a pivotal time for its own story: in , the women's liberation movement in Japan had begun as women marched through the streets of Tokyo, and in January , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Roe v. Wade.
  Negative
Two decades earlier,The Crucible had reframed the Salem Witch Trials as an allegory for McCarthyism, andBelladonna of Sadness especially with its explicit links to Jeanne d'Arc and Marianne suggests the story of Jeanne, the witch, as a metaphor for women's sexual liberation and, ultimately, the liberation of all people.
  Negative
That's all very high-minded, butBelladonna is still a tough watch, partly because it seems so bent on shocking every viewer that each gorgeous image is followed by something terrifying or sometimes, juvenile never has the devil been less scary than in the form of a penis with a face.
  Negative
Its rape scenes intend to convey the feeling of rape to the viewer.
  Negative
Near the beginning, it's genuinely moving, but somewhere around the middle, the film's sheer excess and occasional silliness gets exhausting.
  Neutral
But as a piece set into the history of films about witches, it's interesting' we've been obsessed with the idea of the seductive, toxic witch who beckons deliciously for a long time, and that shows no signs of fading away.
  Negative
