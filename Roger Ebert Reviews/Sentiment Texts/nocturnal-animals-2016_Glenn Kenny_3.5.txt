This may or may not be one of the best films of , but its absolutely one of the most interesting.
  Very positive
Or maybe I should say least boring.
  Neutral
If I sound puzzled, its because I am.
  Negative
Sort of.
  Neutral
A little bit.
  Neutral
Nocturnal Animals is a work of exceptional, undeniable craft, but its also a movie thats meant to stick to you a little bit.
  Positive
Indeed, so vehement is writerdirector  Tom Ford in articulating his vision at times that you think hed be disappointed by a viewer that wasnt at least a little bit angry with him over the movie.
  Negative
I know from reading the responses to the movie when it played at the Toronto Film Festival that some critics were very angry about the films opening images, which play over its opening credits.
  Negative
Im not going to be coy here they are shots of a series of naked women festooned with cheerleader regalia, shaking pom-poms and brandishing lit sparklers and such.
  Negative
The twist is, these naked women are, to a one, morbidly obese, sometimes to the point of looking deformed or mutilated, and the shots are, it should be no surprise to learn, in slow motion.
  Very negative
As I observed when I wrote about the movie in September, from the Venice Film Festival, said images arent gratuitous, or I should have said without a diegetic rationale.
  Negative
This review draws on the thoughts and words I had about the film at that September viewing.
  Positive
The cheerleaders are part of a conceptual art exhibit hosted by Amy Adams' Susan, a gallery-owning high roller in the Los Angeles art world.
  Positive
Susan is beautiful, haughty, lives an extravagant lifestyle funded largely, we assume, by her husband Hutton, played with born-into-privilege knowingness by  Armie Hammer, and thoroughly, thoroughly miserable.
  Positive
After her opening, Susan gives herself a nasty paper cut opening a package: the manuscript of a first novel by Edward Sheffield, Susans first husband.
  Negative
Shes disturbed by the package and the accompanying note.
  Positive
So disturbed that she impulsively reveals herself, indirectly, to one of her many personal assistants, asking that assistant about whether ones life choices could add up eventually to a single awful mistake.
  Negative
The assistant, who hasnt yet made any crucial life choices, has no idea what Susan is talking about.
  Negative
Susan soon settles in with Edwards novel.
  Neutral
At this point in the meticulously designed and directed film, a seemingly parallel narrative pops up.
  Negative
Tony Hastings, a refined, cultured family man, played by  Jake Gyllenhaal, is taking off on a road trip through West Texas with lovely wife  Isla Fisher and lovely but typically disaffected teen daughter  Ellie Bamber.
  Very positive
On the road, late at night, Tony and his family have a run-in with exactly the kind of people with whom you dont want to have a run-in, under any circumstances.
  Negative
From behind, from aside, and from ahead, three amped-up wastrels led by a schizzy dude named Ray  Aaron Taylor-Johnson, in a role that will earn him the legit cred hes been going after, on and off, for a while, harass Tony and his car until they both run off the road.
  Negative
Things go from bad to worse in a sequence thats one of the most discomfortingly suspenseful in a Hollywood film since, maybe,  Blue Velvet.
  Negative
We know, or at least can infer, that it isnt real, that its actually two degrees of unreal, since whats happening is a cinematic version of the novel that Edward has sent.
  Negative
The novel that Edward has dedicated to Susan.
  Positive
And why has he dedicated it to Susan?
  Positive
Is this a fictionalized version of some horrific event that happened in their own shared past?
  Negative
Not quite, it turns out.
  Negative
Soon the third narrative thread comes into play, the story of Susan and Edward, also played by Gyllenhaal.
  Positive
Theyre both young and idealistic lovers.
  Positive
He encourages her to pursue art not as a business, but as a calling.
  Positive
She wants him to be more responsible, or realistic.
  Neutral
She dreads turning into her materialistic upper-crust mother.
  Positive
Hes not so sure she dreads it.
  Negative
Emotional damage ensues, but nothing like the stuff that happens in Edwards novel.
  Negative
This is a movie that, among other things, trusts the viewer to make sense of it, or maybe demands the viewer make sense of it.
  Positive
The individual stories are kept in the air beautifully by Ford, the fashion designer whos learned a lot about the distinction between effective stylization and ostentatious stylization since his debut feature of ,  A Single Man.
  Positive
Some of its weaker moments come when Ford is at his most vehement: a scene in which Susan goes to a board meeting of an L.A. museum and interacts with a super-affected  Jena Malone is claws-out as these things go but doesnt cut to the quick.
  Negative
Malone looks funny enough, wearing a wearing a dress that looks like a rejected costume for the chessboard scene in Alice Through The Looking Glass.
  Neutral
Michael Shannon, on the other hand, achieves a career high with his dry but enigmatic portrayal of a Texas lawman with nothing left to lose.
  Negative
Abel Korzenioskis very prominent musical score is almost pure pastiche, but its accomplished: its fake  Bernard Herrmann is as convincing as its fake Phillip Glass.
  Negative
All the threads will pull together, we presume, when Edward and Susan whose current life continues to turn to rot as she makes her way through Edwards dark novel' Hutton, away on business, is cheating on her so blatantly hes almost too bored to hide it anymore meet up in real life.
  Negative
The movies final scene is one that intends to have viewers talking animatedly as they leave the theater and for a long time after, and right now my takeaway from the movie is a question: why didnt it affect me very particularly?
  Negative
But this is also a movie that suggests that not having a strong reaction is a way of having a strong reaction to something related to the movie.
  Negative
So Ill give it that.
  Positive
