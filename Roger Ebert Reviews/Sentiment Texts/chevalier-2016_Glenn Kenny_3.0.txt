Male vanity, a trait so widespread that its rarely if ever acknowledged, gets a funny albeit ultimately not terribly consequential skewering in this dry comedy from Greece.
  Negative
Chevalier is the third fictional feature from writerdirector  Athina Rachel Tsangari' her  Attenberg, an antic exploration of national identity and misandry, made waves on the festival circuit.
  Positive
Shes also an associate of  The Lobster director  Yorgos Lanthimos.
  Negative
Tsangari wrote the script for this picture with  Efthymis Filippou, a regular collaborator of Lanthimos, but while I found The Lobster almost insufferably snide and smug, Chevalier plays its cards closer to the vest, in a sense.
  Negative
The movie opens with a shot of men in diving suits emerging from the sea, flopping up from the water horizontally like whales getting beached.
  Negative
They are a well-off party of six on a private yacht, diving for fish' their leader and ostensible host is a lean, elderly man  Yiorgos Kendros referred to only as  The Doctor, or  Doc, or other diminutives.
  Negative
The other fellows are younger various shades of middle age, or approaching middle age.
  Neutral
A couple are handsome, a couple are hirsute.
  Positive
At first one most notices the lowest man on the totem pole of six there are a couple of staff members on the boat too, and they eventually constitute a social microcosm of their own, the short, dumpy, bearded Dimitris Makis Papadimitrou, a down-in-the-mouth wimp who would likely be a perfect fit for  Zach Galifianakis in the unlikely event this film were to be remade in Hollywood.
  Negative
Eventually we get to focus on the other not-quite-types, such as Yorgos, the kind of menschy one played by  Panos Koronis, who, along with director Tsangari, had a small role in  Richard Linklaters Greece-set  Before Midnight in  and Christo  Sakis Rouvas, the kind of studly one.
  Negative
The fellows, with the exception of Dimitris, whos not allowed in the water, compare the sizes of their catches, and thats all well and good for the daytime.
  Negative
In the evening, theyre bored, and sourly try to come up with games to play.
  Negative
No one is any good at cards.
  Neutral
I do not play Trivial Pursuit, one of them says with exaggerated hauteur when that game is suggested.
  Negative
Finally, one of them suggests a competition in Everything.
  Neutral
That is, they will concoct a series of contest, en masse, and each one will be scored.
  Negative
At the end of the series, the winner will be bestowed the Chevalier signet ring of the title.
  Positive
This does the trick to the extent that the fellows all decide to extend their stay.
  Negative
The fellows assign each other peculiar tasks.
  Neutral
Theres a cleaning contest, in which one of the guys gets a shellacking on account of shoddy work polishing the silver.
  Negative
Theres an Ikea assemblage competition.
  Positive
There is, as you might have expected, a penis-measuring contest.
  Negative
It is handled with visual discretion, in case you were worried andor titillated.
  Negative
As you might expect, things start to get a little tense.
  Neutral
Not just because the contests are ridiculous, and the decided-upon scoring regulations are risibly Byzantine, but also because, you know  boys will be boys.
  Very negative
Tsangari shoots the fellows antics in a studiously anti-heroic fashion, often placing the camera in voyeur-like positions, with a piece of the yachts incidental hardware intruding into the foreground of the frame.
  Positive
Christos Karamanis cinematography is almost the opposite of picturesque: some scenes are practically drained of color.
  Negative
As if the behavior of the characters themselves were not sufficiently deflating of their macho pretensions.
  Negative
There are laughs and uncomfortable observations throughout, but Tsangari never lays on too heavy a hand.
  Negative
One is free to contemplate the allegorical and satirical implications, but also free to enjoy the spectacle of self-imposed insecurity that plays out among these characters.
  Positive
By keeping things compact, the movie honors its premise modestly but with exemplary articulation.
  Negative
Chevalier is an intelligent and dry entertainment that might also make a very telling date movie.
  Positive
