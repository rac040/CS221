Feel-bad docu-essay "We Come As Friends" is a deliberately vague portrait of Sudan as a country beset by self-interested neocolonialist outsiders.
  Negative
Fitfully narrated by director  Hubert Sauper "Darwin's Nightmare", "We Come As Friends" adopts an apolitical, and largely anecdotal approach to its presentation of Sudan and its inhabitants.
  Negative
Interview subjects are almost never introduced by name since Sauper's footage is meant to be accepted on an implicit, symbolic level.
  Negative
This approach is infuriating since it constantly asks viewers to understand scenes in a general way.
  Negative
Viewers are not privileged with a more thoughtful, specific view of the institutionalized problems that Sudanese natives face because Sauper's not interested in making that kind of film.
  Negative
Instead, he provokes viewers by juxtaposing quasi-archetypal stories and loaded footage that are, as they're arranged in the film, only as meaningful as you want them to be.
  Negative
"We Come As Friends" begins and ends with an unidentified speaker rhetorically asking "Did you know that the moon belongs to the white man?"
  Negative
That pseudo-naive question makes a little more sense at the beginning of Sauper's film since it is the punchline to a story about the voracious nature of white countries who, during the Space Race, were vain enough to try to claim outer space for their respective countries.
  Negative
Sauper repeatedly sympathizes with this kind of mythical revisionist history by over-extending, though never cogently developing, its logic.
  Negative
We are told that in Sudan, rich foreigners assimilate everything.
  Positive
People sing songs about and in the voice of French, British, American, and Chinese celebrities, politicians and philanthropists.
  Neutral
Religion is perceived in binary form: there are only Christians and Muslims, and nary a Jew, Sikh, Buddhist, atheist, or anything else in between.
  Negative
Children are punished if they do not wear Western uniforms.
  Neutral
They are taught to sing about the value of "cooperating and development."
  Neutral
And outsiders are called "aliens," as in the scene where Sauper asks a trio of indifferent Chinese engineers "which planet did you come from."
  Negative
One engineer shoots back a blank stare that speaks volumes, but doesn't necessarily confirm Sauper's simplistic adopted perspective.
  Negative
At this point, I must point out that I am sympathetic to the pessimistic but pragmatic ideas that are forcefully presented throughout "We Come As Friends."
  Negative
I also think that Sauper's presentation demands a critical response.
  Neutral
Viewers even ones who are part of the choir Sauper is preaching to should not trust "We Come As Friends" because it constantly expects its audience to understand conflicts and interview segments without any contextualizing information.
  Negative
What does it matter if one engineer tells viewers to "be careful of cultural differences" while a clip from "Star Wars: A New Hope" plays on a laptop right next to Sauper's subject?
  Neutral
This clip means nothing beyond its implicit, over-burdened message.
  Negative
Like Herzog, Sauper understands images as images, and therefore values oneiric details over specific information.
  Positive
Sauper's footage is consequently only as faithful to reality as he wants it to be.
  Negative
He never focuses on any one interview subject or type of story long enough to confirm that what he's showing us is truly representative of a systemically abusive system of philanthropic aid.
  Negative
So when a group of Sudanese natives allude to "years of colonialism and oppression from the Arabs," it's unclear what Arabs they're referring to.
  Negative
Instead of clarifying the proliferation of muddled, monochromatic perspectives he finds in Sudan, Sauper prefers to just collect them in one film.
  Negative
For example, in the beginning of "We Come As Friends," Sauper tells us a story about Queen Victoria, and how she divided Africa into countries without ever visiting the continent.
  Negative
Sauper also includes footage of a playful argument he had with a Sudanese man again, not identified who calls "The Internationale" a "baby game" despite Sauper's bemusedly exasperated protests "It's a socialist hymn!"
  Negative
.
  Neutral
I didn't believe a minute of "We Come As Friends."
  Negative
It's a jumble of story fragments that are left unexamined because they look meaningful when thrown together in a single film-length presentation.
  Negative
You can buy what Sauper's selling, but I don't recommend buying it from him.
  Negative
