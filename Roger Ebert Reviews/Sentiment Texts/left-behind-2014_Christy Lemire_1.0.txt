A movie about the rapture starring  Nicolas Cage should be wackier than Left Behind.
  Negative
It should have more smoldering panic bursting into full-blown freak-outs.
  Negative
It should have more passion, more intensity.
  Positive
It should have more bees.
  Neutral
Yes, Cages howl-inducing remake of The Wicker Man from  actually feels like a legitimately good time compared to this dull groaner about the end times.
  Negative
Its a remake too: a version of Left Behind starring Kirk Cameron quickly came and went from theaters in , followed by a couple of straight-to-DVD sequels.
  Negative
All are based on the apocalyptic novels by Jerry B. Jenkins and Tim LaHaye.
  Neutral
Christian readers and audiences are the base here, but its hard to imagine that this incarnation of the story will persuade anyone else to find the Lord unless theyre sitting in the theater praying for the dialogue or special effects to improve.
  Negative
This is essentially an  Airport movie with an Evangelical spin, but it lacks the self-awareness to turn such a wild concept into a guilty pleasure.
  Neutral
Director  Vic Armstrong, a longtime stuntman making only his second feature and his first in a couple of decades, had a larger budget than the original's, and a more established star in the lead.
  Positive
None of that shows up on screen.
  Negative
The "big" set pieces look small and chintzy, the lighting is hard and flat, and the pacing is a monotonous back-and-forth between an airplane in the skies across the Atlantic and the chaos on the ground below.
  Negative
But the more serious disappointment comes from Cages performance.
  Negative
As the awesomely named Rayford Steele, a philandering airline pilot who sees the light as the end is nigh, Cage needed to bring the wild-eyed, full-bore crazy.
  Negative
This has been his bread and butter of late, and its been a thoroughly enjoyable career shift.
  Very positive
Instead, hes oddly inert as the movie's voice of reason.
  Negative
Looking distractingly rubbery with a helmet of fake, dark hair, he seems to have been Photoshopped into the film.
  Negative
His presence is so strangely awkward and unconvincing.
  Negative
Then again, the script from  Paul Lalonde who also produced the original Left Behind movies and  John Patus doesnt exactly give him or the rest of the cast much to work with.
  Neutral
Its full of flat character types and blandly expository dialogue.
  Negative
At the films start, Rayfords daughter, Chloe the perky Cassi Thomson, has come home from college for the weekend for her dads birthday.
  Negative
But Rayford got a last-minute assignment to fly from New York to London overnight, which will keep him away all that time.
  Negative
At least thats what he told his wife Irene  Lea Thompson, whos no fun anymore now that shes found Jesus and is urging everyone around her to do the same.
  Positive
The camera lingers as Irene tosses her gardening gloves on top of her ever-present Bible.
  Neutral
His real plan is to seduce a hot, blonde flight attendant  Nicky Whelan over the weekend, beginning with prime tickets to see U.
  Negative
This is actually a vaguely intriguing premise: What happens to a marriage when one spouse undergoes a religious conversion and the other does not?
  Neutral
It seems similar to what happens when one spouse gets sober and the other keeps drinking.
  Neutral
What sort of wedge does this create?
  Neutral
How does the family survive?
  Neutral
But these arent the questions Left Behind cares to ponder.
  Neutral
Armageddon is on the horizon.
  Negative
Anyway, Chloe and her dad have a brief, stilted conversation in the airport waiting area between her arrival and his departure.
  Negative
Being the skeptic that she is, she also has a confrontation about religion with a woman whos just bought a book about God at the bookstore.
  Positive
Chloe also finds time for a long chat with hunky, hotshot TV news correspondent Buck Williams, who happens to be a passenger on Rayfords flight to London.
  Negative
Chad Michael Murray takes over the role Cameron played in the original.
  Neutral
Id say thats an improvement.
  Neutral
There's a lot of sitting around and talking in Left Behind.
  Positive
But then!
  Neutral
Out of nowhere, God starts calling the pure of heart to heaven: children, mostly, but also people who have the words BIBLE STUDY written in their calendars in big capital letters.
  Negative
At first, no one realizes this is Gods doing.
  Negative
People just disappear, leaving their clothes and belongings in a pile where they once stood, including Chloes little brother and of course her mom.
  Negative
Pandemonium ensues as millions go missing worldwideor at least, implied pandemonium.
  Negative
This includes a school bus driving off an overpass and a small plane crashing into a shopping mall parking lot.
  Negative
There is zero finesse to these supposedly dramatic images.
  Negative
Mostly, Armstrong gives us a lot of people running around, flailing their hands in the air.
  Negative
Meanwhile, up in the sky, folks start disappearing, tooincluding a flight attendant and Rayfords second-in-command.
  Negative
Guess this means God really is his co-pilot.
  Positive
The barely sketched-out passengers in first class start panicking and bickering, including a Texas businessman, an Asian conspiracy theorist and a drugged-up heiress.
  Negative
Former American Idol winner Jordin Sparks fares poorly as a paranoid, unstable mom who somehow smuggled a handgun on the plane.
  Negative
Worst of all is the consistent yammering between a kindly Muslim and a surly little person.
  Negative
The movie cuts to them repeatedly for comic relief, but its painfully unfunny every time.
  Very negative
Left Behind finally edges toward an enjoyable level of insanity as it reaches its conclusion.
  Positive
I wouldnt dream of giving away the detailsmysterious ways, and allbut I will say that it involves the petite Chloe driving a steamroller in the dead of night on a deserted stretch of highway thats under construction.
  Negative
Still, for a movie that spells everything out, its unclear why God chose this particular moment to inflict his wrath upon the masses.
  Negative
Was it because Rayford tried to forsake his wedding vows with a flirty flight attendant at a U show?
  Negative
Still, if youre a true believer, its a beautiful day.
  Positive
