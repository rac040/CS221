The first round of the  NFL Draft on ESPN was watched by more than  million people.
  Negative
Its an amazing number when one considers the history of a process in which winners and losers won't be defined for years to come.
  Positive
These are viewers, most of them diehard fans, engaged in a prospect, a dream, a chance for a better future for their team.
  Positive
Will their first-round pick be Andrew Luck or Ryan Leaf?
  Neutral
Every decision is analyzed to the point of exhaustion as the popularity of the NFL is rarely more pronounced than in the fact that people are more interested in players who might hit the field in four months than those actually playing hockey, basketball, and baseball that very day.
  Negative
And it creates a pressure cooker atmosphere for those actually tasked with trying to separate the Leafs from the Lucks.
  Negative
Rabid fans make for tense executives.
  Positive
When Donovan McNabb was drafted over Texas phenom Ricky Williams in the  draft, Philadelphia almost collectively lost its mind.
  Negative
Make a mistake at the draft and you might not be around as long as the player you just picked.
  Negative
The War Room environment of decision-making on the day of the NFL draft was too enticing for Hollywood to avoid for long, and so the star-studded and cameo-heavy Draft Day arrives to offer viewers a behind-the-scenes look at how an NFL team can be broken or salvaged with just a series of negotiations and player assessments.
  Negative
Both too inside baseball for non-NFL fans to care and not nearly character-driven enough at the same time, Ivan Reitmans film is cluttered, noisy, and often nonsensical.
  Very negative
Reitman lacks confidence in the script by  Rajiv Joseph amp'  Scott Rothman and probably should and so he uses more split-screen than an episode of  in an attempt to make a flat story pop.
  Negative
Sonny Weaver, Jr.
  Neutral
Kevin Costner is having the kind of stressful month that only happens in the movies.
  Negative
Hes the general manager of the long-suffering Cleveland Browns, and has to choose between a hothead linebacker named Vontae Mack  Chadwick Boseman and a troubled running back named Ray Jennings Houston Texans star Arian Foster with the teams  pick.
  Negative
Sonnys namesake was the beloved coach of the Browns for years and just passed away in the last week.
  Negative
Because grief over his fathers passing, job tension, and the draft pick werent enough for the screenwriters, the film opens with the revelation that Sonnys girlfriend Ali  Jennifer Garner happens to be pregnant.
  Negative
Of course, Ali works with Sonny and their romance has been relatively secret.
  Neutral
Not enough movie for you?
  Neutral
Sonnys day becomes significantly more intense when the Seattle Seahawks call and offer to trade down their  pick to the Browns.
  Positive
Weaver knows he needs to make a splash and is literally told as much in a horrendously-scripted scene with his boss,  Frank Langellas Anthony Molina and so he chooses to trade his future for his present, giving the next three first-round picks to Seattle for the chance to draft Wisconsin superstar Bo Callahan Josh Pence.
  Negative
His coach  Denis Leary loses his mind and Sonny spends the rest of the day trying to figure out how to turn his draft aroundand his life, of course.
  Negative
Draft Day is well-cast.
  Neutral
Costner has the world-weariness of a man losing sleep over college kids and job security.
  Negative
Langella and Leary know how to push the right buttons when it comes to turning up the heat on our protagonist.
  Negative
Supporting roles feel well-considered, including scene-stealers like W. Earl Brown,  Terry Crews,  Sam Elliott, and  Ellen Burstyn.
  Negative
And yet all of these interesting performers can't save a dull script.
  Negative
To work, Draft Day needs the kind of witty dialogue and snappy energy that  Steve Zaillian and  Aaron Sorkin brought to  Moneyball but the screenwriters mistake constant activity for actual screenwriting.
  Neutral
Everyone serves a plot purpose in this cluttered tale instead of playing an actual person: "the girlfriend," "the coach," "the mom," "the agent," "the owner," and so on.
  Negative
They are archetypes and often fail to feel realistic even in that regard.
  Negative
Langellas Art Modell riff its no coincidence he has the same initials as the legendary Browns owner who moved the team to Baltimore in the s is a caricature, Burstyn pops up just to manipulatively tug at heartstrings, and the romance between Costner amp' Garner contains zero chemistry.
  Very negative
As if he could tell that he had a shallow script, Reitman does his best to make it all seem more interesting than it is with visual tricks.
  Negative
Characters cross split screens, creating a truly odd aesthetic in which it looks like people in separate cities are sharing the same space while talking on the phone.
  Negative
The on-screen ticking clock counting down to the draft, the pomp and circumstance of NFL logos every time a new team comes into the narrative' these are the kind of filmmaking tricks that might have enhanced a quality script but feel like a lot of window-dressing with this one.
  Neutral
In essence, its not dissimilar to what ESPN does with the actual draft, pumping it up with fanfare, high-tech graphics, and on-screen stats to give the viewer the impression theyre watching something truly important.
  Positive
What Draft Day misses is that the reason  million people watch the actual draft is because its merely the prelude to the story of their team and possibly their new favorite player, and not the whole story in itself.
  Negative
We buy into the dream because of what it could mean for our sports fandom.
  Negative
The movie about this phenomenon clutters that hope with too many characters involved in uninteresting and often unbelievable subplots, dragging the high that true sports fans feel on draft day to the ground.
  Positive
