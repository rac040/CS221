Sephi speaks no German or Polish, and Agnieszka speaks no Hebrew.
  Negative
And yet, in the course of a fraught exchange during which Agnieszka grasps Sephis wrist most aggressively, the point is made: Agnieszka knew Sephis father, and Sephis father was a murderer.

  Negative
If Past Life stumbles at all, its in the scenes in which it intercuts between Nanas medical traumas and Sephis continued detective work on a trip to Warsaw the idea of a certain kind of faith constituting a sort of lifeline is made too literal for my tastes here.
