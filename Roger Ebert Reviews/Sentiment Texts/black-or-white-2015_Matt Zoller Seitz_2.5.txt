"Black or White," a domestic drama about a custody battle over a mixed-race child, is the kind of movie you root for, because it's clearly coming from a sincere and honest place.
  Positive
But it's often painful, and not in a good way' it's painful because of the roads it doesn't explore, the shortcuts it takes, and the special pleading it can't stop itself from indulging in.
  Negative
Written and directed by  Mike Binder, and bankrolled by star  Kevin Costner, it wants to illuminate and heal through straight talk, and if you look at it purely as a commercial venture, there's no denying its specialness.
  Very negative
There are no superheroes, no robots, no dinosaurs, no guns, nothing that producers would consider exploitable elements.
  Very negative
There's no easy marketplace slot into which it can be placed and nurtured.
  Negative
It's what used to be called, in the s and 's, a "problem picture."
  Neutral
In this case the problem is racial distrust, and how it's perpetuated in a country that likes to think of itself as post-racial, and that's filled with people who think they're not racist, not at all, no sir, no ma'am.
  Very negative
Unfortunately, "Black or White" is itself part of another sort of problem: the tendency to center what ought to be an extended family's drama on the distress of a White man in this case, Costner's character, Elliott Anderson, a recently widowed and visible wealthy grandfather.
  Negative
Elliott wishes people would recognize how hard he's trying and how good his heart is, and just leave him alone in his big house with its big swimming pool and his Mexican maid to raise his young granddaughter Eloise Jillian Estell.
  Negative
The poor girl's White mother died in childbirth, and barely knew her African-American father, Reggie  Andre Holland of the excellent Cinemax series "The Knick", a drug addict who got Eloise's mother pregnant and has barely been heard from since.
  Very negative
The film starts strong in a hospital waiting room, dropping you right into the worst moment of Elliott's life: learning that his wife  Jennifer Ehle died of injuries sustained in a car wreck.
  Negative
The film's sincerity is instantly apparent, along with its sense of empathy.
  Positive
The movie has a lot of problems, which we'll deal with momentarily, but for a while, at least, deck-stacking isn't one of them.
  Negative
Elliott is no plaster saint.
  Negative
He's a Baby boomer who probably considered himself race-blind until his daughter started sleeping with Reggie and ended up bearing his child.
  Negative
But he means well, and his actions prove it.
  Positive
He quickly assumes child-raising duties once performed by his wife, including combing Eloise's hair and tying it with a bow his form is lacking, to put it mildly, and even hires a tutor, Duvan Araga  Mpho Koaho of TNT's "Falling Skies", to help the girl with math homework that he can't make heads or tails of.
  Negative
Then Eloise's grandmother Rowena Jeffers  Octavia Spencer enters the picture and agitates for custody of Eloise.
  Neutral
She's a pillar of the community who lives in a modest but comfortable house in South Central L.A. and owns two other homes and six businesses.
  Positive
He motivations in the custody fight, like Elliott's, are complex and conflicted: self-serving in some ways, quite reasonable in others.
  Positive
She wants Eloise to explore the other side of her heritage by spending time with her African-American relatives.
  Positive
She wants the girl to grow up surrounded by loved ones who can support her during a period of grieving, rather than living in near-isolation in a big, bland house with grandpa and his maid.
  Neutral
And she wants to keep Eloise safe by giving her a haven from Elliott's drinking, which has grown so severe in the aftermath of his wife's death that he pays Duvan to drive Eloise to school while he sits in the passenger seat, muttering and reeking of booze.
  Negative
Binder, who oversaw one of Costner's best performances in " The Upside of Anger," based this story on what happened to his nephew, a biracial child whose dad was out of the picture and whose mom died at .
  Positive
There are scenes in which seeming voices of reason say and do petty, self-destructive or outright stupid things, and scenes in which irritating or fundamentally untrustworthy characters blurt out something that's undeniably true.
  Negative
The performances range from solid to excellent.
  Very positive
First among equals is Costner, who's fearless about letting Elliott be hurtful, maudlin and pathetic at times.
  Positive
Spencer puts across Rowena's common sense and bulldozer righteousness as well as an impulsive, self-defeating busybody quality that alarms her own adult kids' their ranks include her son Jeremiah  Anthony Mackie, a lawyer who warns Rowena that the only way to win custody is to paint Elliott as a racist, a charge that's probably true in certain ways but that will need to be puffed up to monstrous dimensions in court.
  Negative
But too often the actors seem to struggle with dialogue and situations that turn their characters into clownish adversaries and stick-figure obstacles.
  Negative
Mackie's lawyer is one casualty: he's there mainly to inflame tensions and push Rowena to green-light extreme and ultimately counterproductive tactics.
  Negative
Another is Holland, who deserves a medal for making an increasingly repellent and nonsensical character watchable.
  Negative
To its credit, "Black or White"  keeps  insisting that we sympathize with Reggie's struggle to stay clean, and understand that he's been placed in an impossible position: Rowena's side of the family has a better shot at custody if he can prove he's cut out to be a father, but you need only look into his haunted, guilty eyes to see that he's not.
  Negative
Unfortunately, Reggie ends up validating White stereotypes of absentee Black fathers who would rather smoke crack than raise their kids' he's a hapless version of the sort of bogeyman that might have made its way into a s State of the Union address about the failures of liberalism.
  Very negative
The movie never subverts the stereotype, even in its more laudable moments, such as a nifty bit of crosscutting that reminds us that Reggie's drug habit and Elliott's drinking are both about numbing unbearable pain.
  Negative
In the end, "Black or White" is too disorganized and pokey, and too comfortable with sitcom-like clowning, to truly illuminate or heal .
  Negative
Too many scenes verge on sitcom broadness, and even the more delightfully original supporting players including Duvan, who speaks several languages fluently and has written thesis papers on every conceivable subject wear out their welcomes.
  Negative
Worse still is the way that "Black or White" keeps the focus on Elliott rather than distributing its screen time more democratically, a strategy that might have countered complaints that the film is mainly concerned with proving that Elliott is not a racist, and that by extension, White viewers who identify with Elliott aren't racists, either.
  Negative
The movie uses the n-word in a couple of pivotal scenes, and not casually either, but it's impossible to congratulate the film for daring to go there when Elliott gets the chance to explain himself and launches into what sounds like the sort of half-apology, half-excuse that a White movie star might make after being caught using bigoted language in public.
  Negative
His assertion that most people have racist thoughts from time to time, but what matters isn't our first thought but our second and third, rings true.
  Negative
But putting it in the mouth of a rich White man is still a baffling strategic mistake though not nearly as ill-advised as establishing Reggie's weak claim on custody by revealing that he doesn't know how to spell his daughter's name.
  Negative
And the melodramatic climax, which momentarily endorses Elliott's ugliest fears, is such a tawdry betrayal of the movie's nobler impulses that "Black or White" never recovers from it.
  Negative
This movie is the kind of failure that makes you frustrated and sad rather than angry.
  Very negative
Its heart is in the right place, but its mind is confused.
  Negative
