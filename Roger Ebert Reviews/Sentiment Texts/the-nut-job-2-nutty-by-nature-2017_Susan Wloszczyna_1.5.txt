Like any genre, the quality of animated features rises and falls with the Hollywood tide.
  Negative
Sometimes, we are lucky to be rewarded with  Inside Out, an instant-classic exploration of human emotions.
  Positive
Other times, we get a reflection of the year in progress namely, that films brainless cousin,  The Emoji Movie.
  Negative
While much has been written about a spate of lackluster blockbusters this summer, little has been said about the dearth of mainstream standouts among toon releases so far.
  Negative
The Lego Batman Movie, built upon the toy universe already introduced in  The Lego Movie, has its fans and those who love the book series embraced Captain Underpants.
  Positive
But if the best that critics could say about  Cars  was that it wasnt as bad as its predecessor, that is a very low bar from which to judge.
  Negative
So along comes The Nut Job : Nutty by Nature to push that bar ever downward.
  Negative
Never for a second did I think the original film which basically co-opted Scrats single-minded pursuit of his acorn in the  Ice Age franchise for its own food-motivated, self-serving lead rodent, Surly Squirrel abrasively voiced by returnee  Will Arnett would qualify for a sequel.
  Negative
Maybe only as a punishment for those children who made their parents sit through its predecessor, but thats it.
  Negative
But here is our second helping, one that is noisier, busier, crasser and more laugh-free than the first outing.
  Negative
Why, you may ask?
  Negative
Money, of course.
  Neutral
With a reported budget of  million, the Canadian-South Korean-American production grossed over  million worldwide half of it in countries beyond the U.S. and Canada.
  Negative
Therefore, here we go again, with purple-hued Surly and his fur-bearing posse of chipmunks, groundhogs, moles, woodchucks, beavers and mice spending their days in the quaintly generic town of Oakton City, gorging on a seemingly endless stash of shell-bearing legumes in the basement of the now-shuttered Nut Shop.
  Negative
Looking down upon their glutton-like existence is girl-squirrel Andie  Katherine Heigl, back again, who bemoans their lack of discipline while insisting they should do what comes naturally namely, forage for food in Liberty Park right across the street.
  Negative
She is supposed to be a moral center, but Andie is mostly a kill-joy nag as she blah blah blahs about being part of a team and the value of hard work in other words, heavy-handedly injecting a de rigueur message into the proceedings.
  Negative
Well, before you can say kaboom, the store blows up and all the nuts are toast.
  Negative
To feed their starving cohorts, Surly and his mostly silent blue mouse pal Buddy attempt to snatch doughnuts away from, of course, cops and abscond with popcorn found outside a movie theater, but to no avail.
  Negative
Just as the critters attempt to search for sustenance in the park, bulldozers and construction workers suddenly descend upon the oasis of greenery.
  Negative
That is because the towns corpulent wealthy mayor  Bobby Moynihan is a greedy and corrupt politician who disdains rules and cares little about the environment big game trophy heads bedeck the walls of his ornate home after previously turning a public space into a golf course.
  Negative
He now has plans to turn Liberty Park into a very profitable and unsafe amusement park by cutting every corner he can.
  Negative
If this sounds familiar, I am guessing it isnt a coincidence.
  Negative
Surly and the others join forces as they try to sabotage the crews destroying the property.
  Negative
But the mayor hires an animal control company to keep them at bay and his evil plot to make money while endangering lives by installing faulty rides continues apace.
  Negative
Will our heroes, such as they are, fight back?
  Positive
And will one of them accidentally fall into a coma and inspire a supposedly touching flashback about the value of friendship?
  Negative
And will that moldy oldie Born to be Wild become the go-to tune for each round of loud and violent mayhem?
  Negative
Yes, yes and yes.
  Neutral
Lets look on the bright side.
  Positive
The running time is barely  minutes.
  Negative
And there are but three fairly amusing characters who save this inferior attempt at family entertainment, at least for me.
  Negative
Once again,  Maya Rudolph is a highlight as Precious, a bug-eyed pug with a penchant for licking the fur of fellow beasts.
  Negative
Here, she is rewarded with a French bulldog beau named Frankie who is so besotted by her, he regurgitates his food so she wont go hungry.
  Negative
OK, that's gross.
  Negative
But the fact that  Bobby Cannavale provides his voice and probably influenced his poochs handsome visage sort of makes up for it.
  Positive
Plus, I laughed every time he says that, like Brangelina before them, he and Precious are Fracious.
  Positive
Then there is the delight of hearing  Jackie Chan voice Mr. Feng, a wee Asian mouse and martial-arts master who abhors being called cute while preferring to be known as a weapon of mouse destruction.
  Positive
He and his look-alike army partly redeem a protracted last face-off with their cleverly animated kung-fu moves.
  Neutral
But whatever charm this trio provides is snuffed out by two off-putting human creatures the mayors bratty, belligerent daughter Isabella Moner who shrieks most of her lines while making Veruca Salt seem like a paragon of propriety and the main animal control officer  Peter Stormare of  Fargo bad-guy fame who, for whatever reason, references  when he tells his troops, Tonight we dine on squirrel.
  Negative
Alas, resistance is basically futile at this point, since The Nut Job , also directed by No.
  Negative
s Carl Brunker, is already in pre-production according to IMDb.
  Negative
I'm just hoping the subtitle will be Release the Cracker.
  Negative
