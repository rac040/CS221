The first poster released for Lars von Trier's "Nymphomaniac" had a Brady-Bunch structure, with images of all the main actors stacked on top of one another, each individual lost in the exact moment of sexual climax.
  Negative
The poster was eye-catching and funny, private and exhibitionistic at the same time.
  Positive
Sex may be "natural" and "good" according to George Michael, but seeing sex onscreen either actual or simulated is often a game-changer.
  Positive
We all may do it, but how do you put it onscreen in a way that is representative of the messhumoractuality of it?
  Negative
How do you represent sex and also incorporate emotion?
  Neutral
Human beings are often very silly about sex, especially when they get too philosophical about it.
  Negative
It's like getting philosophical about a sneeze.
  Neutral
Unlike a sneeze, sex carries lifetimes of associations with it, and yet naked writhing bodies onscreen often flatten out into a general cliche representing a hazy idea of the act.
  Negative
The best part of Lars von Trier's fascinating, engaging and often didactic "Nymphomaniac" is that, despite the sometimes-grim tone and bleak color palate, it's an extremely funny film, playful, even.
  Very positive
It's outrageous and provocative, intellectual and primal at sometimes the same time.
  Positive
It features of a lot of what looks like actual sex although we are told in the end credits that the penetrative sex depicted was done by body doubles, and while it is obviously interested in sex, it is more interested in how we talk about sex, how we incorporate it into our identity or don't.
  Positive
Similar to " Melancholia," von Trier's masterful examination of depression, and how it feels like an outside force working on those who suffer from it, "Nymphomaniac" which will be released in multiple volumes sees sex through the eyes of a damaged woman who has made it her mission in life to remove sex from our  "love-fixated society".
  Positive
She says, flatly, "Love is blind.
  Negative
No, it's worse.
  Neutral
It distorts something.
  Neutral
It's something I never asked for."
  Neutral
Charlotte Gainsbourg plays the androgynously named Joe, who, at the opening of Volume I, is discovered lying bruised and battered in a dark alley by Seligman  Stellan Skarsgrd.

Seligman takes her in, tucks her in bed, and gives her tea.
  Neutral
He is a complete stranger and he asks what happened.
  Negative
She warns him up front that it will not be a nice story, that she is a bad person.
  Negative
He assures her that nothing she tells him will shock him.
  Negative
He thinks she may be being too hard on herself.
  Negative
There's something almost unfinished about Joe, a flat affect, as she insists that her behavior has been beyond-the-pale.
  Negative
As the rain pours down, she  tells him her story.
  Neutral
It's a blatant theatrical device, an artificial framing, and von Trier  uses it unabashedly.The film is broken up into titled-sections, each with their own narrative thru-line and tone.
  Negative
Occasionally, we go back to the bedroom with Seligman and Joe, when he interrupts her to ask a question about what she just said, or he interrupts to go off on his own  tangent of thought.
  Negative
He is not freaked out by what Joe tells him.
  Negative
On the contrary, he is delighted by it, and seems delighted by the opportunity to talk about all of these important matters in an in-depth spit-balling kind of way.
  Positive
Seligman is a big fly-fisher, and much of what Joe describes, her various tactics with men, her use of different kinds of "lures", reminds him of his favorite hobby.
  Negative
Part of the delight in "Nymphomaniac" is its disinterest in being anything other than fully itself.
  Positive
That "self" may change on a moment-to-moment basis, which makes "Nymphomaniac" a dizzying experience.
  Negative
The film is sometimes stylized, other times totally realistic.
  Positive
Mathematical equations appear on the screen, counting out the sexual pumps from Joe's first lover.
  Negative
There are intricate diagrams of a parallel parking job, showing the swooping parabolae necessary to fit a certain car into a certain spot.
  Positive
A chalkboard lists questions all starting with the letter "W".
  Neutral
There are long conversations about Edgar Allan Poe, Bach, and Fibonacci numbers.
  Negative
"Nymphomaniac" requires an audience to submit to these segues, to go with the flow, to hand over  control.
  Negative
In the flashback sections of Volume I, the young Joe is played by  Stacy Martin, being raised by a "cold bitch" of a mother, and a kindly doctor father  Christian Slater who passes on to his daughter a love of flora and fauna.
  Negative
She discovers early on that when she touches herself between her legs, she gets what she calls "the sensation".
  Positive
Joe views her virginity as something that needs to be gotten rid of pronto, so she hits up a local rough-around-the-edges mechanic named Jerome  Shia LaBeouf to do the deed' he complies with very little ceremony and no  preamble.
  Negative
Jerome keeps entering the film, through various hard-to-believe coincidences.
  Positive
The mechanic somehow is transformed into a pencil-pushing office manager.
  Positive
When Jerome re-appears for the third time, Seligman, still listening, calls Joe on embellishing the story.
  Negative
This is sounding fictional now, cries Seligman.
  Negative
She must be making this up!
  Positive
Von Trier uses Brechtian distancing devices like that to comment on his own story, even as he meticulously sets up each self-contained  section.
  Negative
He knows we're going "in and out" of the action, he knows we're going to have questions and doubt her reliability as a narrator.
  Positive
In fact, he counts on it.
  Neutral
Young Joe, once she lost her virginity, starts her quest to have as much sex as she possibly can.
  Negative
Her partner-in-crime for this is a young friend who is even more daring, and who comes up with various sexual competitions.
  Positive

  Negative
Joe is amazed to discover how easy it is.
  Positive
She tells Seligman of her learning curve, the tactics and strategies she used as she worked that train.
  Positive
Every man is different.
  Neutral
She is cold and calculating about it, and the scene really captures the restlessness and kamikaze bravery of young girls first trying out their sexual powers without knowing at all what they are doing.
  Negative
"Nymphomaniac" does not judge Young Joe and her friend.
  Negative
The only person judging Young Joe is the mature Joe, wrapped up in blankets, telling Seligman the story.
  Positive
Every time Seligman interrupts, Joe reminds him that his feelings about her will change once he hears the whole story.
  Neutral
It's a hook, a tease, the film's own fly-fishing "lure".
  Negative
In one sequence, Joe relates the difficulties of juggling seven different lovers.
  Negative
Often the lovers meet at her door, one guy leaving as the other guy arrives.
  Neutral
Things get messy.
  Negative
Joe may be able to separate sex from emotion as a matter of fact, that is her goal, but it is not as easy for others.
  Negative
One guy shows up at her door, holding a couple of suits in dry-cleaning bags, announcing he has finally left his wife and is moving in.
  Negative
Joe is horrified, even more so when the scorned wife, known only as Mrs. H.  Uma Thurman, whose manic vicious performance is one of the film's high points and tips "Nymphomaniac" over into out-and-out screwball shows up at the door with her three children.
  Negative
She wants the boys to see where Daddy has been spending all his time.
  Positive
"Come, boys, let's go look at the whoring bed!"
  Positive
exclaims Mrs. H. brightly.
  Positive
The American actors use on-again off-again British accents, which adds to the blas humor of the thing.
  Positive
It's not important where these people are.
  Negative
It's not even important who they are.
  Negative
It's important what they do, and it's important how they think about what they do.
  Positive
"Nymphomaniac" does not make the mistake of suggesting that Joe's behavior is connected to a bad experience in her childhood.
  Negative
This is not a redemption narrative or a trauma narrative, at least not yet.
  Negative
Sex feels good all on its own' sex is its own reward.
  Positive
Seligman sometimes misses the point of Joe's narrative, musing about how addiction can dull a person's moral apparatus.
  Negative
Joe wants to make sure she is perfectly clear with him: She embraced sex because of the  "sensation" it provided her.
  Positive
The power she had over men was secondary.
  Positive
She loves lust, and her lust makes her heartless.
  Positive
Well, it's a heartless world.
  Positive
Joe sees herself as an outlaw, taking charge of her own hunger, and as a young woman she and her group of  fellow outlaw friends create a club which has an Erica Jong-like mission statement: "We have the right be horny."
  Positive
The fact that the club shuns members who sleep with the same guy twice is an explicit acknowledgement of the bonding emotional power of sex, something the girls all want to  avoid.
  Negative
Volume I ends on a wrenching note, with Joe at a painful crossroads in her own sexual philosophy, and scenes from Volume II unfurl alongside the roll of credits.
  Negative
All of the talk in Volume I about lust and sensation and "cocks" we get a gallery of different penises flashing  across the screen translates into some extremely dreary sex in "Nymphomaniac", boring, bored, silly, embarrassing.
  Negative
You look at some of it and think, "What on earth is the point?"
  Neutral
None of it is erotic.
  Negative
All that pounding and thrusting and grinding adds up to a keening unspoken awareness of the emptiness at the center of humanity, the looming presence of death, the doomed possibilities of not only connection, but feeling itself.
  Negative
Sex can be many things, it can express love, hate, power, revenge.
  Positive
It can relieve boredom.
  Negative
It can be overlaid with intellectual considerations, or concerned with concepts such as consent, objectification, misogyny, the entire history of cultural baggage people bring into bed with them.
  Negative
"Nymphomaniac: Vol.
  Neutral
I" addresses these heavy  topics, but in a way that doesn't feel heavy at all.
  Negative
The film is an intellectual high-wire act, death-defying, dangerous, entertaining, and delighting in its own inventiveness and daring.
  Negative
