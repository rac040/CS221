Meyerhoff isnt the only name to remember from I Believe in Unicorns, as the film simply wouldnt work at all without the committed, fantastic performance of Natalie Dyer.

She balances the innocence and desire of her character in perfectly equal measures, sketching a person in that dangerous part of life in which they are not a child and yet also not quite yet a woman.

She holds every scene, adding emotional weight to clichs that would have been paper-thin without her work.

I Believe in Unicorns sometimes gets a bit too Film School Project and doesnt quite fill out a feature film its not even  minutes with long credits on both sides but it works on its own terms.
  Negative
Most of all, it is an introduction to two people I hope to see in the next festival line-up I receive: Leah Meyerhoff and Natalie Dyer.
