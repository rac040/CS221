"Silence" is a monumental work, and a punishing one.
  Very positive
It puts you through hell with no promise of enlightenment, only a set of questions and propositions, sensations and experiences.
  Negative
It is no surprise to learn that the film's director,  Martin Scorsese, has been working on it for decades, since he first read the  source novel by  Shsaku End about Jesuit priests suffering for their faith in th century Japan, where Christianity is outlawed.
  Negative
I can't think of another Scorsese film that's so intent on simply showing us things and letting us consider their meaning.
  Negative
There's a little bit of voiceover narration and a few shots that go inside characters' perceptions, but for the most part you're an observer, watching people from a purposeful distance.
  Negative
The film starts with a long moment of actual silence, and embraces silence throughout its running time, or something akin to silence.
  Positive
Wood burning, waves crashing, wind moving through grass: this is what you often hear in place of a musical score.
  Positive
When "Silence" is not quiet, you wish that it were, because the soundtrack is filled with moans of pain and screams of agony and the sounds of bones being broken and flame searing flesh.
  Negative
And, of course, during such moments you fear silence, too, because the grave is silent.
  Negative
The story is simple: two priests  Andrew Garfield and  Adam Driver leave Portugal for Japan to find a third priest  Liam Neeson who has gone missing while working as a missionary.
  Negative
The third priest is believed to have committed apostasy by stepping on an image of Jesus Christ after being tormented by the Japanese.
  Negative
Eventually, one of these wandering priests Garfield's character,Father Sebastio Rodrigues gets captured and goes through a similar experience, surviving torture and witnessing the torture of others while pondering unanswerable questions: How much suffering can a man take before breaking and renouncing that which is most important to him?
  Negative
If he does break, does it mean he has failed God?
  Negative
Does God want him to resist blasphemy no matter what the cost?
  Neutral
Or does he want the priest to give up and renounce his faith, secure in the knowledge that God's love is great enough to forgive him for not being able to endure unendurable pain?
  Neutral
Is God indifferent to the suffering?
  Neutral
Does He even notice it?
  Neutral
The movie starts with the first priest,Father Cristvo Ferreira Neeson, witnessing mass torture of Christians and being told that if he will only commit apostasy, the suffering will cease.
  Negative
The story then jumps forward many years to find Father Rodrigues and his partner,Father Francisco Garrpe Adam Driver, as they make their way to Japan by way of Macao with help from a Japanese Christian whose own faith seems reawakened by serving as their guide.
  Negative
The first hour of the film is a somewhat picaresque narrative that slowly builds dread as the priests get closer to figuring out what happened their predecessor.
  Negative
The Japanese authorities don't take kindly to Europeans wandering around their island nation talking about the glories of Jesus.
  Negative
In fact, they see Christianity as a cancer to be cut from the body politic.
  Negative
In the film's second half, Father Rodrigues finds himself locked in a wooden cage and forced to watch and hear the torture of Japanese Christians some of whom followed and helped him.
  Negative
He is plagued by doubts, not just about the wisdom of coming to Japan or his capacity to survive this ordeal, but the wisdom of the missionary enterprise, which expects people to suffer and die on behalf of ideals.
  Negative
The priest even begins to wonder what God wants, what He's thinking, and whether He has a point-of-view on misery and pain.
  Negative
What would Jesus do?
  Neutral
A lot of people in Father Rodrigues' position would interpret that as a physical challenge:if Christ withstood the agonies of the cross, I can get through this.But Christ wasn't mortal, so it's an unfair test.
  Negative
But what if the unfairness of the test is the test?
  Neutral
And what of the other prisoners in the facility with the priest?
  Neutral
All it would take to end their suffering or so the priest is told is one footprint on the image of the savior.
  Neutral
Is it moral to allow others to suffer when their suffering can be ended with a single symbolic gesture?
  Neutral
Would God want that?
  Neutral
Maybe the priest is destined to realize that its all right to apostatize if it ends the pain of others.
  Positive
Scorsese and his co-screenwriter  Jay Cocks the two did uncredited rewrites on " The Last Temptation of Christ" have been accused by some of my colleagues of glorifying the European missionaries, or at least not examining them in a critical enough way.
  Negative
I didnt get this out of Silence at all.
  Negative
In fact, one of the things that impressed me most about it was the care it devotes to understanding the position of the Japanese authorities.
  Positive
Without condoning their brutality, it lets a major character Inoue Masashige  Issei Ogata, one of the officials in charge of eradicating Christianity from Japan, and the supervisor of the heros suffering explain the official point-of-view on Western religion.
  Negative
He doesnt just consider it a corrupting influence on Japanese culture, he doubts that Christianity can truly take root in the swamp his word of his home country.
  Negative
There are echoes here of another recurring Scorsese fascination, the self-preservation instinct of the tribe.
  Positive
The tribe may tolerate rebellion, heresy or external threats up to a point, but after that they crack down mercilessly.
  Negative
Scorsese's respectful distance makes the suffering more unbearable than it would be if he showed every atrocity in close-up.
  Negative
It's unsettling because it conflates the point-of-view of God and the point-of-view of the audience.
  Neutral
You're paralyzed.
  Neutral
You want to act, or you want the movie to act, to stop the suffering, but the suffering continues until finally it doesn't.
  Negative
We're watching men of God being tested.
  Negative
Try as they might, they cannot entirely wrap their minds around the purpose of the test, and when they do grapple with it, they worry that they've arrived at the wrong conclusion.
  Negative
They worry that theyve missed the point' that they're not faithful enough or smart enough to understand why this horror exists, or must exist.I dont know what to think of the ending of the film, which I wont discuss here except to say that Ive changed my mind about it many times, and that it seems to be constructed to encourage viewers to come at it again from new angles rather than settling on a single conclusion.This is not the sort of film you like or don't like.
  Negative
It's a film that you experience and then live with.
  Positive
Scorsese has been here before, in one sense or another not just in straightforwardly theological dramas such as " Kundun" and "The Last Temptation of Christ," but in his crime pictures and thrillers as well.
  Negative
The entire running time of "Silence" could be the self-flagellating fantasy of the young hoodlum hero of Scorsese's  breakthrough " Mean Streets" as he holds his hand over a flame the title character in " Taxi Driver" did the same thing, and the terrors visited upon the priests and their flock are sadistic enough to have come straight from the reptile brain of Max Cady in " Cape Fear," a devil or demon figure who exists to punish people for the sins of weakness, hypocrisy and pride.
  Negative
But "Silence" foregrounds such things in the manner of a parable that is not intended to lead the listener to a single realization but to stimulate thought and emotion.
  Negative
This, too, is characteristic of Scorsese, who studied to be a priest but became a monk for cinema, and who nonchalantly describes himself as a "lapsed Catholic" yet has been preoccupied with sin and salvation for nearly  years and weaves Christian themes, imagery and situations throughout his work.
  Negative
You even find them in what might otherwise be straightforward commercial genre projects "Cape Fear," " The Departed" and " The Color of Money" spring to mind in which Scorsese seems to be using theology to frame his story and characters in ways that he understands, maybe as a way of personalizing a story that's not all that personal otherwise.
  Negative
For a lapsed Catholic he sure does see the entire world in terms of imponderables and spiritual tests.
  Positive
Maybe theres an alternate reality in which Scorsese became a priest.
  Neutral
I bet he was a good one.
  Positive
