The consequences of seemingly innocuous careless moments, the inexorability of fate, and the possibility of grace or just mere reconciliation in the face of disheartening catastrophe: these are the themes of Bluebird, the debut feature from writerdirector  Lance Edmands.
  Negative
The movie is set in a Maine logging and paper-manufacturing town that is deliberately made to seem at a far remove from the larger world.
  Negative
Edmands peppers the films soundtrack with gentle, moody, vintage tunes from the likes of The Fleetwoods, which contributes a slightly eerie, floating-atop-time feel to the picture.
  Negative
School bus driver Lesley  Amy Morton is established as conscientious and caring by the way she donates her own wool cap to a youngster who forgot to don one on the bright winter day on which the film opens' still, her solid character doesnt prevent her from making an erroneous head count after she parks the bus.
  Negative
Combine this with a single mom who blacks out in her bathtub before it occurs to her to wonder where her child is, and, well The boy, nearly frozen overnight, winds up in the hospital with a highly diminished function.
  Negative
Lesley is devastated and wracked with guilt' her husband Richard  John Slattery and adolescent daughter Paula  Emily Meade are hard-pressed to process the events.
  Negative
As is the boys mother, Maria Louisa Krause and his tough grandmother Crystal  Margo Martindale.
  Negative
Bluebird proceeds quietly from this shattering, bleak point.
  Negative
Edmands scenario provides plenty of opportunity for narrative twists and social commentary, but these arent the areas of interest for the filmmaker.
  Positive
Rather, hes interested in the people, and what they look like, how they behave, as they cope, or fail to cope.
  Negative
The resolution of the film doesnt come in the form of a eureka moment in the investigation, or the filings of the lawyer who cagily presents his services and hints at their potential rewards to Maria and Crystal at the hospital.
  Neutral
It comes in the looks on the faces of the characters as they make the determination to try to live their lives.
  Neutral
Its not easy.
  Neutral
Lesley in particular cannot find her way out of the rut of grief and shame she feels at her mistake' to see it compounded by the loss of her job is stomach-churning.
  Very negative
Richards frustration finds a transformation into potentially destructive, ultimately impotent rage.
  Negative
Paulas resentment at having what should be a fun time in her teens turned into a supporting role in a tragedy also comes up against a wall.
  Negative
And Marias anger and denial explode in a confrontation with Lesley that solves nothing.
  Negative
The cast members are all exceptional' while the movies incredible roster of acting talent suggests an ensemble piece, the structure of the movie patiently presents a series of scenes between two or three characters  Adam Driver also has a role as a co-worker of Marias, and acquits himself stolidly.
  Positive
The ultra-widescreen cinematography of  Jody Lee Lipes makes the viewer feel the cold of the setting, the near-desolation of the long winding roads that swing around the forest that feeds the paper mill.
  Negative
All of these views suggest a striving toward spiritual epiphany, on the part of both the movies characters and the movie itself.
  Positive
The nature of the setting in a sense suggests Faro, the island on which  Ingmar Bergman set and shot some of his most bracing studies of humanity and God, or the lack thereof' Edmands clear appreciation of the expressive qualities of a non-expressive human face is in the tradition of Bresson.
  Negative
Which is not to say that the filmmaker has hit those particular heights here.
  Negative
The movie, like so many independently-produced character-driven dramas these days, is too fond of its two-note-piano-chords-and-strings score although this one, by Daniel Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans, has a little more modernist heft than most, almost to the extent that one gets the feeling Edmands didnt entirely trust his own images.
  Negative
He ought to have.
  Neutral
Bluebird can be a tough film to watch given that this reviewer lives in New York, which has been undergoing a frigid snap like nobodys business, and has also been to a hospital every day for a week visiting a relative who is recovering well, no worries, it is not the sort of thing Id actually be inclined to sit through left to my own devices at the moment but it is a distinctive one, and the director is worth your attention.
  Positive
