Roman J. Israel, Esq. looks like prime Oscar bait.
  Positive
It has the glow of nobility and importance emanating from every frame courtesy of  Robert Elswits cinematography.
  Very positive
The screenplay by writer-director  Dan Gilroy is filled with dialogue about civil rights, the prison industrial complex and the common man.
  Negative
And its lead actors famous good looks have gone AWOL so he may enroll in the Academy voters favorite class, Frumpy .
  Positive
But dont be fooled!
  Negative
This is not Oscar bait at all.
  Negative
Roman J. Israel, Esq. is the kind of horrendous hot mess an actor makes directly after he wins the Oscar.
  Negative
Granted,  Denzel Washington didnt win the golden statuette he deserved last year, but if he had, it might have justified why he chose this lifeless story as his follow-up.
  Negative
My best guess is that Denzel wanted to cosplay as  Eddie Murphys Norbit.
  Positive
He would have made a far better Randy Watson from Coming to America, if you ask me.
  Negative
But I digress.
  Positive
The version of Roman J. Israel, Esq. hitting theaters this week is not the same one that drew critical scorn at the Toronto Film Festival.
  Negative
The new cut is  minutes shorter and certain plot points have been edited in a different order.
  Positive
Theres some vague notion that a major revealspoiler has been moved to an earlier spot in the film.
  Negative
Gilroys story makes so little narrative sense that I have no idea what theyre talking about, so I am issuing a spoiler warning from here on as a precautionary measure.
  Very negative
Roman is a lawyer in a two-man criminal defense law firm in Los Angeles.
  Neutral
He and his boss, William Jackson, handle cases for the downtrodden and underprivileged.
  Positive
William is the public face of the firm, arguing in court and meeting with clients.
  Positive
Roman does all the research and advises on how to approach each case.
  Neutral
Its hinted that Roman has some form of Aspergers, though his Rain Man-like recollection of the number of every single statute leans him more heavily into savant territory.
  Neutral
It is also hinted that Romans lack of social cue recognition may have been the reason William never sent him to court.
  Negative
Of course, as Roman J. Israel, Esq. opens, William has suffered a soon-to-be-fatal heart attack and Roman has to cover for him in court.
  Negative
Before we see Roman in action, however, were treated to voiceover by Washington that is meant to set up a flashback structure.
  Negative
The narration accompanies a legal brief Roman is writing.
  Negative
The brief is two paragraphs of legalese interspersed with nonsense, and we get to see it typed in its entirety on the screen.
  Negative
As letters fill the screen, the score gets louder and more bombastic in a vain attempt to telegraph suspense.
  Negative
In the brief, Roman calls himself a hypocrite who has sold out his own belief system.
  Neutral
He casts himself as plaintiff and defendant in this damning confession.
  Negative
Eventually, well return to this brief, but for now, were thrown three weeks into the past where Roman makes his first court appearance in decades.
  Negative
Despite being told by Williams assistant to simply ask for continuances, Roman engages the case.
  Neutral
His client is getting a raw deal, to be sure, but Roman exacerbates the situation by arguing with the judge until he is held in contempt.
  Negative
Later, Roman will again go against his firms wishes by telling off the district attorney in regards to a plea offer.
  Neutral
Both of these scenes are played for laughs in the films trailer, but neither scene is so damn funny in context: that contempt charge gets Williams near-bankrupt firm slapped with a , fine' the district attorney flap indirectly results in a clients murder.
  Neutral
Its clear that Washington and Gilroy want to cast Roman as some kind of grumpy genius hes the Dr. House of lawyers.
  Positive
The problem is that, unlike Dr. House, Roman is horrible at his job.
  Negative
You would not want this man representing you, nor would you want him, as Maya  Carmen Ejogo discovers, to come speak at your activism meeting.
  Negative
Since Williams firm was known for its community service, Maya hopes Roman can inspire her group.
  Negative
But Romans ideas about women are as outdated as his clothing.
  Negative
This too is played for laughs in the trailer' in the film, the scene ends with an angry activist leveling the F-word at a confused Roman, turning this important meeting into chaos.
  Negative
The film's romantic interest Maya has the thankless job of echoing how great and inspiring Roman is supposed to be.
  Positive
Shes necessary because we never see a single thing to support why wed care about Roman or his story.
  Negative
On a dinner date, Maya is so overwhelmed with admiration for Roman that she bursts into tears, and while Ejogo convincingly weeps, I couldnt help but ask myself why?
  Positive
Youll be asking yourself why a lot too, as this lifeless, interminable movie plays as if the filmmakers threw the footage up in the air and edited it in the order it hit the floor.
  Negative
Why, for example, does Roman do what I think is that aforementioned major revealspoiler?
  Negative
Ill tread lightly here.
  Neutral
Roman suddenly decides to accept money from a shady source, a breach of ethics that comes out of nowhere and is characteristically abnormal.
  Neutral
Roman uses that money to bring his wardrobe up to the st century, to move into a swanky apartment and to tighten up his coif.
  Neutral
He does not need the money, as hes been hired by the offices of rich lawyer George Pierce  Colin Farrell, the man whom the now-deceased William had selected to dissolve Romans firm.
  Negative
Romans actions may or may not be the hypocrisy he referred to in his damning brief, yet one wonders why he couldnt have just used his salary for his adventure rather than dirty money.
  Negative
His actions are inexplicable and serve only to give the film the tragic ending it neither earns nor deserves.
  Negative
Roman J. Israel, Esq. is rather insulting to folks like me who are on the spectrum.
  Negative
Washington gives one of his rare bad performances here, turning Roman into an improv sketch filled with tics, mannerisms and an overreliance on his attire.
  Negative
Hes never a real person, even when hes having a paranoid episode or, in a fit of terror, trying to outrun a sports car in a U-Haul truck.
  Negative
The most memorable thing about him is his Eddie Kendricks ringtone, which plays Keep on Truckin whenever his flip phone lights up.
  Negative
The film is also insulting in how it treats Romans pet activism project.
  Negative
Throughout the film, Roman obsesses over the contents of the case he always drags with him in an attach.
  Negative
Its a controversial brief designed to change the way people of color are treated by the courts.
  Negative
We do not learn anything about this potentially fascinating court filing, nor do we spend enough time with the people who inspired Romans obsession.
  Negative
Plus, the films ending implies that Roman could only achieve his goal through a brutal sacrifice and a helpful White savior whos jarred into action only when the dead Black body is someone he cares about.
  Negative
As the Spinners classic Ill Be Around played over the closing credits, all I could do was ask myself why?
  Negative
