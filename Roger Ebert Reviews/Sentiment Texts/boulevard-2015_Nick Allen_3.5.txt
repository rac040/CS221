In Boulevard, the late  Robin Williams plays a man with a secret.
  Neutral
His character, Nolan, has muted this piece of his life for over a half-century, as assisted by suburban monotony and a peaceful marriage.
  Negative
His cubicle at the bank boxes him in during the day.
  Neutral
At night, his wife  Kathy Baker has a peaceful distance from his personal life, as they sleep in separate bedrooms.
  Negative
Even his best friend, Winston  Bob Odenkirk, seems to be a good one, but not someone that pays close enough attention to truly understand his friend's life.
  Positive
"Boulevard" is a movie about choosing truth, regardless of how many years may have been lost to a lie.
  Positive
The catalyst for Nolan's choice is his father's cardiac arrest.
  Negative
After leaving the hospital, Nolan drives down a shadier street of town, and picks up a young male prostitute named Leo  Roberto Aguire.
  Negative
They go to a motel, but Nolan isn't paying for anything sexual' he just wants to talk, to interact with someone that might listen.
  Negative
The two continue to see each other, of which Nolan is insistent upon paying for his time.
  Positive
Nolan isnt clear about his intentions, which alarms Leo, but he isnt malicious about them.
  Neutral
Talking to Leo makes Nolan happy, as does the idea of taking care of him.
  Positive
Nolan wants a true connection with a human being.
  Positive
As Nolan spends more time sneaking out to see Leo, the charade of his public life begins to unravel.
  Negative
Williams and director  Dito Montiel are in tune with a pervading sense of tenderness, as the movie distinctly ruminates on connection, not love.
  Positive
Writer  Douglas Soesbe does something that's nothing short of miraculous with the presentation of its secret, by stripping it of its sensationalism, and showing how big a deal it is despite the smallness of Nolan's character.
  Positive
The dialogue within Nolan's moments of accepting himself provides for revelatory scenes, especially the spacious conversation between him and his wife, as she expresses her awareness of the situation, but her own resistance to see it change.
  Positive
Montiel's usual dramatic instincts, to go big and brash, are aptly muffled for the most part, except for the couple moments of false intensity involving Leo's abusive pimp Eddie  Giles Matthey.
  Negative
With dramatic scripts, Williams was a hushed force that offered something painfully human, and a talent who would go to the darkest depths with directors who had the right story ex.
  Negative
Bobcat Goldthwaits " World's Greatest Dad," the definitive Williams role in the s.
  Positive
The ingredient he brings most to "Boulevard" is heartfelt empathy, which makes this portrayal heroic.
  Very positive
In such a peaceful performance, Williams achieves layers with muted expressions of angst or defeat, and a confident stillness.
  Positive
In his everyman presence, which he achieves before even stepping into the movie's generic suburban setting, Williams is as gentle as he is compassionate for those who live with their secrets daily.
  Positive
Just like with his rambunctious comedy, he plays this character as an accomplished entertainer with nothing to lose.
  Negative
"Boulevard" is not just the transformation of Nolan, but that of a director.
  Negative
Montiel successfully removes himself from the NYC roots he has reflected upon so often in his films that star male aggression, and he now takes to nondescript suburbs, with an entirely internal character.
  Positive
A display of his potential with bare bone filmmaking elements, along with his able to diversify the energy within his films, Boulevard proves a personal success.
  Positive
The end of the film, which is uncharacteristically upbeat, is tough.
  Positive
Regardless as to how much one may like the movie, its a bittersweet conclusion.
  Positive
Boulevard has the unfortunate mark in history as being the last on-screen appearance for Williams, and it provides the ending to his on-screen life that tragically doesnt parallel that of his off-screen one.
  Negative
His soulful work here leaves his career feeling very incomplete' for a few more misguided film choices that he might have made, as popular entertainers always do, there would also be some very special performance vehicles, as with "Boulevard."
  Positive
And they wouldnt have just displayed proof of his timeless, humble grandeur.
  Positive
They could have done some good for us, too.
