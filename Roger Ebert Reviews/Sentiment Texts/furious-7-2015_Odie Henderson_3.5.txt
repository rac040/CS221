Furious  is a glorious overcompensation, a film so concerned about its rampant machismo that the casual viewer might miss how it Tokyo-drifts atop soap opera bubbles.
  Positive
Like Lee Daniels' hit TV drama  Empire, Furious  is stuffed with situations that require go-for-broke absurdity, but even Daniels and his nighttime soap predecessor  Aaron Spelling would pause before attempting the level of get the f k outta here!
  Negative
style shenanigans director  James Wan and writer  Chris Morgan employ.
  Positive
Standing atop this installment of the series is its own Cookie Lyon, Dominic Toretto  Vin Diesel.
  Negative
Like Cookie, played by  Taraji P. Henson on Empire, Toretto will protect those he loves at any cost.
  Positive
He spends the entire film seeking revenge.
  Neutral
Those unfamiliar with the franchise will be left to their own devices as to why.
  Negative
Theres no last time on the Fast and the Furious recap to get you up to speed, and one shouldnt expect it from a movie with "" in its title.
  Negative
Viewers of Fast and Furious  will know that the Tokyo-set demise of Han  Sung Kang, one of the main characters, sets this new installments plot in motion.
  Negative
After a package mailed from Tokyo nearly blows Toretto and his comrade-in-arms Brian  Paul Walker to smithereens, Toretto senses a connection and is immediately out for blood.
  Negative
The bomb, and Hans death, are courtesy of Deckard Shaw  Jason Statham, an Englishman whose first stateside order of business is to hack the computer of Luke Hobbs Dwayne  The Rock Johnson to find Toretto and his cohorts.
  Very negative
Hobbs has this information because last time on " The Fast and the Furious" Hobbs DSS agent practically blackmailed Toretto and company to help him take down a mercenary organization run by Deckard Shaws brother, Owen  Luke Evans.
  Negative
In exchange for succeeding at this job and killing Owen, Hobbs cleared the criminal records the Toretto Team acquired two movies ago.
  Negative
For having this information, Hobbs is severely injured by Deckard in one of Furious s numerous fight sequences.
  Negative
Toretto reassembles his crew, which includes Brian, IT guy Tej Chris Ludacris Bridges, smooth-talker Roman Tyrese and Dominics partner, Letty  Michelle Rodriguez.
  Negative
Letty has amnesia because,previously on "The Fast and The Furious," she got blown up and was presumed dead.
  Negative
Though she has no memory of her former romantic life with Dominic, he holds out hope shell regain her memory.
  Negative
The biggest catfights in the movie arent between  Ronda Rousey and Michelle Rodriguez, theyre between the two men.
  Negative
Deckard somehow manages to appear wherever Toretto is, demanding retribution and throwing monkey wrenches into Torettos plans.
  Negative
The two constantly crash their cars into each other, then crawl out of the wreckage to brawl with pipes, fists and feet.
  Negative
Its hilarious, as if Deckard has a tracking device on Toretto and is stalking him like a scorned lover.
  Positive
Speaking of tracking devices, Furious  not only has one, its the most powerful spy device in film history.
  Positive
Currently in the hands of Jakonde  Djimon Hounsou, it uses surveillance cameras, cell phones and other eyes in the sky to track anybody.
  Positive
Torettos team is hired to retrieve it so they can track Deckard, though as Toretto correctly notes, I could just stand here and wait for him to find me.
  Negative
If he had, old people like me wouldnt be blessed with an appearance by Snake Plissken himself,  Kurt Russell.
  Negative
Russells Mr. Nobody provides information and the use of the device should Toretto retrieve it.
  Positive
He's a classic Kurt Russell character, and as the Gershwins once queried, who could ask for anything more?
  Positive
He steals the film simply by putting on night vision sunglasses.
  Positive
The tracking device comes with a gorgeous programmer named Ramsey  Nathalie Emmanuel and enough enemies to populate a final battle that basically levels Los Angeles.
  Positive
Amidst all this carnage, Furious  finds time for drool-worthy car porn and so many shots of bikini-clad females that it feels like a Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker parody of Baby Got Back.
  Negative
Even Ramsey gets a gratuitous ogling by the camera that is, when its not licking car metal and panting over its willful destruction.
  Negative
I havent scratched the surface of the plot.
  Negative
Not that it matters, though, as the film's primary concern is putting its viewers through an action-packed wringer.
  Positive
Wan, whose hyper camera tricks have annoyed me in movies like  Insidious,  The Conjuring and  Saw, has finally found the right project to match his style.
  Neutral
The fight sequences have the usual sped-up kinetics, but Wan frames them so theyre not hard to follow.
  Negative
The car scenes are equally proficient.
  Neutral
And the films midsection, which piles action sequence upon action sequence, is the most riveting and exciting set piece Ive seen in years.
  Positive
It pulses with adrenaline and a visual humor to match the comic camaraderie of its characters.
  Very positive
The actors, whose appearances span several entries in the series, have a character-driven, lived-in comfort with one another: They are all believable as the "family" Toretto refers to in that cheesy line from the commercial.
  Positive
This is an immensely entertaining movie, and if the filmmakers are wise, theyll quit on this high note.
  Positive
One final thing: Furious  ends with a wonderful tribute to Paul Walker, the actor who was killed in a car accident in the middle of filming this movie.
  Positive
Before a montage of his appearances in the series, theres a callback to the first film and some tender dialogue between Diesel and Walker.
  Negative
Wans camera then catches an overhead shot of a highway dividing.
  Negative
As Diesel narrates, we see the two leads cars go in different directions, like a visual representation of  Robert Frosts The Road Not Taken.
  Negative
Since Walker appeared in six of the seven films, he is the series equivalent of the North Star.
  Negative
Future installments will find that fixed mark of the Northern Hemispheres upward gaze missing from its sky.
  Negative
So this tribute is very emotional for fans of both the series and the actor, because its as if the fictional Furious  knows that you know that Walker is gone.
  Positive
And yet, I must admit there are moments in the film where this knowledge makes for uncomfortable viewing.
  Negative
Some of the more vicious car crashes and explosions are uneasy reminders, and while the film is careful not to evoke any parallels in scenes with Walker, his untimely death was never far from my mind.
  Negative
This is not a criticism' as I said, the tribute is wonderful, and the movie is a lot of fun.
  Positive
It's just an acknowledgment that I sometimes felt guilty for enjoying the car chases so much.
  Negative
Your mileage may vary.
  Neutral
