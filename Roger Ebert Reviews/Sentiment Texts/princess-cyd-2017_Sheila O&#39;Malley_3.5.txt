An extended scene about halfway through  Stephen Cone's "Princess Cyd" is a perfect illustration of what he does so well as a director.
  Positive
A group of friends gather twice a month to eat, drink, and read excerpts of literature to one another.
  Positive
Everyone comes with something prepared.
  Positive
One person reads the famous final pages of James Joyce's The Dead.
  Neutral
An old woman reads Emily Dickinson's poem starting with the line "There's a certain Slant of light."
  Positive
Excerpts from  James Baldwin, Thoreau ... In the room is a palpable space of intent group focus, the scene perfectly evoking the pleasure of the ritual for everyone involved.
  Positive
Cone captures the atmosphere of groups, and groups in particular contexts, the fluctuating alchemy of messy collectives.
  Negative
His gift with ensembles puts him in rare company with directors like  Jonathan Demme and  Jean Renoir, directors comfortable with sprawl, "mess", letting things develop as they come.
  Negative
Cone treats each moment with patience stepping back, allowing it to breathe, find itself.
  Negative
The actors in his films not just in "Princess Cyd" but his previous features " The Wise Kids" and " Henry Gamble's Birthday Party" make us believe these people have known one another forever.
  Positive
Whereas in "The Wise Kids" and "Henry Gamble," the ensemble is the star, "Princess Cyd" features a main character as the focal point, a strong, freckled, teenage girl named Cyd short for Cydney, who goes to stay with her aunt Miranda  Rebecca Spence for three weeks.
  Negative
Miranda, a famous author, still lives in the Chicago home where she and her sister Cyd's mother, now dead grew up.
  Negative
Why Miranda hasn't been a part of Cyd's life at all isn't revealed until near the end of the film, but it's a a buzzing subtext.
  Negative
Teenagers are often shoehorned into types by lazy screenwriters, unimaginative directors, etc.
  Negative
It's easier, I guess, to use shorthand: jock  jerk, pretty girl  mean, bookworm  nerd.
  Negative
Cyd, though, is a mixed bag.
  Neutral
She plays soccer at school, she is unselfconscious about her body, she's curious about some things, totally indifferent about others.
  Negative
"I don't read," she informs her literary aunt, who struggles to maintain a neutral expression in the face of such a shocking admission.
  Neutral
Cyd is not neurotic about what she wants witness her behavior at the tail-end of the literary reading party, but there's a blankness there somewhere, a lack of continuity with her past, dating from her mother's death.
  Negative
She barges into the carefully constructed world of her more reserved aunt, asking abrupt questions, sometimes as a rude interruption.
  Negative
Miranda fields Cyd's bull-in-a-china-shop questions gamely, but it's awkward.
  Negative
How on earth is she supposed to relate to this bouncing blonde athlete who isn't even embarrassed that she doesn't read?
  Negative
On the first day of Cyd's visit, she goes into a coffee shop and makes eye contact with an androgynous fluffy-Mohawked barista named Katie  Malic White.
  Negative
Whatever Cyd sees goes to her core, there's a pheromonal chemistry-click, seemingly reciprocal.
  Negative
Cyd has a boyfriend back home, but is blase about it when he's mentioned.
  Negative
With Katie, though, the confident Cyd disintegrates into a helpless girl with a crush.
  Neutral
The two start hanging out, and it's clearly the beginning stages of a courtship.
  Positive
Cone treads lightly here.
  Negative
He is interested in the feelingof things, the impressionistic aspect of love and attraction: hair and sunlight and laughter, the vertigo of butterflies in the stomach.
  Positive
His style is gentle and unobtrusive.
  Positive
Cyd hasn't been with a girl before, but she doesn't question her attraction.
  Negative
One of the things "Princess Cyd" does really well is gently allow for the space that opens up between people and in that space everything is okay.
  Positive
Love isn't just neurosis.
  Neutral
Love is also comfort and belonging.
  Neutral
Cyd doesn't need to change herself to be "worthy" of anyone.
  Negative
Maybe this space between people the same space in the group literary-reading scene is love.
  Positive
Letting others contribute to you, listening to others, not just focusing on what you will say next.
  Positive
Perhaps to those more accustomed to the peaks and valleys of plotconflictclimax, "Princess Cyd" will seem too leisurely.
  Negative
But its leisurely quality its disinterest in "pumping" things up, its focus on the small yet vivid spaces of listening, understanding, struggle, identity is its greatest asset.
  Positive
The scenes between Cyd and Miranda play out on a parallel track to Cyd and Katie's relationship.
  Negative
The aunt-niece dynamic very well could have followed the cliched rule book: Boisterous Cyd teaches repressed Miranda to loosen up, and bookworm Miranda teaches Cyd to appreciate the written word!
  Negative
While some of these elements do show up, Cone resits putting the characters into a simplistic dialectic.
  Negative
Neither needs to become more like the other in order to be a "well-rounded" person.
  Neutral
"Well-rounded" people don't make interesting dramatic characters anyway.
  Negative
For Cone, no one point of view is prioritized.
  Negative
This was what was so amazing about "Henry Gamble's Birthday Party," featuring a much larger ensemble.
  Positive
Miranda wrestles with her reactions to some of Cyd's behavior and there's one extraordinary scene where she calls her niece out for making a rude comment.
  Positive
This is a woman whose wifi password is "Hawthorne"  being the year of the publication of " The Scarlet Letter".
  Negative
Writing Miranda off as a spinster who needs to get laid is deeply disrespectful, and Miranda asserts her own equally valid Self in reaction.
  Negative
There are all kinds of ways to find pleasure in life.
  Positive
Sex is only one of them.
  Neutral
You don't realize how positional most films are, how they push audiences to think a certain way about charactersstoryconflict, until you see a film like "Princess Cyd," until you see how Cone presents his characters and then steps back, allowing them to work it out for themselves.
  Negative
There are conflicts in "Princess Cyd," but they're on a low boil.
  Negative
One of the pluses of Cone's approach if you're open to it is you are sometimes confronted with your own preconceived notions about people.
  Negative
You may look at Miranda, and think immediately, "Oh, okay, I know who that woman is."
  Negative
You would be wrong.
  Negative
The same for Cyd.
  Neutral
"Oh, okay.
  Positive
Bored teenager sunbathing in a bikini.
  Neutral
I know who that is."
  Neutral
Again, you would be wrong.
  Neutral
There's a great line in Philip Barry's "Philadelphia Story", where Tracy Lord, who has lived her life in imperious judgment of others, finally "gets it," and says to her cynical friend: "The time to make up your mind about people ... is never."
  Positive
What a concept.
  Neutral
It's not easy, what Stephen Cone does.
  Negative
If it were easy, we'd see it more often.
  Positive
