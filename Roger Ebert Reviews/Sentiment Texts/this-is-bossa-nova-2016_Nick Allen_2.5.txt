By the end of the very musically-inclined documentary This Is Bossa Nova which withholds the image of someone playing guitar by the sunset for the last five minutes its title proves to be more than just descriptive.
  Negative
In one sense, it is frank, a la now, THIS, ladies and gentlemen, is bossa nova.
  Negative
But for a documentary that encompasses all major players, tunes, and movements of the genre, it is also justifiably encyclopedic.
  Negative
Director  Paulo Thiagos film Coisa Mais Linda: Histrias e Casos da Bossa Nova also has the subtitle of The Histories and Stories, a generalization it takes rather seriously when providing all contexts to the ballad samba spin-off sub genre, often of a laid-back yet rhythmic, jazz-chord-driven romance.
  Negative
Featuring an array of talking heads from people directly involved in the scene that started in the late s, Thiago notes on the different places, faces, ideas even different guitar plucking methods behind bossa nova as a Brazilian cultural phenomenon and everlasting genre of gorgeous musical expression.
  Negative
Although the likes of arguably the biggest names like singer  Joo Gilberto and composer Antnio Carlos Jobim are not in the film one is a known recluse, the other passed away in , respectively, the documentary feels to capture the genres headspace and the scene.
  Negative
Performances are used as extended footnotes for mentioned song titles, sometimes performed by the people who did them originally as with talents like Wanda Sa, or Johnny Alf.
  Negative
In simply-orchestrated passages where genre fixtures like  Carlos Lyra and Roberto Menescal just happen to be openly reminiscing about their genres past, the storytelling is appropriately acoustic.
  Negative
A key dash of musical romance involves Menescal recounting his first meeting with bossa nova, standing in an apartment and talking to us as hes giving a tour through a memory.
  Negative
The camera then follows him out onto the apartments balcony, where two notable men from the genre are in the corner playing Sente' with no special effects needed for this flashback, Menescal completes the reenactment by standing back, listening.
  Negative
The documentary really picks up about  minutes in when it focuses on Gilberto and Jobim, whose professional success gives opportunity for unique footage of bossa nova performances.
  Negative
A particular gem involves Gerry Mulligan riffing with Jobim in New York City, trying to program his American jazz sensibilities different rhythms required of the bossa nova form.
  Negative
Another involves  Frank Sinatra playing The Girl from Ipanema a bossa nova greatest hit, opposite Jobim himself, from an album they recorded together in the  Francis Albert Sinatra amp' Antnio Carlos Jobim.
  Negative
This Is Bossa Nova is unfortunately more concerned with pleasure of sound over sight, with numerous moments in which its visual sense can fall out of tune.
  Negative
Subtitles can be sloppy and are rarely offered for songs, historical photos are shuffled around without any personality, and the formats change from a sharp digital image to fuzzy video.
  Negative
The most stable aesthetic might come from the documentarys commitment to musicianship, giving close-ups to smooth hands during busy chord progressions, or sometimes allowing one guitar and one voice to fill a room in a delicate medium shot.
  Negative
The overall length of This is Bossa Nova would be a problem too if the effect of bossa nova werent so pertinent Thiagos film is a delightful showcase of gentle protagonists and their intricate yet seemingly breathless harmonies.
  Negative
It captures bossa nova as a movement that lives on decades later in its legends, and shares that warmth in bundles.
  Positive
At the very least, its a musical genre well worth diving into, or even better, listening to for two straight hours.
