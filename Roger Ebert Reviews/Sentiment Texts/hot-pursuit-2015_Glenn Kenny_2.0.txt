As a movie, Hot Pursuit can barely be said to exist.
  Negative
It is slackly constructed, unattractively shot, indifferently edited' its action scenes are very poorly staged' its storyline a kind of hybrid of  The Gauntlet and  Thelma and Louise with scraps from several very lesser movies thrown in  Due Date, anyone?
  Very negative
is so rote that it even seems bored with itself.
  Negative
But as a delivery system for a newly minted and reasonably engaging if not always laugh-out-loud comedy team  Reese Witherspoon and Sophie Vergara Hot Pursuit works, arguably, as well as it has to for much of its brisk hour-and-a-half.
  Positive
In other words, if you key in to the often manic comic chemistry that Witherspoon and Vergara spark off, you wont mind, for instance, the Im-almost-certain-inadvertently-funny ineptitude of the take-down-the-bad-guy is that a spoiler?
  Negative
Is that possible for a movie like this?
  Neutral
wont bother you all that much.
  Negative
And youll also deserve congratulation, I suppose for being a very easygoing movie viewer.
  Negative
In any event: here Witherspoon plays Cooper the fact that nobody ever refers to her by her first name is kind of a character point a perky and ultra by-the-book goody-two-shoes cop who gets what she thinks is a dream assignment when shes told to escort a witness in a drug-lord case to her Grand Jury appointment.
  Negative
That witness is Vergaras Daniella, whos very Vergara: brash, blinged-out, super confident and a potential fount of English-language malapropism, although the film doesnt, for better or worse, exploit that last bit of comic potential much.
  Very negative
Rather, after a scene in which both another witness and a bonafide Federal Marshall are killed youll notice that by opening with a double murder, you get the comic tone set and fixed right there Witherspoon and Vergaras characters spend a lot of energy and time insulting each others personal appearances, pausing only to outwit the bad guys who wanna kill them via an outpouring of guilt power.
  Negative
The funniest bit is the most biologically graphic, in which the duo convince their potential assassins to grant them a bathroom break by describing human female menstruation in detail to the grossed-out Evil Bros.
  Positive
Powerful Sisterhood, however, consistently eludes Cooper and Daniella, as the scripts too-busy and eventually utterly beside-the-point plot twists compel Vergaras redeemable Bad Girl to keep stabbing Cooper in the back.
  Negative
Okay, maybe thats too strong.
  Negative
More like she kicks her in the shins and runs.
  Negative
Literally.
  Neutral
And over and over again.
  Neutral
The energy, commitment, and good will displayed by the lead performers is pretty much the movies only redeeming quality.
  Very positive
Ive seen one critic compare their interaction to that of  Bob Hope and Bing Crosby, old-school comic performers who starred in a series of Road movies back in the day.
  Positive
Those films were not terribly substantial, but at least their makers had some sense of story carpentry, even when the story served no purpose except to let the top dogs riff.
  Negative
They would not, for instance, kick off the action of their scenarios with a scene of a cop getting murdered.
  Negative
Theyd find another way to get their characters into a fix.
  Negative
Im not saying this because I found the set up of Hot Pursuit to be actually offensive.
  Negative
Just lazy.
  Negative
Really, really lazy.
