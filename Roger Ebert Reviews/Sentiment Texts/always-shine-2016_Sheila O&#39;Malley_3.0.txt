Director  Sophia Takal is interested in the murky powerful undertows beneath female friendship, the dark sides of supposed safe spaces and just how threatening close female friendship is to whatever status quo that might exist.
  Negative
The two films so far from this confident young filmmaker, Green  and her latest, Always Shine which, in many ways, is an unofficial sequel of Green, in terms of Takals exploration of these loaded topics, are deeply unnerving.
  Positive
The atmosphere of menace seems to emerge from the landscape itself or directly from the characters' psyches.
  Negative
The "pathetic fallacy" is omnipresent and stifling.
  Negative
"Always Shine," written by  Lawrence Michael Levine who appears in both Green and Always Shine moves explicitly into a horror film realm, but the real engine of the film as it was in Green is the relationship between the two women at its center.
  Negative
Two -something actresses, Beth  Caitlin FitzGerald and Anna  Mackenzie Davis, take a weekend road trip to the isolated Big Sur home of Annas aunt.
  Negative
Beths career has started to gain a kind of momentum.
  Neutral
Yes, she is always cast as the obligatory naked blonde in horror movies, but still, she's getting paid to do what she loves.
  Negative
Anna, on the other hand, seethes with jealousy.
  Positive
Anna has more ambition than Beth.
  Positive
Anna is a better actress than Beth they both acknowledge that.
  Neutral
But Beth is softly agreeable and girlishly pretty with a submissive voice and manner.
  Negative
Anna is off-puttingly emotional, easily hurt and smears on bright red lipstick like a warning flag, rather than a seduction.
  Negative
They are both blonde and slim, and there are multiple shots of each, seen from behind, and you cant tell them apart.
  Positive
This intensifies Annas hurt: Theyre similar "types."
  Negative
Why Beth and not her?
  Neutral
Especially when she wants it more?
  Neutral
This is a film about acting, as the trompe loeil opening sequence makes clear.
  Positive
The sequence shows what appears to be two auditions, with the actresses reciting lines staring into the camera, as off-camera male voices speak to them.
  Negative
But these scenes lead the audience astray before doubling back to provide delayed clarity all the more satisfying because of the delay.
  Positive
Nothing is what it seems.
  Negative
Thats show biz, first of all, and these girls have devoted their lives to illusion and performance.
  Negative
On the other hand, things are exactly what they appear to be, and the brain resists what is plain as day, perceiving illusion where there is none.
  Negative
Always Shine is a persona-swap movie, clearly influenced by  Persona and  Mulholland Drive, two other films featuring actresses who experience a dangerous and disorienting merging, boundaries obliterated, the quest for identity totally irrelevant in the world of theatre, where you the person are supposed to disappear anyway.
  Very negative
Despite the tension that is there from the get-go, Beth and Anna take hikes, go out for a drink at a nearby bar, hang out on the deck.
  Negative
The dynamic is jagged and unpredictable.
  Negative
Anna seems downright unstable.
  Negative
Beth is intimidated by Anna and its not hard to understand why.
  Negative
Anna takes Beths success as a personal affront.
  Positive
Not only that, but the fact that Beth doesnt share good news she's included in the Young Hollywood issue of a magazine, she's been offered the lead in a new movie, a step up is seen as treachery by Anna.
  Negative
Annas outrage that Beth would ever dare complain about anything completely silences Beth.
  Negative
To complicate matters, Beth is not blameless, although she operates in a miasma of plausible deniability.
  Negative
Beth engages in subtle moments of sabotage throughout.
  Positive
In one painful scene, Beth co-opts the attention of a guy Anna seems interested in and does so in a way that is impossible to clock.
  Negative
Anna is not wrong about Beth.
  Negative
This is such an accurate observation about what can happen between actresses when one of them starts to pull ahead.
  Positive
Oscar Wilde, in his essay The Soul of Man Under Socialism, expressed it perfectly: Anyone can sympathise with the sufferings of a friend, but it requires a very fine nature it requires, in fact, the nature of a true Individualist to sympathise with a friends success.
  Positive
Cinematographer  Mark Schwartzbard makes the majestic Big Sur landscape seem like an emanation from the emotions of the women: Waves crash against the rocks, thick fog rolls in, trees stand like sentinels.
  Negative
There are specific choices that work beautifully, like the camera following Beth as she paces on the deck in an increasingly frenzied manner.
  Positive
There's one great shot where the two women turn into three: Anna, alone onscreen, back to the camera, stares into a mirror.
  Positive
In the mirror is a reflection of her face, as well as a reflection of Beth's face, off-camera, but still present in the background.
  Positive
Editor  Zach Clark whose directorial effort " Little Sister" was one of the pleasures of this fall intercuts the action with brief glimpses of violence, so brief you can't tell what's happening, figures, darkness, movement, accompanied by screams, cut short.
  Negative
"Always Shine" is not a mumblecore kitchen-sink-reality film.
  Negative
It's highly stylized.
  Positive
Some of the stylistic choices work better than others.
  Positive
The horror tropes are familiar, bordering on cliche.
  Negative
What is truly terrifying is the cataclysm opening up between the women, the volatility of their dynamic.
  Positive
None of this would be possible without the extraordinary performances of these two actresses.
  Negative
Mackenzie Davis gives a star-making performance.
  Positive
A maelstrom of emotions churn all over her expressive face: sharp anger, wounded hurt and baffled confusion.
  Negative
This is a woman who needs more space to maneuver, who needs to live in a world that lets her be, lets her be as loud, as passionate, as emotional as she is.
  Negative
It's how she's wired, and it's devastating that nobody wants it not men, not casting directors, not Beth, not anyone.
  Negative
Caitlin FitzGerald portrays a woman whose submissiveness is habitual and learned.
  Neutral
But when her anger starts to bubble up, when she finally has had enough of being Anna's punching bag, you see that Anna has perhaps underestimated her friend all along.
  Positive
Always Shine is an immersive nightmare of merging, over-identification, and projection.
  Negative
Its strangeness and I yearned for more strangeness is part of the fascination.
  Positive
The true horror here is emotional.
  Neutral
These women feel pressure to be one and have an equal desire to shatter the illusion of one-ness forever.
  Negative
