"You have to break a dog to break their will."
  Neutral
"What is a 'will,' exactly, anyway?"
  Neutral
"It's character.
  Positive
It's the thing that makes you you."
  Neutral
If the "will" is the "thing that makes you you," then breaking that will is tyrannical.
  Positive
Maybe a broken will is necessary to the social contract, as well as a part of the human condition, but there's hardly any comfort in that.
  Negative
Todd Solondz doesn't care about the audience's comfort and his films have a ruthless, unblinking stare, almost refreshing in their uncompromising attitude especially in comparison with the industry's pathological desire for happy endings.
  Positive
Solondz rarely provides escape hatches.
  Neutral
He presents reality, or reality as he sees it.
  Negative
Reality can be hilarious, absurd, touching.
  Positive
It can also be an exercise in futility.
  Neutral
With all its humor and there is a ton, "Wiener-Dog," following the journey of a dachshund as it is shuffled from owner to owner, is one of Solondz's sharpest visions of futility.
  Negative
Early on, there is a slow horizontal pan down a line of caged dogs, lit in the sickly-green of buzzing fluorescence.
  Negative
It is surreal and elegant, putting us into the world-view of the creature we will follow.
  Positive
Disorientation is almost total for the dog.
  Negative
Just a moment ago, the dog knew where it was, who its "person" was.
  Negative
Everything changed in an instant.
  Neutral
Each owner of the dog is further along down life's path, and the dog is the witness to the passage of time.
  Negative
The owners flail in the void, searching for a handhold,  something to make life meaningful.
  Negative
Shot by  Edward Lachman, two-time Oscar nominee for "Far From Heaven" and " Carol", "Wiener-Dog" enters and exits multiple worlds, following the dog's destiny.
  Negative
It starts in an ultra-cool modern house with no personal objects in sight, not even in the child's room.
  Negative
Remi  Keaton Nigel Cooke, a little boy with constantly bickering parents  Tracy Letts and  Julie Delpy is given the dog to comfort him after a serious illness.
  Negative
Neither parent is happy with this situation.
  Positive
Dad is shown trying to train the dog, throwing vicious epithets its way.
  Negative
But Remi falls in love with the dog, naming it "Wiener-Dog" the nickname of poor Dawn Wiener in Solondz's "Welcome to the Dollhouse".
  Negative
When the dog gets spayed, Remi is concerned that she will be scared and in pain' when the dog gets sick, Remi asks questions about death.
  Negative
Delpy handles her son's anxieties in a mildly panicked and yet totally inappropriate way.
  Negative
"We don't believe in God," she tells her son.
  Negative
"Nature doesn't care about animals," she informs Remi.
  Negative
She relates the sad story of Croissant, her childhood dog who got pregnant only she describes it as Croissant having been "raped by a dog named Mohammad".
  Neutral
Remi's love of his dog, and the rapturous scene where the two tear apart the living room in slo-mo, is an ecstatic moment of uncomplicated joy and freedom, the best that dogs and children can exemplify.
  Very positive
The next owner is Dawn Wiener all grown up from "Welcome to the Dollhouse" and now played by  Greta Gerwig.
  Negative
Dawn rescues the dog who is about to be put to sleep from a vet's office, cradling it in her arms.
  Negative
At a convenience store, she runs into Brandon, the boy she knew when she was a kid played by Brendan Sexton in "Welcome to the Dollhouse" and here played by  Kieran Culkin, and they have a stilted reunion where it's clear that he can't wait to get away from her.
  Negative
When he tells her that she looks like her dog, her face lights up.
  Neutral
Dawn is cheery, pliable, caring, and susceptible.
  Very positive
Brandon is on his way somewhere, and she decides to come along with her dog, and suddenly "Wiener-Dog" becomes a road movie.
  Positive
There's a detached quality to Dawn she sits on her bed, staring out the window, saying to herself simply: "I miss nothing here."
  Negative
A person with no attachments, she floats, and Greta Gerwig is a great "floater."
  Positive
Dawn is like Remi in that she sees the pain in others in the bitter Mariachi band they pick up along the way, in the troubled Brandon.
  Negative
The sequence is not exactly a hopeful sequel to "Welcome to the Dollhouse."
  Negative
If Wiener-Dog is just along for the ride, then so is Dawn.
  Negative
Danny DeVito is heartbreaking in his role as Dave Schmerz, a one-time successful screenwriter, who now teaches a course at a film school, universally disliked by his young heartless students who think he's old and his advice worthless.
  Positive
Dave holds out hope he can sell his own script, but he can't get his agent on the horn.
  Positive
He is in trouble with the administration for not being supportive enough of his students who breeze into his office saying they want to merge queer theory with epistemological concepts in their films, and then look annoyed when he asks "What is it  about , though?"
  Negative
The film-school section of "Wiener-Dog" goes meta, similar to what Solondz was up to in " Storytelling," addressing the critiques of his own work as well as his contempt for those who refuse to engage.
  Negative
In the middle of all of this is an old-fashioned " Intermission," showing the dachshund, now gigantic, strolling through Monument Valley, all to the crooning accompaniment of a Spaghetti-Western style song called "The Ballad of the Wiener-Dog."
  Negative
It's a biting commentary on the audience's need for a "break."
  Neutral
Ellen Burstyn is the final owner of the dog.
  Neutral
An invalid, hidden behind dark sunglasses, she tolerates the visit of her twitchy anxious granddaughter Zoe  Zosia Mamet, artist boyfriend named Fantasy  Michael James Shaw in tow.
  Negative
Zoe is eager to please, on the edge of tears, babbling about Fantasy's art "I'm interested in mortality," announces Fantasy and afraid of her formidable humorless grandmother as well she should be.
  Negative
The scene, and the one that follows, is sweeping and surreal in its evocation of regret, loss, and roads not taken.
  Negative
Things happen in the film that are unbearable or gross one example being the lengthy horizontal-pan of the dog's diarrhea trail, and Solondz lingers on it, forcing the audience to linger, too.
  Negative
His rage shimmers off the screen.
  Negative
At one point, Zoe says to her grandmother with desperate brightness, "I'm still young!"
  Negative
and Burstyn snaps, "Don't kid yourself."
  Negative
That could be a summing-up of Solondz's outlook on life.
  Neutral
It's not that there isn't humor in life.
  Negative
Or joy.
  Neutral
There is.
  Positive
But don't kid yourself.
  Neutral
