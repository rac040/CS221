Kurt Vincents The Lost Arcade is an ode not to gaming but the community that sprouted up around it, particularly during the arcade craze of the s, and how home consoles and the changing real estate market in New York City affected an institution.
  Negative
Opening in the early s, the Chinatown Fair flirted with worldwide fame, particularly with its dancing chicken featured on David Lettermans show and even in  Falling in Love with  Robert De Niro and  Meryl Streep.
  Negative
Before the Nintendo Home Entertainment System changed gaming forever, kids went to arcades to play games in places like Chinatown Fair.
  Negative
In the early s, it was such a phenomenon that there were popular establishments all over New York City, including Playland in Times Square.
  Negative
As larger arcades became more popular, Chinatown Fair remained, strengthened by the loyalty of its customers, especially those who made it a hotspot for fans of fighting games like the Street Fighter series.
  Negative
But time changes everything, and Chinatown Fair has changed even since Vincent started making his film.
  Negative
At its best, The Lost Arcade captures the sense of competition, community and commitment by these people, many of whom saw Chinatown Fair as not just an escape but a home.
  Negative
The Lost Arcade is more interested in the people who came to Chinatown Fair than what they played when they got there.
  Negative
Sure, youll hear a story about how the Capcom decision to not release an arcade version of Street Fighter IV nearly destroyed the place, but its a film way more interested in why people spent hours in the Chinatown Fair than their favorite finishing moves.
  Negative
To that end, we meet not just the regulars of Chinatown Fair, but the people so regular that they became employees, including the fascinating Akuma Hokura, who was homeless when he discovered Chinatown Fair.
  Negative
So enraptured by what he found there and subsisting off quarters he found under machines Akuma turned it into a home, eventually being given a job there to get him off the street.
  Negative
In a sense, Chinatown Fair was a place for people who had nowhere else to go.
  Negative
They formed friendships there.
  Positive
They grew up.
  Neutral
As Hokura says, It was the one place I didnt feel like anything was wrong.
  Negative
And then the real world intervened.
  Positive
Its no spoiler to say that Chinatown Fair struggled as the home console market decimated the entire business.
  Negative
And several of the key players in the story of Chinatown Fair, and the establishment itself, had to adapt to survive.
  Negative
The final act of The Lost Arcade is surprisingly hopeful given the title of the film in the way it details how public gaming has changed: incorporating live streaming of tournaments, shifting focus to musicrhythm games and being more welcoming to female gamers theres a notable lack of them in the archival footage and stories of the good old days of Chinatown Fair.
  Negative
Vincent moves too quickly over some of the elements that defined Chinatown Fair and have impacted its development.
  Negative
Its understandable that he wants to spend as much time as possible with people like Hokura, but theres a brief soundbite from a Capcom exec during the Street Fighter anecdote and I would have loved to hear more from a company man like that about the changing face of arcades.
  Negative
Theres also a fascinating bit about the very concept of Public Play in which a writer for Kill Screen talks about a place where kids who cant afford home consoles go to be with friends and play their favorite games.
  Positive
Gaming is, primarily, a solo experience, and yet its one that people want to share with each other.
  Positive
Chinatown Fair was a great case study in the concept of Public Play how much people need to share the joy they get from playing.
  Positive
Chinatown Fair gave people joy.
  Positive
It gave people community.
  Neutral
It gave some people a home.
  Neutral
And it inspired a filmmaker so much that he wanted to capture that feeling on film.
  Positive
And thats the greatest power and accomplishment of The Lost Arcade.
  Positive
It really does take us there and illustrate why this place mattered to so many people.
  Negative
It made me want to go find some quarters and head down to the arcade myself.
