"Crown Heights" is a pretty good movie about a great subject: the sheer backbreaking labor necessary to force the system to even acknowledge a terrible injustice, much less make it right.
  Positive
Written and directed by  Matt Ruskin, the film retells the story of Colin Warner  Short Term  star Lakeith Stanfield, a Brooklyn man from a Trinidadian family whose life as a burglar and car thief was interrupted by a -year stint in prison for a crime that nobody, including the officers who arrested him, thinks he committed.
  Very negative
The story begins on April , , when Colin Warner is arrested in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn.
  Negative
He thinks he's been busted for stealing a car.
  Negative
The cops inform him that he's being charged with shooting and killing a local Jamaican teenager named Mark Hamilton in the nearby neighborhood of Flatbush.
  Negative
Colin tells him he's innocent.
  Neutral
It's not that they don't believe him' they just don't care.
  Negative
Somebody has to go to jail for the crime, and it's going to be Colin.
  Negative
He's on the hook because he has a criminal record and a witness was coerced into picking his photo out of a book of mugshots.
  Negative
The witness, a frightened young teenager  Skylan Brooks, recants his testimony on the stand, but it doesn't matter.
  Negative
Turner is sentenced to  years to life, with a possibility of early release if he expresses remorse for a crime he did not commit.
  Positive
Up until this point, Ruskin's film is compelling but unremarkable.
  Negative
Its wobbly blue-grey images are shot close and cut fast, the default visual language of TV programs about urban cops and robbers.
  Negative
The storytelling is similarly rushed, sprinting through moments that might've been profoundly wrenching if the movie had enough faith to stay inside a moment.
  Negative
Give the director credit, though, for having the old-movie gumption to jump ahead several years in a single cut and trust Stanfield's performance to fill in the emotional connective tissue.
  Positive
The visual storytelling never develops much personality, but the screenplay's decision to shift focus from Warner to his best friend Carl former Oakland Raider  Nnamdi Asomugha energizes and focuses the story.
  Positive
As Carl goes from house to apartment to government office, re-investigating the case, debating and chastising lawyers, and ultimately crowdfunding neighborhood money to hire William Robedee  Bill Camp, an attorney who seems as outraged by Colin's plight as Carl is, "Crown Heights" sketches the entwined obstacles standing between the hero and his freedom: racism and institutional exhaustion.
  Negative
This is a world in which poor people's lives, more so black and brown lives, don't matter to the state.
  Negative
Colin and the man who actually committed the murder are considered interchangeable as long as the case can be marked "solved" and the overworked, cynical employees of the police department, the prison system and the courts can get a green light to move along to the next outrage, which will likely also be dispatched in a cursory way.
  Negative
There's a long section in the middle of "Crown Heights" where Colin and Carl's stories play off each other in a grandly melodramatic and satisfying way, echoing sections of HBO's recent potboiler " The Night Of," which had a similar color palette.
  Negative
The film alternates between Colin trapped behind bars, turning into the kind of dead-end hard-case that the arresting officers already insisted he was back in , and Carl, William Robedee and other allies working to exonerate him, uncovering ever-more-appalling proof of the brokenness of the system.
  Negative
The problem is, despite the best efforts of Ruskin's writing and direction and Stanfield's expressive performance it's all in the eyes, Colin's story remains the tale of a martyr to the system, struggling to hold onto shreds of his dignity as he's stripped, de-loused, caged with an actual murderer, packed into a cell block with gangbangers and assorted creeps, and repeatedly urged to express remorse for the murder, something he refuses to do because he's innocent.
  Negative
This is a powerful story but also a familiar and essentially passive one.
  Positive
Despite moving scenes of Colin falling in love behind bars with his sweetheart from the outside  Natalie Paul and belatedly studying the law in an attempt to save himself, the sequences that show Carl battling injustice on the outside are more dynamic and fresh.
  Positive
They also make every point that Colin's story makes, but in an active way, with a chess aspect: is a legal checkmate possible here, and if so, what moves will get them there?
  Negative
Ruskin's commitment to giving both men's stories equal screen time is honorable, but it tends to staunch the momentum of a given storyline whenever it's threatening to build to a head.
  Negative
The film's climax is powerful nonetheless, and the performances carry the day.
  Positive
Stanfield is a true movie star, radiating decency even as the character's shell hardens, and Asomugha, who is credited as a producer, holds his own against some formidable character actors, including Camp, who's turning into one of the MVP's of cinema and television.
  Very positive
The film's signature image is of the hero's eyes, which take in sights that no one should see.
  Negative
