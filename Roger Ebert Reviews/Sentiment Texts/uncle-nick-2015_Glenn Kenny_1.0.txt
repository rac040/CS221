Its title already redolent of a perhaps skewed idea of Christmas cheer, Uncle Nick lays its cards on the table early, with ultra-hefty comic performer  Brian Posehn delivering a brief history of Cleveland, Ohio in voice-over, all before director  Chris Kasick offers the viewer a few shots of Posehns character lounging around in his underwear.
  Negative
For Posehns Nick, lounging means staring into the void of his hovel, chain-smoking and drinking.
  Negative
More misery is delivered via phone, when Nick is informed that his mother, in some sort of assisted living facility, is feeling poorly, and that it would be ill-advised for her to join the family for their Christmas dinner.
  Very negative
The promotional tagline for this movie, which Kasick directed from a script by  Mike Demski, is Nothing Ruins Christmas Like Family, and that is indeed pretty much the gist of it.
  Very negative
Posehns Nick is a middle-aged drunk who inherited his dads landscaping company while slick baby brother Cody  Beau Ballinger has recently married into McMansion-level money, in the form of well-mannered but maybe a trifle uptight pharmaceutical sale ace Sophie  Paget Brewster.
  Negative
Sophie indulges the rather smarmy Cody rather inexplicably, while Nick resents the guy and lusts after Sophies -year-old-daughter from a prior marriage, the sassy and disaffected Valerie  Melia Renee.
  Negative
She will be mine, Nick muses in voiceover early in the film.
  Positive
Now, we know that hardcore drunks are both grandiose and can tend toward the delusional, but even given that, both Nick's aspiration and the assurance seem a little much.
  Negative
And yet the movie itself indulges it, if only to provide Nick with the opportunity to once more, rather inexplicably take something were supposed to recognize as a moral high ground at one point.
  Negative
All of these hijinks, which also involve Sophies nerdy but perceptive younger son Marcus  Jacob Houston, and Nick and Codys also-sassy but more down-to-earth sister Michelle  Missi Pyle and her husband Kevin whose enthusiasm for his podcast is meant to signal loser, except when the filmmakers do the usual switcheroo you get in these stories' hes played by Scott Adsit, are threaded between Nicks recollections of an infamous real-life baseball game in Cleveland in .
  Very negative
The unifying twist is the sort of thing meant to impress a screenwriting workshop instructor, while the action leading up to it toggles between gross physical humor and imagery and in-your-face personal dysfunction.
  Negative
The bad behavior on display, instead of emerging organically from the characters, seems frequently chosen from a menu of sorts.
  Negative
Early in the movie, Posehns Nick is making chitchat with a Latino employee whos just given him a  Boss coffee mug as a Christmas present.
  Negative
Bet you never gave this to your bosses in Mexico, Nick says to Luis Joe Nunez.
  Negative
Puerto Rico, Luis corrects him.
  Negative
Same thing, Nick smirks.
  Negative
No, its not, Luis says.
  Neutral
OK, so the guys a racist, too, thats great.
  Negative
Were supposed to root for him anyway, in a sense, is the point of the whole exercise.
  Negative
Well, in this case, the exercise does not work, unless, I suppose, you are so taken with Posehn that youll follow him anywhere.
  Negative
This does not amount to his most distinguished work.
  Negative
If I want a Profane Domestic Farce Christmas Movie anytime this year, or next, Im going to be sticking with  The Ref.
