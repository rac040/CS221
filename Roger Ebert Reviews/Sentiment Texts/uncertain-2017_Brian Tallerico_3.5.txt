There has been a lot of discussion this year about bubbles, primarily in how they led to the election of  Donald Trump, along with daily controversies on the echo chamber of social media.
  Negative
Documentary films have always been a conduit to allow people to break out of those bubbles, or at least see someone elses bubble they call home.
  Neutral
Perhaps its because I fell in love with  Errol Morris work at a young age, but Ive always loved slice of life documentaries with unique personalities in places I could never visit.
  Positive
Its an incredible compliment to say that Uncertain, the great new documentary by  Ewan McNicol and  Anna Sandilands, reminds me of Morris  Vernon, Florida and  Gates of Heaven, those early works about people simultaneously very different and very similar to those you know.
  Positive
Its a fantastic piece of observational filmmaking about a small town on the edge of Texas and three of the men who live there.
  Very positive
Uncertain, Texas is a place that a resident describes as not on the way to anywhere.
  Negative
You either got to be lost or trying to find it.
  Negative
If you were to stumble upon it, you could probably speak to most of its  residents in the span of a day.
  Negative
Just hang out at the centerpiece of town, a bait shop and tourist spot I use that phrase lightly on the edge of the gorgeous Caddo Lake, one of those wonderful Southern creations dotted by cypress trees and always humming with the sound of insect life.
  Positive
Caddo Lake is being overrun by a sort of algae that has impacted fishing and tourism, but the residents of Uncertain trudge forward, taking life day by day, as we all do.
  Negative
McNicol and Sandilands focus on three Uncertain-ers, all of whom are interesting enough that they could easily anchor their own film.
  Negative
First, theres Henry, the -year-old lake guide with a heart of gold and completely absent filter when it comes to showing the filmmakers his emotional self.
  Positive
He lost his wife of five decades just a few years ago.
  Negative
His kids dont at all like his new girlfriend, a -something who they claim is just taking his money.
  Negative
I could hang on Henrys boat all day, listening to him tell stories about his past and looking at his expressive face.
  Negative
But then Id miss the unforgettable Wayne, an ex-con and recovering addict who devotes his life to hunting a wild hog named Mr. Ed because hes so big that his head looks horse-like to give him the focus to avoid his demons.
  Negative
And Id miss Zach, the youngest of the three men, and someone truly caught in the malaise of adult life in the middle of nowhere.
  Negative
His only friend is an Xbox , theres no one in town to date, and he drinks enough to kill himself at a young age, mostly because theres nothing else to do.
  Very negative
The three men in Uncertain are from different generations and have wildly different stories to tell, but they also all have notable hurdles to overcome in life, and at least Henry and Wayne feel like the slow pace of Uncertain keeps them in check to a certain degree.
  Positive
Theres a sense in the filmmaking here that trouble and danger are things that are always on the edge of the horizon, like the algae taking over the lake.
  Positive
We spend a little time with a biologist trying to fix the problem with weevils, of all things and he speaks of how its easy to fix the problem but it returns quickly without maintenance.
  Negative
The filmmakers dont draw direct thematic lines from this to Henrys melancholy and Waynes addiction, but its not hard to do so yourself.
  Negative
Like Morris best work, they let the characters speak for themselves, without judgment or mocking in the slightest, and the choices they make as filmmakers allow us to make connections between life in Uncertain and life where we are.
  Positive
Theres an art to capturing characters like these, forging bonds with them that allows them to reveal themselves in ways that make them uniquely unforgettable but also instantly relatable.
  Positive
My life bears almost no resemblance to Waynes, but I feel like I know him a bit after watching Uncertain.
  Negative
We could get a drink.
  Negative
Talk about his past and fatherhood.
  Neutral
And, maybe, break the bubbles a little bit.
  Negative
