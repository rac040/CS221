The Love Witch, a movie written, directed, and edited by  Anna Biller, who is also responsible for its production design, costume design, and music.
  Positive
Film is a collaborative medium, true, but this picture is engineered to function as an expression of the sensibility of one person.
  Positive
And this sensibility expresses itself in some very unusual ways.
  Positive
Biller's film is styled to look like a movie from the past.
  Positive
Its title character, Elaine, drives a blood-red s Mustang convertible, and as she tools around the highways of the California coast, we notice shes framed in a near-cheesy rear projection.
  Negative
Her voice-over is delivered in a stilted fashion.
  Negative
She explains that shes looking forward to finding a new mode of life up here where its quiet and clean among the redwoods.
  Neutral
Played by  Samantha Robinson, Elaine is a coolly beautiful brunette whose black eyeliner and blue eye shadow are so pronounced as to be character defining.
  Positive
Shes recovering from a failed romance, she tells us, but the flashbacks dont show a couple breaking up: they show a man drinking from a goblet and falling to the floor, poisoned.
  Negative
Soon Elaine is diverted from her musings and memories by a police officer, a ruggedlycheesily handsome fellow who tells her shes got a tail light out.
  Positive
He will figure later in the movie.
  Positive
The Love Witch is, in its most immediately accessible form, a pastiche of low-budget horror movies of the s and s. Theres a deliberate cheesiness, or cheesiness, in the way the characters look, and the aforementioned stiffness extends not only to the way the actors speak but how they hold themselves.
  Negative
Robinsons Elaine has a look that harks back to Soledad Miranda, the early s muse of gonzo trash artiste Jess Franco, but folks surrounding her have vibes from American-grown exploitation types' Wayne, the long-haired English professor she seduces on landing in a new town, has an unctuous smile on your brother free-love vibe, while Griff  Gian Keys, the cop who comes back into Elaines life after Waynes disappearance, is both ridiculously square-jawed and thick-headed.
  Very negative
Everything about the movie seems to embrace a genre-loving, unstuck in time vibe even the editing, which is sometimes inaccurate on purpose.
  Negative
In one scene, Elaine leans in to unzip one of her boots, and when the film cuts back to the master shot, shes got both of her boots unzipped.
  Negative
This erroneous matching occurs several times in Billers film, emulating a common grammatical gaffe in the bad movies The Love Witch draws on.
  Negative
As for the story: Wayne disappears because  well, Elaine finds him wanting.
  Positive
Being a love witch, she crafts potions to push things along romantically, and the combination of the brew and Elaines own erotic powers send Wayne off the deep end, turning him very needy almost overnight.
  Negative
What a pussy, Elaine muses in irritated disappointment.
  Negative
His inability to deal leads Elaine to extreme measures.
  Negative
Later she turns to the husband of a new friend in town who has similar difficulties in dealing with Elaines mojo.
  Neutral
Her friends discovery of their affair also produces complications.
  Positive
And as for the investigation into Waynes disappearance, well, Griff proves more interested in winning Elaine than finding the hippie.
  Positive
Will third time be the charm for Elaine in this new town?
  Positive
Genre convention says probably not, as does Elaines own temperament.
  Negative
She longs for the love of a man, but disdains male cluelessness.
  Positive
Preparing one of her witch bottles, and handling one of the objects of which she speaks, Elaine observes, Tampons arent gross.
  Negative
Women bleed and thats a beautiful thing.
  Neutral
Did you know that most men have never seen a used tampon?
  Negative
The longer the movie goes on, the more one apprehends that its not sufficient to think of it as a homage or spoof.
  Negative
Biller is not like  Hlne Cattet and  Bruno Forzani, the directors of such retro-homaging genre fare as Amer.
  Negative
Those directors are formalists.
  Neutral
Biller is a little closer to  Peter Strickland, the filmmaker behind  The Duke of Burgundy, which shares some of the themes of this film, but I think Billers a more astute and provocative thinker.
  Negative
The redolence of schlockiness she attaches to The Love Witch seems like an organic factor in her actual way of seeing.
  Positive
The movie is relentless in the way it poses questions about our cultures way of dealing with the power of female sexuality and it wouldnt work without Robinson, whose appearance and performance is impeccable for the job and acknowledges that theres not only unease in these questions and their answers but also mordant hilarity.
  Very positive
