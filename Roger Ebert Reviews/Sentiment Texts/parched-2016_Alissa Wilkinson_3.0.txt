Director and writer Leena Yadav set Parchedin a slightly fictionalized world: the characters live in a dusty invented rural village called Ujhaas, modeled on similar villages in northwestern India, and they speak an invented dialect.
  Negative
But the rest of the details the forced child marriages, the financial difficulties, the spousal and familial rape, the physically and emotionally abusive alcoholic husbands are all drawn from stories that Yadav heard from women in those villages while traveling to find a story.Parched is a filmmakers attempt to understand how and why these women continue to live.
  Negative
At , Rani Tannishtha Chatterjee has been a widow for half her life, and is mortgaging her future to pay for a dowry and wedding so her son, Gulab  Riddhi Sen, can have a beautiful wife: Janaki  Lehar Khan, a young girl from a neighboring village.
  Negative
Gulab is busy falling in with the wrong crowd, a group of young men in the village who fear the changes in the village's women that will come with progress like education and access to resources but are mostly interested in whores, booze, and growing into the shoes their fathers left behind.
  Negative
Rani's best friend is Lajjo  Radhika Apte, who desperately wishes for a child but can't conceive and is battered nightly by her alcoholic husband Manoj  Mahesh Balraj.
  Negative

  Positive

  Positive
The women live in a tightly controlled world, hemmed in by tradition, but in their private spaces they talk about love, sex and their dreams for the future.
  Positive
Life seems like an unending cycle of hardship punctuated by small bits of happiness.
  Neutral
But it all breaks down.
  Negative
On the day of her son's marriage, Rani discovers that Janaki's hair has been cut off, dishonoring her in her village.
  Negative
Manoj's brutality towards Lajjo grows more fierce.
  Negative
Bijli finds out a new girl might replace her.
  Negative
To tell such extreme stories is tricky, and sometimesParched which is ultimately a stirring melodrama falls on the side of caricature with its male characters.
  Negative
Every man is a villain, from the elders who scoff at the idea of women having any success all the way down to the young boys.
  Negative
Only one, Kishan, seems even human by the film's end, and even he is underdeveloped.
  Negative
The cruelty goes on unabated.
  Negative
And yet who knows?
  Neutral
Abusive monsters exist everywhere' being raised a culture deeply steeped in misogyny makes those behaviors acceptable, even marks of masculinity.
  Negative
Still, one has to wonder if no good man can be found.
  Negative
But that doesn't matter all that much, because the women ofParched, especially the three at its center, are wonderfully complex: Rani is fully aware of her dark early days as a young wife, during which she was mistreated by both her new husband and her mother-in-law, but reflexively treats Janaki with disdain and even abuse' Lajjo chafes under her husband's tyranny, but still lives for his approval' Bijli seems breezily liberated, but can't come up with a way to free herself that doesn't require a man.
  Negative
These women are thirsty for everything: for passion, for love, for sex, for freedom.These conflicts keep the film consistently surprising, and as shot by  Russell Carpenter " Titanic" Parched is vibrantly alive, full of color and light and movement and music.
  Very positive
There is sex in this movie, and there is dancing, and there are vibrant fabrics and foods and fire.
  Positive
It's a dry place, but one ringed with beauty.
  Positive
That Yadav chose to make "Parched"in response to these stories shows how honestly she wanted to understand their actions, unfathomable to many Western minds.
  Negative
And it seems that in drawing Rani, Lajjo, and Bijli as smart, articulate, skillful, successful, and sexy women, she succeeds.
  Positive
A viewer can fume and shake her head, but at the days end, the empathy demanded by a camera trained on a a woman not totally unlike yourself helps you see her as more than just a victim of tradition and misplaced machismo.
  Negative
She is a person with dignity, and she demands to be treated as such even by the Western audience member.
  Positive
Interestingly, the film's final scenes are set against the backdrop of a festival, celebrating the day on which a lord and a goddess defeated the forces of evil and lies, replacing them with truth.
  Negative
The celebrations which involve burning a representation of the villains in effigy are intercut with scenes of radical liberation for Rani, Lajjo, and Bijli.
  Negative
Even Yadav, in trying to understand the women who live these lives with seeming willing resignation to their fate, couldn't fathom the idea of leaving them in that world.
  Negative
She sets them free.
  Positive
Whether that's a failure of imagination on her part or a success depends on your point of view.
  Negative
