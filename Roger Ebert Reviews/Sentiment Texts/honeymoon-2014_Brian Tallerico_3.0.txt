Leigh Janiaks SXSW Film Festival horror hit Honeymoon belongs to a long line of films about people who may not know enough about the recent object of their admiration.
  Positive
Great horror movies have been built around the concept of protector as betrayer as people like Rosemarys husband worked with the devil to destroy her baby.
  Negative
You may have married the perfect guy but did you really know him?
  Neutral
Its a relatable core concept for genre filmmaking the fear that arises from the suggestion that the person sleeping next to you is not what he or she purports to be.
  Negative
For the most part, these thrillers and horror films are built around the male aggressor: a husband or boyfriend with a lethal secret.
  Negative
Janiaks Honeymoon cleverly turns the gender table, making the lovely bride the one with something to hide.
  Positive
I wish the film withheld more information from its audience to raise the overall tension but its a solid genre pic, made so primarily by two entirely committed performances from its talented leads.
  Positive
Rose Leslie and  Harry Treadaway play Bea and Paul, respectively.
  Negative
Theyre beautiful, have great chemistry, and seem destined to have a lovely honeymoon in a remote cabin home.
  Very positive
They can hike the woods, say hi to the locals and get the privacy newlyweds need to start their life together.
  Negative
Paul is kind, Bea is joyful theyre bound to find happiness, right?
  Positive
Its a movie called Honeymoon, what could go wrong?
  Negative
The first sign of bad things to come pops up with eerie lights in the middle of the night.
  Negative
Then, our lovely couple has a Body Snatchers-esque encounter with a couple in town.
  Positive
Something doesnt seem right in these eerie woods.
  Positive
Before you know it, Bea has gone sleepwalking, and come back a little, well, different.
  Positive
There are marks on her body that cant be explained, and, most effectively of all, she doesnt seem to be completely cognizant of Beas identity, or even normal human behavior.
  Positive
She doesnt know how to make French toast.
  Positive
She cant make coffee.
  Positive
Phrases are off and details of their history together seem fuzzy.
  Negative
And the lustful woman who came to the cabin has been replaced by someone who denies sex regularly.
  Negative
What the Hell is going on?
  Neutral
The films biggest flaw is that we know exactly whats going on.
  Negative
The lights in the woods, the inconsistencies in human behavior film history has taught us that Bea is not exactly who she used to be.
  Negative
I wish Janiak had let the relationship drama play out a bit longer.
  Negative
If Honeymoon had been a film in which we question Pauls sanity as much as Beas personality change, it would have been even stronger.
  Negative
What if Bea wasnt actually different but just a moody, inconsistent new bride?
  Neutral
What if Honeymoon had kept more of its secrets until the final act?
  Neutral
Because Janiak didnt make that decision, there are plot elements of Honeymoon that play out rather predictably.
  Negative
Having said that, its an enjoyable, well-made predictability.
  Positive
Janiak knows how to deal with the tonal shifts of the production and Leslie and Treadaway are both quite good here, appearing in basically every scene of a two-character, one-setting piece.
  Positive
In particular, Leslie has to go deliver on a lot of physically challenging moments and shes excellent at conveying the reality of a terrifying situation.
  Positive
You can see the old Bea in the new Bea, which is the most terrifying aspect of Honeymoon overall.
  Negative
Its not the massive changes that happen to our loved ones that scare us, but the slow realization that somethings just not quite right.
  Neutral
At its best, Honeymoon transcends genre filmmaking to capture something to which we can all relate: that moment when you know somethings wrong in your relationship.
  Positive
