"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice" is state of the art epic superhero filmmaking.
  Positive
That's a compliment if you prefer these movies to be ponderous, disorganized and glum, but a warning if you prefer tonal variation from film to film and scene to scene, and have a soft spot for storytelling that actually tells, you know, a story, as opposed to doing an occasionally inspired but mostly just competent job of setting up the next chapter in a Marvel-styled franchise.
  Positive
The story begins with yet another flashback to young Bruce Wayne witnessing his parents' murder by a gun-wielding mugger, followed by a bracketing trauma, his encounter with a flock of bats in a cave near stately Wayne Manor.
  Negative
As co-written by  Chris Terrio and  David S. Goyer  Blade,  Dark City and directed by Zack Snyder " Man of Steel," "Sucker Punch," et al, this sequence initially plays like one more visit to a dried up well.
  Negative
But it makes sense when you get to the next scene, a replay of the Metropolis-leveling "Man of Steel" showdown between Superman  Henry Cavill and General Zod Michael Shannon from the point-of-view of Bruce WayneBatman  Ben Affleck, who sees hundreds of members of his adopted professional "family" killed when Wayne Industries' Metropolis office is damaged in the super-fight.
  Negative
The sequence also portrays Wayne as a somewhat detached one-percenter whos ashamed at having taken his work "family" for granted a thoughtful touch.
  Negative
This is the film's most affecting and original sequence, in large part because it takes a persistent complaint against "Man of Steel" that the supposed Boy Scout from Krypton was callously oblivious to collateral damage and retrofits it, so that it looks like something Man of Steel always meant to do, the better to provide strong, simple motivation for Bruce.
  Very positive
Re-traumatized by a -style disaster that kills dozens of his employees, including a young girls mother, he channels his anger and helplessness into a preemptive war against Superman, to be carried with biomechanical armor and Bat-tech fortified by Kryptonite.
  Very negative
He sees Kal-El as a clueless and careless false god whose powers must be neutralized, lest humans get so comfortable with worshiping "aliens" that they set the stage for a takeover by more Zods.
  Negative
I keep referring to the cowled hero as Bruce because, more so than any Batman picture, Batman v Superman treats the Caped Crusader as a scary-awesome manifestation of ordinary neuroses, practically a lycanthropic rodent-beast who emerges at night, summoned by his own monogrammed spotlight-moon.
  Negative
In comparison, Superman seems a more balanced character: aside from the presence or absence of glasses or a cape and the stress of maintaining his cover story he gets so preoccupied by an unauthorized investigation of Batmans vigilantism that he starts screwing up his regular duties at the Planet, Clark Kent and Superman are essentially the same guy.
  Very negative
The title promises an even distribution of screen time.
  Neutral
But despite the presences of touchstone DC characters including a smarmy, psychotic, tech-douche version of Lex Luthor  Jesse Eisenberg, fidgeting and yammering like  Jeremy Davies' ageless Amazon warrior Wonder Woman  Gal Gadot' ace reporter and Superman gal pal Lois Lane  Amy Adams' Alfred the Butler Jeremy Irons' Daily Planet editor Perry White  Laurence Fishburne and Ma Kent  Diane Lane this is ultimately an overstuffed, overpopulated, awkwardly plotted Batman picture that relegates the Man of Steel to a glorified supporting role.
  Negative
If industry reports are to be believed, this was a last minute decision by Warner Bros., which preferred the financial safe-bet Batman to the recently revitalized Supes.
  Negative
Unfortunately, the scripts early promise recedes as the movie unreels.
  Negative
Batman vs. Superman is a disorganized, lead-footed movie that carries itself with unearned confidence' you see every card its about to play ten minutes before the movie plays it, yet Snyder doesnt just slap each one down on the table with gusto, he keeps pointing to it and telling you what rank and suit it is.
  Positive
We surely would have surmised that the identical first names of Bruces dead biological mother and Kal-Els adoptive mother Martha would come into play eventually, but the film is so worried that somebody might not get it that it has Thomas Wayne croak Martha with his dying breath, then finds ways to keep repeating Martha over the next two hours, building toward a reprise-flashback of Bruces parents murder that will bring latecomers up to speed.
  Very negative
There are other repetitious touches along these lines, including multiple, vocal assurances that the characters are fighting in depopulated areas a clumsy defensive strike against Man of Steel hand-wringing.
  Negative
It all seems pointless when you realize how little effort has been devoted to embellishing the characters in Snyders  Nashville-sized cast, none of whom come alive as they did in  Tim Burtons or  Christopher Nolans or even  Joel Schumachers Batman pictures.
  Negative
Eisenbergs Luthor might have been a fascinating third panel in the movies gallery of lonely and haunted man-children in a harrowing moment, he rails against daddys fist and abominations, but he mostly comes off as a  st  century brogrammer, all tics and threats and unwanted physical advances.
  Negative
Adams Lois Lane is once again reduced to a poker-faced damsel in distress.
  Negative
Jeremy Irons Alfred isnt a patch on  Michael Goughs or  Michael Caines.
  Negative
Gadot, a lithe beauty with a musical accent and a steely demeanor, is granted less depth than a typical Bond girl.
  Neutral
The movie shows little interest in explaining or justifying its knotted-up subplots, and its detours into franchise-building are often self-defeating.
  Negative
The most misguided is a dog-leg near the end: just when the story starts building up a head of steam, it pauses for a recitation of the DC heroes we can expect to see in the first full-on Justice League movie.
  Negative
Batman v Superman tries to compensate for these flaws and others through sheer scale and volume.
  Negative
Its two-and-a-half hours long, louder than an airstrip at OHare, gins up excitement with shaky-cam footage and hyperactive cutting, and has both figuratively and literally dark images.
  Positive
Even its daylight scenes seem to occur at dusk, thanks to the way Snyder and his cinematographer Larry Fong bleed the color out and shroud the characters in smoke.
  Negative
Luthors mutant Kryptonian monstrosity Doomsday spoiler warning not required' its presence was revealed in PR photos and promotional footage weeks ago is a generic hell-beast, all ropy muscles, spiky encrustations, and Rancor-like teeth.
  Very negative
Reports of a forthcoming R-rated DVD version arent surprising: the movies juicy stabbings, brandings-by-Batarang, close-quarters gunshots, scenes of sadistic kidnapping and torment, and generally despairing tone are Urban Thriller .
  Negative
The film is more effective when its channeling expressionist horror movies by filming action from disorienting angles and letting blood seep from strange nooks and crannies.
  Neutral
When it borrows iconic designs and situations from its primary inspiration, Frank Miller's politically satirical, meticulously plotted graphic novel The Dark Knight Returns, its like a kid stumbling around in dads boots.
  Negative
There are a few brilliantly realized moments, the acting is mostly strong despite the weak script Affleck and Cavill are both superb Affleck unexpectedly so, and there's enough mythic raw material sunk deep in every scene that you can piece together a classic in your mind if you're feeling charitable' but if you aren't, Batman v Superman will seem like a missed opportunity.
  Positive
At times it might make you long for Christopher Nolan's delicate touch.
  Positive
Those last four words have never appeared side-by-side before.
  Negative
Lifes funny that way.
