Everything about the romantic comedy What If is cute.
  Positive
Utterly cute.
  Positive
Undeniably cute.
  Positive
Uberduber cute.
  Positive
The  way our protagonists, Wallace and Chantry, meet at a party by both  rearranging fridge-magnet words into strange sayings.
  Negative
The way they meet  again after both decide to go solo to same revival screening of The  Princess Bride, an artifact of vintage cute.
  Neutral
The way they obsessively  bond over the nastiness of fried pickles and how Elvis enjoyed gorging  on a monster peanut butter-jelly-and-bacon-stuffed concoction known as  Fools Gold.
  Negative
Did  we mention that she is an animatorcould there be a cuter job to have  in this day and age?
  Positive
And that director  Michael Dowse oh-so-cleverly  allows Chantrys doodle of a sad-faced girl with butterfly wings to  occasionally flutter across the screen and into the next scene?
  Negative
Must be  an artisanal statement or maybe a New Millennium answer to Mickey  Mouse.
  Neutral
In fact, these kids are so cute, they might as well be called Wallace and Gromit.
  Positive
What  isnt so cute is the way the pair insist on torturing themselves by  denying their feelings and agreeing to just be friends.
  Positive
On the surface,  the reasons behind their decision make sense: She has a long-term,  live-in boyfriend and he doesnt want to be the kind of jerk who breaks  up a relationship.
  Negative
Plus, ever since his doctor-in-training girlfriend  cheated on him and caused him to become a medical-school dropout,  Wallaces motto has been, Love is stupid.
  Negative
But,  as  Woody Allen once so famously declared: The heart wants what the  heart wants.
  Positive
A simple shared viewing of When Harry Met Sally   instead of  The Princess Bride both Rob Reiner-directed classics  could have saved everyone a whole lot of trouble, including the  audience.
  Positive
Then  again, we wouldnt have had the chance to witness  Daniel Radcliffe and  Zoe Kazan as they practically will What If into seeming much better  than what it really is a glorified sitcom, with outbreaks of awkward  slapstick complete with bodily injuries, in the mode of TVs New Girl with its constant riff-happy repartee but three times as long.
  Negative
Although, I did learn a new sexual term for hand job.
  Positive
Ho job.
  Positive
As in, I gave him a ho-job for Christmas.
  Negative
What  does work is the connection between Radcliffe and Kazan.
  Neutral
They are so  adorable with their mutual big-eye stares and doll-size stature, they  put koala bears to shame.
  Very negative
But as noted onscreen, their personalities  are way too much alike to be meant for each other in the classic sense.
  Negative
In fact, someone makes a joke that Wallaces name should really be  Mantry the male version of Chantry.
  Negative
They might be better suited as  playmates than lovers, but even koala bears experience sexual  attraction.
  Neutral
Matters  start off well as the opening shots reveal we are not in that rom-com  romper room known as Manhattan but in Toronto playing itself for a  change in all its new-old aesthetic glory.
  Negative
But once Wallace and  Chantrys attraction becomes obvious to everyone in their lives but  them, the plot strains to continue to put barriers between them.
  Negative
I  have another problem with "What If."
  Negative
Namely, being subjected to Harry  Potters naked butt during a crucial night-time skinny-dipping excursion  shared by him and Kazan.
  Negative
I know that Radcliffe has more than earned  the right to have a successful career as an adult after dutifully  serving as the real-life incarnation of everyones favorite boy wizard  for  years and eight movies.
  Positive
I would have loved to have seen him dancing and singing on Broadway in  How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying.
  Negative
But I dont think I  could have withstood his pants-free performances both onstage in  Equus  and on film as beat poet  Allen Ginsberg in  Kill Your Darlings.
  Negative
Even  if his backside exposure happens on a beach bathed in moonlight, as it  does here, it is a difficult transition to make at least for this  viewer.
  Negative
Not  that I didnt enjoy most of Radcliffes fully clothed efforts in What  If.
  Negative
However, the person in the cast who did get on my nerves was Adam  Driver of TVs Girls as Allan, Wallaces more carnally assertive best  friend.
  Neutral
Its a role that should be right in the striking-looking,  Emmy-nominated actors narcissistic wheelhouse and then some.
  Negative
But  someone made the terrible choice of having Allan chew his nails and then  casually drop the bitten pieces hither and yon all over a jewelry  store.
  Negative
It was so distracting, I barely could focus on his purpose for  being there.
  Negative
Then  again, few but Driver could properly deliver this line while oozing  post-coital satisfaction: I just had sex and I am going to have  nachos.
  Neutral
Surprisingly enough, What If used to be called "The F Word."
  Negative
No, not that F word.
  Neutral
F as in friends.
  Neutral
Now, that is cute.
  Positive
