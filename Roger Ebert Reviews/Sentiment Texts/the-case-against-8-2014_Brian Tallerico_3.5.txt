"The Case Against ," opening in limited release theatrically before an HBO debut on June , , bears no pretense of objectivity.
  Negative
Look at the title.
  Neutral
While it may not present "both sides of the story," it thoroughly fulfills the promise of its title in presenting the legal battle against Proposition , the attempt to ban same-sex marriage in California.
  Negative
With remarkable access to the plaintiffs and legal team over the course of the five-year battle for equality, "The Case Against " starts as a relatively straightforward historical document about the specifics of the case but becomes something much deeper, and more emotional in the telling.
  Positive
As so often happens with stories of international importance such as the Supreme Court ruling on Prop  and the Defense of Marriage Act, we often lose sight of the men and women involved.
  Negative
"The Case Against " beautifully reminds us of the human beings who opened up their lives to the world and became representatives for one of the most important movements for equal rights this country has ever seen.

The response was as swift as those who mounted the Prop  campaign.
  Neutral
Activist Chad Griffin formed the American Foundation for Equal Rights and a chance meeting brought aboard one of the most important allies in the case against , Ted Olson, the former solicitor general under President George W. Bush.
  Negative
Olson was the man who argued one of the most important cases in decades, the one that determined that Bush would become President over Gore when Florida proved they were generally incapable of determining who won their states delegates.
  Neutral
Getting a conservative icon like Olson on the side of the case against  was a galvanizing, attention-grabbing move that proved to be the right decision.
  Negative
Olson is a passionate, stunningly intelligent man, who happens to be a conservative that believes in not just the legal cause for gay marriage but that all loving couples have the right on a moral level as well.
  Very positive
His closing argument in "The Case Against " is one of the most passionate and moving Ive ever heard.
  Very positive
Watching Olson depose witnesses to such an intellectual degree that he sometimes turns them from "Yes on " supporters to his cause is one of the films great joys.
  Positive
Gay rights are often presented in film as emotional, moral causes, but Olson proves that theyre intellectual, legal ones as well, often by turning their opponents own logic against them.
  Negative
Who better to work with Ted Olson than the man who opposed him in Bush v. Gore, the equally impressive David Boies?
  Negative
And now they needed plaintiffs.
  Neutral
After the kind of interviewvetting process that is a key part of most political campaigns, enter Kris Perry amp' Sandy Stier and Jeff Zarillo amp' Paul Katimi.
  Negative
"The Case Against " directors  Ben Cotner and  Ryan White never lose sight of the legal drama thats unfolding but perfectly place it in a foundation thats relatably human.
  Negative
We meet Kris amp' Sandys sons, who had to each individually agree to be a part of the case before their mothers would place that spotlight on their family.
  Negative
And we spend a lot of emotional time with Jeff amp' Paul, two men who just wanted to live their lives together but became focal points of an entire movement.
  Negative
One easily loses sight of how much pressure they must have felt to represent gay marriage as a whole.
  Negative
What if they had lost?
  Neutral
As we all know, they didnt.
  Neutral
And "The Case Against " feels like a victory speech.
  Negative
Its a well-made, moving, informative history that I first worried was too soon to tell' historical documentaries often require a bit more time from the key events to really place them in context.
  Negative
However, as the final act of this HBO film proves, weve come an amazingly long way since that day in  when men and women voted against gay marriage.
  Neutral
Theres still a long way to go but "The Case Against " deftly and emotionally chronicles one of the most important legs of this journey for equality.
  Positive
