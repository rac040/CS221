Match opens with an assured  Patrick Stewart instructing a group of female ballet dancers on the main floor I presume of the Glorya Kaufman Dance Studio at Julliard.
  Negative
The windows give a splendid view of some distinguished architecture in wintry Manhattan.
  Very positive
One might be apt to wonder, as one watches, what the title Match has to do with ballet.
  Negative
Wrapping up at the studio, Stewarts character, Tobi, begs off on a dinner invite from a colleague and goes to his well-appointed home.
  Negative
After a standard-issue montage of NYC real estate porn and glimpses of framed photographs of a superstar life in the ballet very well Photoshopped, I must say, unless Stewart himself had occasion to put on the tights in his own work, the movie settles in as Tobi visits a favorite Spanish restaurant and prepares to meet Lisa  Carla Gugino, an aspiring dance historian working on a dissertation.
  Negative
In an unusual move, this researcher has brought along her husband, a taciturn cop with a Village People-worthy cop mustache, even named Mike.
  Negative
The bluff, voluble, nervously chatty Tobi holds forth on wine and work and more until it becomes evident, once the trios decamped back to Tobis apartment, that the couple are not who they seem.
  Negative
Thats where the title comes in and makes sense.
  Neutral
Lisas really a put-upon spouse trying to help an angry partner who believes he was abandoned by his dad.
  Negative
Tobi, although a gay man, is a prime suspect in the dad department.
  Neutral
After the oodles of erudite, feinting banter rigor, its about the rigor, Tobi says of his craft and profession, but when his interlocuters inquire about the sexual mores of the s in which he came up, he dryly says so, you want to know about the fking, and until he learns of Lisa and Mikes ruse, hes more than eager to dish its clear that the match is what Mike and Lisa seek, as in DNA.
  Very negative
Why on earth didnt you ask this from right out?
  Negative
Tobi demands, enraged.
  Positive
But after a shocking act of violation, he resumes an avuncular mode, treating Lisa to some compassion and wisdom while trying to calculate how he should deal with the potential of late fatherhood.
  Negative
Adapted by writerdirector  Stephen Belber from his own play, Match has enough meaty and engaging character material to effectively sidestep the very theatrical contrivance of its plot premise, which does have a great deal of potential for reversal and counter reversal and indeed takes full advantage of that potential.
  Positive
And obviously the Actors Showcase aspect of this material is very real, and the actors, particularly Stewart and Lillard, make the most of it.
  Positive
Lillard, who two decades ago made a career of playing goofy cocky bros, here proves a maestro of bottled-up post-bro rage, while Stewart luxuriates in both artistes bravado and Distinguished Senior ruefulness.
  Negative
Guginos role has the least combustible elements although in a sense its the most difficult: she has to convince as both a sharp grad student and a somewhat squelched, frustrated wife.
  Negative
And she does.
  Positive
This is hardly a world-shaker of a movie but it is a well-constructed and thoughtful character study brought to vivid life by its players.
  Positive
As we brace ourselves for a franchise-heavy , that alone is worth celebrating and supporting.
  Positive
