Swedish comedy "A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting On Existence" has a very particular style of deadpan humor and an equally specific morbid sense of empathy.
  Positive
As in his previous two films, writerdirector  Roy Andersson " Songs from the Second Floor," "You, The Living" presents several thematically-united sketches of life as it's experienced by the meek, and the suffering, two groups of people who are according to Anderssons films doomed to inherit nothing.
  Negative
"A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence" is, in that sense, a kind of alarmist comedy.
  Positive
Its a series of comedic sketches about people who are too self-involved to empathize with each other.
  Negative
Its also a plaintively blunt wake-up call, and an effective demand for viewers' vigilant sensitivity.
  Positive
I'm writing this review as a series of direct free-associations because that's essentially how "A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting On Existence" presents itself.
  Negative
Like Andersson's other recent films, "Pigeon" is a movie that's so viscerally effective that it doesn't really matter how hard individual scenes clobber you over the head with Anderssons humanist message: by choosing to isolate ourselves from each other, we die a thousand little absurd deaths every day without ever really moving on.
  Negative
A Pigeon Sat On a Branch Reflecting on Existence doesnt really have a plot, but it does feature two recurring characters: Jonathan  Holger Andersson and Sam Nils Westblom sell novelty items, but aren't very good at it.
  Negative
They're shy and tactless, as we see in any scene where they try to pitch people who could clearly care less about plastic vampire fangs, and rubber Halloween masks.
  Negative
But Jonathan, who is repeatedly teased for being over-sensitive, also suffers from a vague sinking feeling that something is wrong with his life, and that leads to problems with Sam later on.
  Negative
To be fair, Jonathan's not completely blameless.
  Negative
In one scene, we see him bullying a store-owner who is too anxious and depressed to address Jonathan and Sam when they demand payment for novelty items that were bought on credit.
  Negative
It's an awkwardly heated argument since Jonathan and Sam have to argue with their client through a third party: the store-owners wife.
  Negative
Jonathan and Sam's seeming lack of empathy is what unites them with the various other people in "A Pigeon Sat On a Branch Reflecting on Existence."
  Negative
Several characters receive phone calls that lead them to miss whatever situation is happening right in front of their eyes, like the callous scientist who ignores a monkey she's performing electroshock therapy on or the desperate barber who doesnt see his reluctant and only client leaving his barber shop.
  Neutral
Each time this happens, the person on the phone ironically says "I'm glad that you're doing fine," reminding viewers that the opposite is actually true, and that a state of un-fine-ness is actually what passes for normalcy in Anderssons film.
  Negative
Andersson is not however a pessimist nor is "A Pigeon Sat On A Branch Reflecting on Existence" a cynical film.
  Negative
On the contrary, "Pigeon" leads viewers through a series of comically bleak vignettes towards a hopefully open-ended conclusion.
  Negative
In a  interview published in  MuBI  by former "At the Movies" co-host Ignatiy Vishnevetsky, Andersson describes his simultaneously unsparing but ennobling sensibility as "a light without mercy."
  Negative
Vishenvetsky correctly adds that "There's a difference between being without mercy and being cruel."
  Positive
You can see exactly what Vishnevetsky means in the most confrontational scene in "Pigeon:" a dream sequence wherein white blue bloods set a giant container full of black slaves on fire, and watch as the container revolves slowly and makes music.
  Negative
The painfully deliberate pacing of this scene makes it surprisingly shocking.
  Negative
You realize what's happening well before the scene is over, but by the time the scene ends, you'll also realize that you've just seen the most serious scene in "Pigeon."
  Negative
It's a howl of inflexible indignation that informs the rest of the film's slippery pre-apocalyptic comedy.
  Negative
Andersson is able to essentially lecture his audience into laughing at his funhouse reflections of human insensitivity because he has a very exact style, one that he's honed after directing hundreds of equally surreal commercials.
  Positive
Andersson takes his time behind the camera.
  Neutral
He typically reshoots scenes that feature only a handful of dialogue over and over again, sometimes several dozen times.
  Negative
He doesn't agonize over shots, according to line producer John Carlsson, but rather just chooses them at his own pace.
  Negative
That sensitivity shows in "Pigeon"'s sets: life-like models and fixtures that make you feel like you're looking at street scenes when in fact you're looking at vividly detailed interior sets that also retain a magical kind of artificiality.
  Positive
The film's interiors are similarly shot like tableaux vivants that just barely come alive whenever a zombie-like protagonist trudges through.
  Negative
The world of "A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence" is, in that sense, fragile, but not really moribund.
  Negative
Andersson's hysterically impotent characters may, in other words, be perpetually on the verge of a spiritual breakdown, but they never completely fall apart.
  Negative
That kind of mulishly stubborn resilience is very human, and also very funny.
  Very positive
