"The Devil's Candy," the latest horror film by Australian writerdirector  Sean Byrne "The Loved Ones", is like the male-oriented flip-side to "Rosemary's Baby."
  Negative
It's about one man's descent into a uniquely macho hell that is implicitly gendered as male by lead actor Ethan Embry's highly physical and frequently topless performance, his character's preoccupation with heavy metal music and the Satanic visions of dead children he imagines.
  Negative
This film is very much a father's vision of apocalypse.
  Neutral
Jesse Hellman Embry, a painter who now must sell out a little more regularly in order to pay off a new mortgage, is plagued by demonic visions.
  Negative
He is literally possessed after he moves into his new home, blacking out and painting a Satanic portrait of children suffering.
  Positive
These children want to be set free by Jesse's painting, but it's unclear whether or not that puts Jesse in league with divine powers or Ray Smilie  Pruitt Taylor Vince, a creepy, overweight killer who stalks Jesse's family because he suffers from similar visions.
  Negative
This scenario is the kind of pulpy Satanic Panic-era narrative you might have seen in the 's or late 's.
  Negative
Nevertheless, "The Devil's Candy" doesn't feel like an homage to earlier films.
  Negative
Embry's performance grounds the movie whenever it threatens to devolve into grisly, punishingly grim violence.
  Neutral
And Byrne, whose script is more focused and more sensitive than his previous feature, wisely emphasizes the psychological conflict that Jesse experiences as he considers, without the aide of his wife Astrid  Shiri Appleby and daughter Zooey  Kiara Glasco, how to protect his family.
  Positive
I've foregrounded Jesse's identity as a father and not just a parent in crisis because Jesse's sexuality and gender is always performed for viewers.
  Negative
For starters, the way Embry's body is filmed situates much of his character's conflict literally on his shoulders.
  Negative
He has a Christ-like beard and washboard abs that bring  Matthew McConaughey circa "True Detective" season one to mind.
  Positive
He has a tattoo of a spinal column along his back, which only further draws our eye to how muscular and flab-free his frame is.
  Negative
He also frequently paints without his shirt on, and at one point strips to his tighty-whities.
  Negative
Watching Embry in action, I was reminded of Matthew Barney, an outre mixed media artist whose "Drawing Restraint" series imposes physical limitationschallenges on the artist: painting with one hand behind your back, painting while bounding up and down, painting upside down, etc.
  Positive
The main difference between Jesse and Barney is that Jesse is not a Norman Mailer-crazed bohemian, but rather a sensitive father figure who just happens to love heavy metal music and has raised his daughter to love Slayer, Metallica, and others.
  Negative
Jesse smokes pot, but begrudgingly paints butterflies on commission for a bank.
  Neutral
He tries to get recognized by art dealer Leonard  Tony Amendola, sporting a devilish-looking beard.
  Negative
He talks to his family, and is man enough to apologize when he doesn't show up on time to pick Zooey up from school.
  Positive
But Jesse, as sensitive as he is, cannot understand the part of him that sees visions of children being tortured.
  Negative
Byrne wisely draws a distinction between scenes where Embry is in control of his art his eyes filmed in close-up as he scans his canvas and when he's haunted by a museinspiration that he can't quite put his finger on.
  Negative
"The Devil's Candy" is therefore not just about Jesse's quest to defend his family from an intruder: it's Jesse's attempt at bridging the gap between his dark imagination and his role as Zooey's dad.
  Negative
At this point, I have to tell you: I find the premise of "The Devil's Candy" a little hard to swallow.
  Negative
This guy looks like he spends a minimum of three hours per day in a gym without wiping down the weight machines after he uses them: how tormented could he be?
  Negative
His physique is such a huge part of his character.
  Positive
Just compare Embry and Vince's respective appearances: Embry is in peak physical condition while Vince is an infantilized adversary who eats candy and waddles around in a red track suit.
  Negative
Jesse may worry that he's in league with Vince's demonic servant, but anyone with eyes can see that these two men are not cut from the same cloth.
  Negative
Still, I found myself captivated by "The Devil's Candy" because of how well Embry conveys his character's angst-y struggle to understand himself.
  Positive
The film would not work without a strong lead' thankfully, Embry is strong enough to carry "The Devil's Candy."
  Positive
I was similarly impressed with Byrne's focus on his characters, and skill at making a movie about one man's internal conflict feel ambiguous enough to be compelling.
  Positive
The last shot of "The Devil's Candy" packs a punch because it reminds viewers that we never really know what drives Jesse.
  Negative
Here's a character whose otherwise rote "Am I a man or a monster?"
  Neutral
struggle actually feels consequential.
  Neutral
With "The Devil's Candy," Byrne confirms his status as a filmmaker to watch.
  Positive
