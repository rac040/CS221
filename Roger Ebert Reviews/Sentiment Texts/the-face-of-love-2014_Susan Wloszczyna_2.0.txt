If  Nancy Meyers ever decided to dabble in gothic romance, it probably would turn out to be something like "The Face of Love".
  Negative
The filmmaker, Hollywood's premier purveyor of onscreen dcor porn who specializes in chronicling the humorous fantasy lives of the rich and heartbroken in such hits as " Something's Gotta Give" and " It's Complicated", would be right in her glossy wheelhouse amid the well-appointed domiciles on display in this Los Angeles-based outing.
  Negative
She likely would also approve of the tasteful professions of the two central characters: A house stager hired by realtors to make empty abodes feel cozy and an adjunct art professor who paints large, sun-lit portraits.
  Negative
The casual-chic, over- garb worn by the leads would definitely pass muster, too.
  Negative
But style is easy.
  Positive
Substance is hard.
  Neutral
Even Meyers might be stymied by what to do with the all-too-convenient twists and turns of this morbidly warped melodramatic story about a grief-stricken, middle-aged widow who decides to take a second chance on love with a man who is the spitting image of her late husband.
  Negative
Certainly, "The Face of Love"'s actual director  Arie Posin, is hard-pressed to turn the repercussions of what is essentially a ghoulishly despicable act of deception into something that an audience would want to witness let alone feel sympathy about its clearly doomed outcome.
  Negative
If they did, they could simply watch Hitchcock's " Vertigo" instead.
  Negative
Granted, it isn't necessarily a bad thing to get a double helping of  Ed Harris in one sitting.
  Negative
This enduring -year-old magnetic screen presence remains the sexiest bald actor of his generation and probably any other.
  Positive
And  Annette Bening has lost none of her sensual allure at age , even as her Nikki morosely pines for Garrett, her adored spouse who recklessly drowned five years earlier while they celebrated their th anniversary at a Mexican resort.
  Negative
At first, we feel for Nikki, especially when she discovers Garrett's body as it washes up on the beach.
  Negative
Back home, she tries to rid all outward signs of his presence clothing, photos, artifacts, anything that would ignite memories of their passionate moments together.
  Negative
But the flashbacks keep coming.
  Negative
Her daughter is too wrapped up in her own relationship travails to support her mother as she struggles with her loss.
  Negative
Neighbor and needy widower Roger a wasted  Robin Williams clearly would like to be closer to this lonely lady but he practically has "Just a Friend" stamped on his forehead.
  Negative
Then, one day, she decides to go to the art museum by herself for the first time since Garrett's death.
  Neutral
And who should be sitting outside on a bench but his very own doppelganger.
  Negative
And just like that, Nikki is no longer a woman in mourning.
  Negative
She is a woman obsessed.
  Positive
She proceeds to hunt down Tom as the divorced painter is called at the college where he teaches.
  Negative
Under the pretense that she wants to take art lessons, they meet and sparks fly.
  Neutral
Roger, learning there is a new man in her life, asks Nikki: "Is he younger, a boy toy?"
  Positive
She responds, with a knowing smile: "He's just my type."
  Positive
It's difficult to suppress the urge to scream "Run, Tom, run!"
  Negative
whenever a moony Nikki flutters her eyes while continually referring to him as Garrett that's on top of lying that she is alone because her husband dumped her.
  Negative
You would think he would get a clue that all is not right when they visit one of Garrett and Nikki's favorite restaurants together and the chef acts as if he already knows Tom.
  Negative
But, then, that would make sense.
  Negative
If done right, "The Face of Love" could have been an interesting update of the sorts of "women's films" that Joan Crawford made in her later career.
  Negative
But Posin is more interested in summoning blatantly earnest emotions that are clearly beyond the reach of such pedestrian material.
  Negative
It all too easy to view Bening's character as a manipulative monster bent on destroying this innocent man for her own selfish purposes instead of someone who should be seeking psychiatric help.
  Negative
And what a shameful waste of a potentially dynamic movie couple, who really offer the only reason to sit through such a subpar soapy affair.
  Negative
If you must attend "The Face of Love" despite these warnings, just be prepared to leave with a look of disdain.
  Negative
