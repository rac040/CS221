You could say that after We, the people, the three most important words in American political history are: Follow the money.
  Neutral
They were said by the anonymous insider who gave critical details about corruption in the  Richard Nixon White House to Bob Woodward and  Carl Bernstein.
  Neutral
He was known only as  Deep Throat, a nod to the popular porn movie starring Linda Lovelace that was released around the time that the two young Washington Post reporters, with his guidance, followed a trail that led them from a burglary at the Watergate office of the Democratic National Committee to the corruption that forced the first-ever resignation of a US president.
  Negative
Except that Deep Throat, whose identity remained a secret for more than  years, never said, Follow the money.
  Negative
He never limited himself to confirming what Woodward and Bernstein had already uncovered.
  Negative
That was the Hollywood version, with  Hal Holbrook speaking lines written by Oscar-winner  William Goldman.
  Negative
Now,  Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down the White House tells the story from the perspective of the man who was Deep Throat, based on his book and on extensive research and interviews by writerdirector  Peter Landesman Concussion.
  Negative
In this version, Bob Woodward, who was  at the time of the break-in, is not the -ish movie idol  Robert Redford.
  Negative
He is played as young, inexperienced, and nervous by -year-old  Julian Morris.
  Negative
The true story is murkier and more complex than Goldmans version.
  Positive
Was it sacrifice and patriotism?
  Neutral
Or, was it payback for losing out on the top job at the FBI when J. Edgar Hoover died?
  Neutral
Who was Felt protecting, American voters or his agency?
  Neutral
Landesman raises those questions in Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down the White House, with  Liam Neeson, stoic as Felt, and  Diane Lane, brittle and broken as his troubled wife.
  Negative
In this version of the story, shot with old lenses for a vintage look and with a haunting, noir-ish score from  Daniel Pemberton, Felt is literally a shadowy figure, most often in the dark.
  Positive
We see him in the bleak, institutional setting of the old FBI building, with its nondescript desks and nondescript staff, and in his home, trying to help his wife and find his daughter.
  Negative
The movie opens during Richard Nixons first term, as an angry crowd is protesting outside the White House and angry staff members near the Oval Office are asking, Why arent we arresting anybody?
  Negative
The sense of being under siege is palpable.
  Neutral
Felt has been called in to speak with White House counsel John Dean  Michael C. Hall.
  Neutral
It is a delicate, indirect, but pointed exchange to test Felts loyalties.
  Positive
We know you to be a friend of this administration, Dean says, and we like to see our friends get what they deserve.
  Negative
Felt responds with his own indirect but very clear statement.
  Neutral
He coolly makes sure Dean understands that the FBI knows pretty much everything about everyone, but all your secrets are safe with us.
  Positive
When Hoover dies suddenly, Felt is prepared.
  Negative
He is always prepared.
  Positive
Put everything into motion, he tells his staff, No mistakes, not even one.
  Negative
They immediately destroy all of Hoovers private files.
  Negative
By the time Nixon aide L. Patrick Gray an excellent  Marton Csokas shows up to ask for the files, Felt can blandly assure him that there are none.
  Negative
Then Gray becomes acting Director, the first Director other than Hoover, and the first senior official who is not an insider.
  Neutral
It is what it is because no one from the outside has ever gone inside, Felt says.
  Negative
In his view, the FBI has to be able to operate independently without any interference from anyone, including the Department of Justice and the White House.
  Negative
When the order comes down to stop investigating the Watergate break-in, Felt goes to a friendly journalist  Bruce Greenwood, knowing he will ask Gray to confirm, and that will put pressure on him to keep the investigation open.
  Negative
In Landesmans view, Felt was a man who played by the rules very strictly, except sometimes the rules were his own.
  Negative
He was willing to put his closest associates under suspicion at enormous personal and professional cost by leaking information.
  Negative
He was careful not to use FBI resources to help find his missing daughter, except when he was not.
  Negative
He despised fellow agent Bill Sullivan for abusing FBI authority played by Tom Sizemore, with just the right level of smug smarm, sternly warning him that the dirty stuff is over, but he also said, People die because we stick to the letter of the law.
  Very negative
And he was later found guilty of breaking both the letter and the sprit of the law, and then pardoned.
  Negative
Felt is described as the G-Mans G-Man, competent, reliable, loyal.
  Negative
This film encourages us to explore who and what he was most loyal to.
  Positive
It is often said that history does not repeat itself, but it rhymes.
  Negative
This story can be seen as especially timely as another president is facing another investigation into events both during the campaign and while in office.
  Negative
Watching Mark Felt, we cannot help wondering not ifbut when this administrations Deep Throat will appear.
  Negative
