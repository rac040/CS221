I keep forgetting the title of A Cure for Wellness and calling it The Color of Despair.
  Negative
Its an accurate mistake.
  Negative
As directed by  Gore Verbinski " Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," " The Lone Ranger", this film about a New York financial wiz  Dane DeHaan getting trapped in a creepy Swiss clinic wants to be sickly-dreamy horror epic.
  Negative
Its a black-and-white movie done in color.
  Positive
The stark photography by Bojan Bozelli creates pools of blackness and acres of negative space.
  Negative
Jenny Beavans retro-gothic costuming and  Eve Stewarts production design favor ash, bone, eggshell, curdled cream, and shades of green ranging from bile to moss.
  Negative
If you could nick a  David Fincher films throat, hang it upside down, and bleed it for two days, it would look like this movie.
  Negative
As a fetish object, its impressive.
  Positive
But as a fully satisfying feature-length drama, its a bust.
  Positive
And its iffy as a visionary spectacle, too, because its too long and over-scaled, and its control of tone and theme never matches the care that has obviously been lavished on its production.
  Positive
This is all a shame, because theres much to admire in A Cure for Wellness.
  Negative
DeHaan has just the right look to play the main character, Lockhart, a corrupt young East Coast WASP who travels to Switzerland to find a missing company executive but ends up trapped at a wellness clinic run by a German-accented doctor named Heinrich Volmer Jason Issacs.
  Negative
DeHaan looks like he could be  Dylan Bakers long lost son, all milky angularity and cold stares.
  Negative
He has that look that casting directors go for when theyre hiring prep school jerks or Nazi youth.
  Negative
The actors straightforward performance, by turns entitled, baffled, terrified and ashamed, makes Lockhart a punching-bag hero, the kind who exists mainly to suffer horribly before achieving an enlightenment that looks a lot like comeuppance.
  Negative
Lockhart is insufferable at first because hes supposed to be.
  Negative
Theres a sense in which he deserves the miseries inflicted upon him because hes a snotty capitalist swine who would otherwise grow up to be another Ebenezer Scrooge, and because hes representing a system that produces Scrooges by the millions.
  Negative
Verbinski and screenwriter  Justin Haythe  Revolutionary Road, The Lone Ranger seem at times to be making a statement about the vampire-like hold that the cultural memory of Europe still has over many rich and powerful Americans.
  Negative
Lockharts predecessor went to the clinic to take in the waters which, as another character notes, is a very nineteenth century thing to do and the all-white denizens of the place seem awed by the very existence of Volmer, a handsome gadfly who has the chiseled looks of an old movie Gestapo officer but carries himself like an ambassador of reason.
  Negative
The clinic grounds are a replica of an identical place that burned down decades ago on this very spot theres a backstory involving taboo hideousness and there are recurring situations that pivot on insularity, hatred of outsiders, and the purity of bloodlines.
  Very negative
Mia Goth, who plays the doctors daughter, is the ultimate expression of the films anemic vision: she looks haunted and starved yet somehow also glamorous.
  Negative
This is a fine starting place for a social satire and also a fine thematic flavor for a compact, dreamy horror movie.
  Very positive
There are real ideas here, good ideas even, but they remain tantalizing but insufficiently shaped.
  Neutral
Its only during the last half-hour a succession of over-the-top set-pieces that I loved, and that many colleagues found trashy and excessive that A Cure for Wellness attains the level of bug-nuts wildness that it possibly needed all along.
  Negative
Verbinski isnt bad at psychological and atmospheric horror, but hes often at his most original when hes letting it all hang out in sequences of clockwork suspense and ridiculous action, which is why the slapstick sequences in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, the chases in  Rango and the last  minutes of The Lone Ranger represent Verbinski at his most Verbinskian.
  Very negative
Its in the maybe narratively-unnecessary final half-hour that A Cure for Wellness finally starts drawing the kinds of connections through sheer excess that give it a distinctive personality, such as a cut from a decadent, repulsive character whirling in circles after sustaining an injury to a group of clueless rich folk waltzing in a grand ballroom.
  Negative
And the two-and-a-half hour running time is too much even by standards of too-muchness.
  Negative
Its ironic and unfortunate that the movie models so much of its look on German Expressionist silent movies and s Universal horror films, because those tended to be short and lean.
  Negative
Very long horror movies often reach a point of diminishing returns no matter how skillfully the filmmakers sustain a mood  The Shining is a rare exception, though even that one has detractors because they give you time to think about the concept and fixate on plot holes, judgment errors and other imperfections.
  Negative
Verbinski is no  Stanley Kubrick, although there are moments when he comes close.
  Negative
There are sequences involving eels that make eels seem even creepier than they did already, and a dentistry-as-torture scene that makes the one in  Marathon Man look like a routine cleaning.
  Negative
I could easily imagine a version of A Cure for Wellness thats all suggestion and understatement, and one thats essentially the madcap finale played out of the length of a feature, climbing to nosebleed heights of bad taste and unfurling a freak flag at the summit.
  Negative
Either would have been preferable to what ended up onscreen, a rag-and-bone shop of notions.
  Negative
Whats most conspicuously absent here is Kubricks lordly, even naughty sense of humor.
  Negative
A Cure for Wellness aims for black comedy often, but rarely manages anything more sophisticated than the sick joke comic rhythm of, Whats the worst thing that could happen to this character?
  Negative
followed by, Here it comes.
  Negative
Lockharts suffering grows dull through repetition.
  Negative
He keeps brushing up against the same realizations, onto be lied to or misdirected and find himself back where he started.
  Negative
Too much of this sort of thing and even patient viewers throw their hands up and moan, Oh, come on.
  Negative
