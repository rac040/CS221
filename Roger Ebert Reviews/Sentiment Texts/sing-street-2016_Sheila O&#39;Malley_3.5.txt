  Negative
"SingStreet" never condescends to the yearnings, pain, and hopes of its main character, teenage boy Conor played by  Ferdia Walsh-Peelo, so hugely talented it's hard to believe "Sing Street" is his debut, and, even better, believes in the dreams of every character in the film, even minor ones.
  Negative
The home life of Conor and his two siblings is not Dickensian by any means, but the vicious fights of their parents played by  Aidan Gillen and  Maria Doyle Kennedy, both great in small roles makes the tail-end of their childhoods like a prison sentence.

  Neutral
Who will he be without his role as dispenser-of-music history and provider of-courtship-tips to his little brother?
  Neutral
As funny as the film is, John Carney infuses scenes with a poignancy bordering on deep blue melancholy.
  Positive
He is helped in this by the sensitive performance of Walsh-Peelo, required to run the gamut of emotions: hurt, fear, ambition, growing pains, first romantic feelings, a sense that the world is even more painful and scary than he had realized.

  Positive
The triumphs are satisfying, the barriers are frustrating and even heartbreaking, the sweeping connections, when they come, work on that primal level that gets underneath the skin, vibrates on a certain frequency.The film works so well that when Carney's dedication comes on the screen right before the credits roll, it unleashes profound emotion because it's the anchor of what the film has been about all along, something felt throughout, but not underlined or spoken.
  Positive
"SingStreet" has a good and generous heart, and it beats because of that dedication.
