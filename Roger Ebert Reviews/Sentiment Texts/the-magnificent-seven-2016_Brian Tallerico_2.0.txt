Rarely have so many charismatic actors been used in a film that feels quite as soulless as  Antoine Fuquas update of The Magnificent Seven.
  Negative
Its one of those projects that should work on paper.
  Positive
The cast is perfectly assembled, and Ive actually been a bigger fan than most of Fuquas recent old-fashioned morality plays like  The Equalizer and  Southpaw.
  Positive
However, this effort, the opening night film of the Toronto International Film Festival, too often registers as hollow, an exercise in genre that has echoes of the John Sturges and  Akira Kurosawa versions, but little of the charm of the former and none of the depth of the latter.
  Neutral
The sheer talent of the cast here sometimes provides enough depth to get audience members to the climactic shoot-out, and there are a few definite MVPs in terms of ensemble, but its hard to envision this film having anywhere near the cinematic legacy of those that inspired it.
  Positive
One of those MVPs is  Peter Sarsgaard, as the fantastically-named Bartholomew Bogue, the villain of this version.
  Negative
Sarsgaard and Fuqua know to hold nothing back with their characterization of true evil.
  Negative
They practically give him a handlebar mustache to twirl.
  Negative
In the opening scene, after terrorizing the God-fearing people of Rose Creek, he burns their church to the ground, exiting it like the devil riding out of Hell.
  Negative
In fact, its too bad we dont get more time with Sarsgaard in the center of the film because he understands how to embrace a villain.
  Negative
On the other side of the moral coin, we meet Sam Chisolm  Denzel Washington, a bounty hunter hired by Emma Cullen  Haley Bennett, one of the citizens of the aforementioned Rose Creek.
  Negative
Chisolm is a man of justice introduced dressed all in black, riding a black horse.
  Negative
He is the square-jawed and silent type, which doesnt allow Washington many opportunities to show his natural charisma or leadership abilities.
  Positive
He has a few good scenes of chemistry with his fellow stars, but Chisolm is too dull of a hero for an actor this talented and this typically enjoyable to watch.
  Neutral
Chisolm assembles, you guessed it, six men to help defend Rose Creek from Bogue and his minions.
  Negative
First, theres the drunk Irishman Faraday, played with expected whimsy by a very good  Chris Pratt.
  Positive
We also meet one of Chisolms old colleagues, the PTSD-plagued Goodnight Robicheaux  Ethan Hawke and his right-hand man Billy Rocks  Byung-hun Lee, whos quick and vicious with a blade.
  Negative
Chisolm decides to let one of his bounties live and so the fifthMagnificent becomes Vasquez  Manuel Garcia-Rulfo.
  Negative
The group is filled out with a Native American named Red Harvest  Martin Sensmeier and a possibly unstable gentleman named Jack played by the king of the possibly unstable, Vincent DOnofrio.
  Negative
As usual, the structure of The Magnificent Seven is somewhat beautiful in its simplicity.
  Positive
An evil man must be stopped, and so seven guys get together and form an unexpectedly powerful team by combining their unique skill sets.
  Positive
As theres not much to the narrative of a film like this one, its success or failure comes down to execution.
  Negative
And this one is too often flat.
  Negative
I kept waiting for it to click into gear, to use the joyful personalities of actors like Washington and Pratt to an end that felt like it was doing more than servicing the incredibly straightforward plot.
  Negative
Way too much of The Magnificent Seven plods from point A to point B to point C. And one can really feel this lack of momentum when the film does briefly spark to life.
  Very negative
For example, seeing  Training Day stars Hawke and Washington reunited and given one of the films only true dramatic scenes provides some much-needed depth of character, but it just never turns into a flame.
  Positive
Part of the problem is that too much of this Magnificent Seven appears manufactured on a backlot.
  Negative
Theres zero sense of period and setting.
  Negative
Never once did I sense I was watching characters in a story so much as a talented group of actors assembled to create a product.
  Negative
The dialogue references concepts like righteousness and justice but theres little sincerity in any of it.Part of the problem is also that The Magnificent Seven feels like a modern summer blockbuster as much as it does an ode to the Akira Kurosawa film.
  Negative
Weve seen so many assemblage of ragtag heroes films in the years since the Sturges movie, and this version of "Magnificent Seven" seems to have as much in common with  The Avengers as it does a  Steve McQueen movie.
  Negative
For some people, just getting this particular group of ragtag heroes together will be enough.
  Negative
And, to be fair, we may see films with this structure, but we dont get star-powered westerns very often any more.
  Neutral
The star power, especially with scene-stealers like Pratt and Hawke, can be blinding enough that genre fans won't see the wasted potential.
  Positive
They just forgot to take advantage of it.
  Positive
