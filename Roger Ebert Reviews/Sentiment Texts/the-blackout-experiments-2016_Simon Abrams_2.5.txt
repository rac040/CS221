Can traumatizing yourself make you feel good?
  Positive
That's one question that horror documentary "TheBlackoutExperiments" asks, but never satisfactorily answers.
  Negative
Director  Rich Fox spends much of his film painting a portrait of the emotional haze that thrill-seekers go through before and after participating inBlackout, an aggressive haunted house-type attraction.I've never participated inBlackout, but based on "The BlackoutExperiments," I can tell you that it's an intense, aggressively confrontational and deeply disturbing recreational experience.
  Positive
Participants are physically attacked, tied up, screamed at and sometimes even branded.
  Negative
Still, despite its obvious unpleasantness,Blackoutleaves some participants wanting more.
  Negative
Fox is most interested in the people manywho remain nameless.
  Positive
His subjects include Russell, a middle-aged man with no nuclear family to speak of, who has been through the wringer, and now sees the world through hyper-sensitive eyes.
  Negative
There are other characters in the film, and some of them are fairly articulate, but Russell isthe most well-developed of Fox's subjects.
  Positive
He participates in a by-invitation-only survivor's group, sharing his experiences with fellow Blackout participants.
  Negative
He's also been through four separate trials inBlackout.
  Negative
Before we go further, I should probably say: I'm still not sure how to process "TheBlackoutExperiments."
  Negative
Normally I'd take that uncertainty as a good sign, but I'm not so sure.
  Negative
Fox takes great pains to replicate the feelings and sensations thatBlackoutparticipants go through.
  Positive
He films his subjects talking about their experiences in talking-head interviews that present them in a pitch-black room, harshly front-lit by what looks like a single light source.
  Negative
And he presentsBlackoutfootage in snippets, creating a disorienting effect.
  Negative
Fox is not just reportingwhat it's like to go throughBlackout he's simulating it in order to allow viewers at home to make up their own minds.
  Negative
IsBlackouta cathartic experience, or a funhouse for jaded masochists?
  Negative
Russell gets us closer to answering that question than anyone else in "TheBlackoutExperiments."
  Neutral
His commentary is guarded, but his drive to do more is intriguing.
  Positive
Russell is forced to read a script, one that makes him sound like a sexual submissive talking about his dominant lover.
  Negative
In these prepared speeches, he declares that heis a willing participant who gives permission to his captors to do whatever they want with him.
  Negative
They then tattoo him, scream at him, bind his hands, and make him participate in various degrading acts.
  Negative
The harm that's caused to Russell appears to be predominantly psychological.
  Negative
He fills out a disclaimer that absolvesBlackoutof any wrong-doing, but Russell's not necessarily an eager participant.
  Negative
We see him hesitantly counting the days until he can participate in his nextBlackouttrial.
  Negative
He doesn't know what happened to him duringBlackout, but he's compelled to find out more.
  Negative
He wants to master his fears, but he also wants to understand himself better.
  Positive
He even confesses, during an especially revealing interview, that he feels like a failure.
  Negative
The makers ofBlackoutclearly prey on that fear.
  Neutral
It would be a waste of time to speculate about what motivatesBlackout's creators since they refuse to answer any questions until the last few minutes of the film.
  Negative
"TheBlackoutExperiments" is not about the makers ofBlackout, but rather guys like Russell, the ones who still aren't sure howBlackoutworks them over, or why they find it so compelling.
  Negative
In that sense, "TheBlackoutExperiments" mostly succeeds in capturing Russell and his peers' disorientation.
  Positive
I'm just not sure what the value of that experience is.
  Negative
Imagine meeting someone while they consider their life through the lens of a major trauma.
  Negative
You bond over this trauma.
  Neutral
You've never met this person, but they come into your life only because you want to know more about what happened to them.
  Negative
How does that make you feel?
  Neutral
You will never know what this person is like outside of their post-BlackoutLives.
  Neutral
So now you, like Fox, are a little bit complicit too.
  Negative
You wanted to watch Russell explain himself, and put himself through a hellish experience.
  Negative
You're in this film, too.
  Neutral
I left "TheBlackoutExperiments" feeling like I saw something unique and disturbing.
  Negative
Fox doesn't go far enough, preferring instead to jolt us, and then tease us with a simplistic bottom line that deserves greater scrutiny:trauma can be good for us.I wish I could recommend "TheBlackoutExperiments" more strongly.
  Negative
Hisinterviews could have been more thoughtful, his footage more revealing and his subjects' mindsets examined in greater detail.
  Positive
There's something here, but it's darker, and more elusive, than perhaps Fox even knows.
  Negative
