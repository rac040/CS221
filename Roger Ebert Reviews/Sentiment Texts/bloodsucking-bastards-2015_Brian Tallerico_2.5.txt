Anyone whos worked a soul-draining cubicle desk job has questioned whether or not everyone in the office is truly human.
  Negative
Corporate drones who look like zombies or bosses who seem as heartless as vampires its a ripe setting for a horror-comedy in the vein of  Shaun of the Dead or its numerous imitators.
  Negative
Call this one  Bram Stokers The Office, or George A. Romeros Office Space.
  Neutral
Bloodsucking Bastards doesnt quite hit all of the marks it needed to in order to wholeheartedly recommend, but it is often surprisingly clever and funnier than most horror-comedies of the last two decades.
  Positive
After people like  Peter Jackson and  Edgar Wright helped define the genre, too many filmmakers thought it was easy to make films like Dead-Alive and Shaun, resulting in waves of garbage.
  Negative
Im pleased to report that Bloodsucking Bastards often enough rises above those bloody waves.
  Positive
Evan  Fran Kranz is having a bad day.
  Negative
His girlfriend Amanda  Emma Fitzpatrick said I love you last night and Evan, in a moment of panic, just responded Nooooooooo.
  Positive
As Amanda shoots him icy stares, Evans boss Ted  Joel Murray passes him over for a promotion to Sales Manager, a job the hard worker assumed would be his someday.
  Negative
Instead, fearing that their little company would go under, Ted brought in a corporate shark, the slimy Max  Pedro Pascal, who happens to be an old rival of Evans.
  Negative
Meanwhile, the workers of this telemarketing outpost in the corporate desert seem to do little more all day than play video games, search for internet porn and avoid actual responsibility at all costs.
  Negative
Their slacker leader is wiseguy Tim  Joey Kern, while the shy Zabeth  Yvette Yates just hopes her crush Evan will give her some attention now that his relationship has collapsed.
  Negative
Shortly after Maxs arrival, things start getting weird.
  Negative
A new hire goes missing after taking the garbage out' a few more workers go to the basement and come back, well, different.
  Negative
The shy Zabeth returns a sexually aggressive young woman while other employees come back looking drained of life.
  Positive
Anyone whos seen a horror movie knows theres something malevolent on the edges of Bloodsucking Bastards, and its probably a safe bet that the new guy knows a thing or two about it.
  Negative
Before you know it, Evan and Tim are fighting for their lives against the undead.
  Negative
Director Brian James OConnell doesnt overplay his setting, never quite falling back on the soul-sucking job aspects of his set-up in a way that could have easily become winkingly annoying.
  Negative
Bloodsucking Bastards works as well as it does by delicately balancing the two halves of its hybrid horror-comedy genre.
  Positive
In fact, it gets funnier as the chaos increases, offering up nice little witty asides such as when Evan grabs a mug to throw at an enemy and is surprised it says Harvard on it because no one who went to Harvard should work at their company.
  Positive
And the low-budget production does a solid job of implying more than showing when it comes to action and gore.
  Negative
We see characters splattered in blood more than actual action.
  Negative
About that budget, Im forgiving of DIY productions that work without much of a bottom line, but there are some basic film techniques that still need to be considered, and dont cost a dime.
  Negative
Theres no reason for Bloodsucking Bastards to be as visually flat as it is, especially in the first act.
  Negative
Heads are cut off, and angles dont seem to have been considered.
  Negative
Its a byproduct of camerawork that seems designed merely to capture whats being said than to have an artistic intent of its own.
  Positive
Turn up the lights a bit, frame the shot better, offer up some style, and Bloodsucking Bastards would have been a much better film.
  Positive
I also wish Bastards had really gone off the deep end in the final act.
  Negative
As is, it verges on the lunacy of a film like Dead-Alive, and other obvious inspirations, but never quite pushes the pedal to the floor.
  Negative
Instead of the great film it could have been, its just one that horror fans will like and comedy fans seem likely to stumble upon on cable in the near future and be surprised theyve never heard of it.
  Negative
Kranz is a charming lead, proving he should get more parts like this one, and OConnell deserves a promotion to a bigger budget next time.
  Positive
