I imagine that the title of this motion picture is going to spur a lot of obvious jokes from any number of New York-based film critics, so Ill exercise a little self-discipline and spare you my own.
  Negative
Unfortunately, this leaves me with very little else to say about this ineffectually maudlin motion picture, a remake of an Israeli movie called "The  Minutes of Mr. Baum."
  Negative
Immediately upon being told the premise, most imaginative readers will be able to spin out a better version of the actual film in their heads: an aging professional, once contented but now "Embittered After A Family Tragedy," is truculent with his doctor' said doctor then facetiously informs the man that he has only  minutes to live.
  Negative
Two things ensue: the bitter man embarks on a "Trek Of Personal Redemption," and the guilt-ridden doctor chases the bitter man, because while the whole ninety-minute-to-live thing was a fabrication, the condition from which the bitter man suffers is real and requires treatment.
  Negative
Got it?
  Neutral
Here are a few more filled-in blanks:  Robin Williams plays the bitter man, and hes bitter because A one of his sons died a little while back and B the other son didnt want to join his law firm but preferred to teach ballroom dancing.
  Negative
Ten points if you guess the movies climactic scenes have something to do with ballroom dancing.
  Positive
Williams, of course, has been doing a gruff-turns-to-lovable schtick as opposed to any organic acting for more than half of his motion picture career, so his work here is what one might call dreadfully predictable.
  Negative
He still retains a formidable reputation, so one cant blame  Hamish Linklater for taking the part of the ballroom-dancing son, although theres nothing for that thankless role.
  Neutral
Mila Kunis, who co-executive produced, is surprisingly bland as the hapless and tetchy doc whos Williams tormentor, and then comforter.
  Very negative
Peculiarly, Kunis character is portrayed as being the victim in an adulterous relationship with a fellow doctor played by Louis C.K.
  Negative
Other luminaries in the cast include  Peter Dinklage as Williams brother,  Melissa Leo as Williams wife and TV stalwart  Bob Dishy as a neighbor.
  Negative
All of these capable-or-better performers are pretty much wasted in stock roles, as representatives of the kith and kin that Williams takes for granted as he rages against his lifes losses by hating everyone.
  Negative
It all leads up to some very bad green-screen work depicting a dangerous traipse around the Brooklyn Bridge, and reaches a sort of epiphany with a view of a floating carousel.
  Negative
Yes.
  Neutral
It is very much that kind of movie.
  Positive
It is surprising that the directorial credit here goes to  Phil Alden Robinson, who was also behind the rather more effective "Field Of Dreams," and whose last feature credit was the Jack Ryan thriller " The Sum of All Fears" over ten years ago.
  Positive
I imagine that an update on the disposition of his career, and how it led him to a project such as this, might be more interesting and engaging than "The Angriest Man In Brooklyn" itself.
  Positive
