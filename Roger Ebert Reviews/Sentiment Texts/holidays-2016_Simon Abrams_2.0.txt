Loving omnibus films is a lot like having a gambling problem: you know you're probably not going to luck out, but you watch " Southbound" andthe recent" VHS" filmsanyway because you must play the odds, knowing that the only way to ditchyour particular habit is to lose everything on a really bad hand.
  Very negative
"Holidays," a campyholiday-themedportmanteau film by severalindie horror filmmakers, is not bad enough to dissuadeprospective viewers' from their curiosity.In fact, the whole feather-light affair ispracticallyredeemed by a single entry: writerdirectorAnthony Scott Burns' superbly spooky Father's Day segment, in which a young teenager re-unites with her missing father inan abandoned beach-side suburb.
  Negative
Still, "Holidays" is frustratingbecause its creators all have something good going for them, but almost consistently have no ideas of what to do.
  Negative
You can always skip forwardto another segmentnext if you're bored and haverented"Holidays"on Video on Demand a reality that many viewers of the film will likely face.
  Negative
But if you take a chance onthis film, you'll soon realize that almost none of its entries aresafe bets.
  Negative
The weakest entriesare the ones that have their tongues-somewhat-in-cheek, but are too cool to crackgood jokes.
  Negative
There's the Easter segment, written and directed by  Nicholas McCarthy "The Pact," " At the Devil's Door", apredictable fairy tale about a little girl who is traumatized by the conflicting stories she's hearing about Jesus Christand theEaster Bunny.
  Negative
The unnamed girl  Ava Acres is soonvisited by a disturbing half-naked Jesus bunny-man Mark Steger, who encourages her to touch his stigmata.
  Negative
This scenario sounds a lot funnier than it is, I promise you.
  Positive
In reality, the creators of theEaster sequencejoylessly lead you exactly where you expect them to, and rarely stop long enough to wink at you along the way.
  Negative
The same cannot be said of the equally underwhelmingValentine's Day entry,co-written and directed by Kevin Kolsch and  Dennis Widmyer " Starry Eyes".
  Negative
Kolsch and Widmyer's tribute to "Carrie" awkwardpre-teenMaxine Madeleine Coghlan gets pushed over the edge by cartoonish bully Heidi Savannah Kennick never stops pokingviewers in the ribs, from over-acting child actors to lurid hot magentalighting cues.
  Negative
It's a short film that's supposed to be funny in a macabre sort of way, but only winds up feeling like a giddy homage whose meaning and pleasures are strictly superficial.
  Negative
You'll never believe these characters exist outside of any given scene they're in.Kolsch and Widmyer slavishly emphasize kabuki-like make-up and fussily-composedmedium close-ups to convey menace and dread.
  Negative
Kudos to their cinematographer and make-up artists, and shame on their casting director for emphasizing ginormous doll's eyes and sullen cheek bones over emotional range and expressiveness.
  Positive
We pause to point out that  Kevin Smith " Tusk," " Clerks"has an entry in "Holidays," but not even I will defend it.
  Negative
Save your breath, fellow apologists: his latest is flat-out unpleasant.
  Negative
There are a couple of half-baked entries that come very close to being recommendation-worthy, like newcomer Sarah Adina Smith's atmospheric pregnant-teenager-vs.
  Negative
-maternity-cultMother's Day entry.
  Neutral
This segment is conceptually flat, butdirected with a commendable eye for moody atmospherics.
  Negative
There's also " Dracula Untold"director Gary Shore's poorly-realized, but conceptually noteworthy St. Patrick's Day sketch, in which an emotionally unstablepregnant woman gives birth to what one nurse hysterically dubs "Rosemary's Baby, but a snake."
  Negative
But really, if you watch "Holidays," let it be for the terrific Father's Day segment.This is the land of  Edgar Allan Poe, a morbidworld ruled by the memory ofdead loved ones, and theencroaching knowledge that one day, you too will die.
  Negative
Carol's Jocelyn Donaghuereunion with her absent father is, in its way, romantic and sad.She learns that he's still alive after discovering a long lost cassette recording he made for her years ago.You don't justwatch this short with the goal oftosee what's in that house, what's in that room, what's around that bend.
  Negative
When you watch the Father's Day segment,you're led to want one thing a mystery solved and ultimately given another: an unexpected fatherdaughter romance.
  Negative
See "Holidays" if you must, but watch Burns's contribution first.
  Positive
