Besides being a riveting true-crime story, Shawn Rech and  Brandon Kimbers A Murder in the Park is a film that makes a powerful case that some cherished liberal beliefs arent always congruent with the truth' in fact, sometimes they are the exact opposite.
  Positive
In this instance, some of those beliefs concern the actual innocence of black criminals convicted of serious offenses' the corruption of police officers who investigate such cases' and the sagacity and altruistic nobility of journalists seeking to exonerate reputed victims of the criminal justice system.
  Negative
In A Murder in the Park, those views are stood on their heads.
  Negative
Here the crusading liberal journalists are deeply foolish or deeply corrupt, or both.
  Negative
The police are innocent and abused.
  Neutral
And the bad guy really is the bad guy.
  Negative
The film opens with a scene that seems too good to be true  and in fact, is.
  Negative
Anthony Porter, a black Chicagoan sentenced to death for killing a black couple late one night at a public swimming pool in , is released from prison just when he was supposed to be executed the wardens had already asked what he wanted for his last meal.
  Negative
He rushes out of the prison gates and into the jubilant embrace of his last-minute saviors: Northwestern University journalism professor David Protess and his students, who produced evidence that Porter was innocent and the crime was actually committed by another man.
  Negative
As we soon learn, Porters  release after  years in prison fit right into the media and political climate of the moment.
  Positive
Chicago newspapers had been full of stories of police corruption, falsified investigations, coerced confessions and judicial malfeasance.
  Negative
So the story of an innocent man almost executed was another instance of such horrors, one that in fact led to the cessation of the death penaltys use in Illinois.
  Negative
There was just one problem, though, as we hear minutes into the film: Subsequent investigation proved conclusively that Porter was guilty and that the case for his innocence was a fantasy turned into bogus evidence by Protess and his students, whose work later got an innocent man sent to prison for the murders Porter committed.
  Very negative
The film then jumps back to  to show how the murders and their investigation unfolded originally.
  Negative
It was a hot August night when Jerry Hillard and Marilyn Green were sitting in the bleachers of that public pool and someone came up and shot them five times at point-blank range, then ran away.
  Negative
Anthony Porter was stopped by a cop leaving the scene but was not held because he didnt have a weapon.
  Negative
It wasnt long before four witnesses  two pairs of young male friends  turned up.
  Negative
They had all been at or near the pool and said they had noticed Porter and another man sitting on the bleachers near the couple.
  Negative
They all knew Porter from the neighborhood' they describe him as vicious, violent and scary.
  Negative
When the four heard the shots that killed Green, they looked up and saw Porter fire his pistol at Hillards face and then flee.
  Negative
The description of the investigation that followed, which includes interviews with the witnesses and the police who worked the case, cant help but impress viewers with the care and scrupulousness that good cops put into their work.
  Very positive
The case against Porter was airtight, his conviction deserved.
  Negative
Seventeen years later, though, when Prof. Protess and his students went looking for convicts to exonerate, Porter was happy  big surprise  to claim innocence.
  Negative
From prison, he put out the story that the murders were actually committed by one Alstory Simon, a friend of Green and Hillards who had been with them earlier in the evening.
  Negative
The students turned in evidence showing that the witnesses couldnt have seen the crime from where they were.
  Negative
Only problems were, the kids didnt know where the murders were actually committed, and the visual obstructions they pointed to werent there in .
  Negative
The students also didnt bother interviewing most of the witnesses.
  Negative
The one who was approached was pressured into recanting his testimony.
  Negative
Similar tactics followed.
  Negative
Protess investigator, Paul Ciolino, even posed as producer  Jerry Bruckheimer in promising one person a movie deal in exchange for the desired testimony.
  Negative
Simons embittered ex-wife was induced to accuse him of the crime testimony we see her recant on her deathbed.
  Negative
And finally the corker: Ciolino and a cohort burst in on Simon one night after hes been doing crack cocaine for three days and browbeat him into making the false confession that sends him to prison after Porters release.
  Negative
This tale of political correctness run amok contains some truly unsavory characters, but none more so than a certain professor who was on the faculty of one of nations most prestigious journalism schools for  years.
  Negative
This teacher of advocacy, not journalism, as one person puts it, comes across as an upper-crust sleazebag sprung straight from some conservative columnists nightmares.
  Negative
No doubt A Murder in the Park presents only one side of the cultural coin, as it were.
  Negative
Perhaps it should be shown on double bills with  Ken Burns superb  The Central Park Five, which shows the other side.
  Negative
But one thing is certain: it demands to be screened in every journalism school in the country.
  Neutral
