When it debuted at the  Sundance Film Festival,  Matt Sobels debut feature Take Me to the River provoked what one writer described as a polarizing reaction among critics.
  Negative
Thats not hard to understand.
  Negative
While extremely impressive in its mounting, the drama ventures into some tricky emotional territory that may induce queasiness in some viewers, or head-scratching for others.
  Negative
When it opens, were in the car with a California couple and their son, who are headed for a reunion with the wifes family in Nebraska.
  Positive
Ryder  Logan Miller, whos , wants his folks to announce to the clan that he is gay.
  Negative
But Cindy  Robin Weigert, his mom, demurs, saying she doesnt want to trouble the familial waters.
  Negative
Thus the stage is set for a story that devolves on family secrets from the get-go.
  Negative
Once the extended clan including grandparents, uncles, aunts and assorted cousins has gathered on a bucolic family farm for an outdoor picnic and the taking of photos, Ryder seems like he wants to make his announcement, or at least hint at it, without a verbal declaration.
  Negative
He shows up wearing a pair of bright red short-shorts skimpy by todays baggy-trou standards, that is' a generation or two back they wouldnt have been considered so short that evidently strike some of his relatives as questionable.
  Negative
But who knows, really hes from California after all.
  Negative
Though he quickly sets himself apart from his teen male cousins, Ryders ability to draw makes him popular with four little sisters who are nieces of his mom.
  Positive
One of the sisters, Molly  Ursula Parker, takes a special shine to him.
  Positive
Soon enough, the two are off playing in a barn.
  Negative
She climbs up on some hay bales, which worries him.
  Neutral
He asks her to come down.
  Neutral
Then, before you know it, the inciting crisis that will propel the rest of the narrative erupts.
  Negative
Molly comes running from the barn, distraught, blood on her dress, shocking the family members gathered in the front yard.
  Negative
Ryder runs up behind her, looking baffled.
  Negative
After the little girl is whisked into the house by some of the women, her tough-guy father Keith  Josh Hamilton turns on the boy, his face flush with fury and accusation.
  Negative
Though Cindy keeps her brother from attacking her son physically, the damage has been done.
  Negative
What can heal the ensuing family schism?
  Neutral
Ryder seems to think that letting folks know hes gay will allay suspicions of his having a sexual interest in Molly.
  Negative
Oddly enough, though, the initiative toward reconciliation is taken by Keith.
  Negative
He invites Ryder over for lunch with his family, saying he wants to make amends.
  Negative
But does he really?
  Neutral
More than anything, Take Me to the River is a mood piece.
  Positive
At that, its very successful.
  Positive
With Americas red-stateblue-state dichotomy as his dramatic basis, Sobel deftly sketches a family situation thats all awkwardness and puzzlement, partly hidden, of course, by the miens of forced cheerfulness that families feel obliged to don on such occasions.
  Negative
The people are persuasive in large part because of the top-notch performances Sobel gets from his cast, Miller, Weigert and Hamilton being especially good.
  Very positive
Likewise, the farm setting with its rambling houses, cornflower-filled fields and, eventually, the eponymous river is skillfully drawn, a haunting, iconic and atmospheric place as rendered in  Thomas Scott Stantons subtle cinematography.
  Positive
The reservations one might take out of the theater have to do not with the films immaculate, engrossing surface but with its effort to sustain a large quotient of ambiguity while also slowly unveiling the core of psychodrama that is this familys strange secret.
  Negative
Sobel doesnt want to tell us too much at any stage, but some of what he does tell us sometimes is puzzlingly opaque, as if over-calculated to keep us guessing.
  Negative
Heres one example of the filmmakers choices that doesnt give away anything about the story.
  Negative
After his blow-up with Keith, Ryder runs off and hides out at an abandoned house on the family property.
  Negative
Its a creepy, derelict place, evidently without water, power or any comforts at all.
  Negative
Come evening, Cindy encourages him to spend the night there.
  Negative
To which, the viewer may well wonder: Really?
  Negative
Though not an entirely bizarre decision, it does stretch credulity, seeming designed simply for dramatic effect.
  Negative
There are many other moments like that in the film, places where I simply didnt buy what the characters were doing or saying, even while being carried along by the storys mystery and aura of understated weirdness.
  Negative
As for the nature of the aforementioned psychodrama, its what some viewers will find off-putting while others may be puzzled as to what Sobel is actually getting at.
  Negative
Whether it's a negative, or a satisfying dramatic end-point, will depend on the individual viewer.
  Negative
In any case, the film exemplifies a very distinctive vision that marks it as one of the years most promising debuts.
  Positive
