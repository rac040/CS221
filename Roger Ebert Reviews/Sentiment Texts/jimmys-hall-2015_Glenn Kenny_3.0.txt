The stalwart English-born director  Ken Loach has stated that this picture, set in Ireland in the s for the most part, will be his final fiction feature.
  Positive
Loachs matter-of-factness as both a person and an artist is reflected in the reality that, for better or worse, theres nothing about Jimmys Hall that suggests a swan song or a grand summation.
  Negative
Its just another solid Loach film, an affectionate realist portrait of individuals fighting against state and religious oppression.
  Positive
In this case the setting, as it was for his  Cannes Film Festival Palme dOr winner The Wind That Shakes The Barley, is Ireland.
  Negative
The opening credits, however, show s newsreel footage of New York City, and is accompanied by the warm scruffy sound of American jazz on  rpm records.
  Negative
The post-credits cut to a particularly beautiful Irish landscape a narrow winding road between a grassy ridge and a similarly green but suppler hill is a bit of a shock.
  Neutral
All becomes clear soon.
  Neutral
The movies protagonist, Jimmy Gralton the Jimmy of the title, played with quiet charisma and conviction by  Barry Ward is back in his home in Irelands County Leitrim after a ten-year exile, and while away hes been working in New York, and soaking up the culture.
  Negative
That culture is some of what he imparts to the community when hes inspired to reopen a meeting hall he helped create ten years before.
  Neutral
As it happens, it was that hall, called Pearse-Connolly Hall, opened during the Irish Civil War, which played a part in Jimmys self-imposed exile.
  Negative
And now that hes back in a cozy cottage with his mum who, we learn, was a self-starting educator herself back in the day, hes a local legend to the kids, who, starved for both entertainment and enlightenment, beg him to reopen the hall.
  Negative
The main entreater happens to be Marie OKeefe Aisling Franciosi the teenage daughter of one of Jimmys oldest enemies, an army commander played by Brian F. OByrne.
  Negative
Does it break your heart or does it fill you with hope?
  Neutral
So asks one of the films characters, discussing Yeats The Song Of Wandering Aengus, at one of the halls casual reading groups.
  Negative
The conclusion is that it does both, and that can be said about a great deal of Loachs own cinematic output, particularly his  masterpiece  Kes, a movie about childhood thats right up there with Truffauts  The  Blows for honesty and empathy and sadness.
  Very positive
Written by  Paul Laverty, Jimmys Hall has a more sedate tone overall, even as Gralton and his companions face all manner of opposition from powerful forces, beginning with Father Sheridan  Jim Norton not the comedian, for heavens sake, but the Dublin-born character actor a shrewd cleric who tries to shame his parishioners out of attending any events at the hall, decrying the jazz bands that play the dances there on predictable lewd-and-licentious grounds.
  Very negative
Sheridans one of the most interesting characters in the film: a very bright man who sees Gralton as a threat to his institution on a very particular level, a person who may well be relatively tolerant in his own mind but understands that his power does not reside in tolerance.
  Positive
In a reflection of what Robert Christgau has called the tragicomedy of leftist sectarianism, certain politically minded commentators have noted that this based-on-true-events film soft-sells the fact that the real Jimmy Gralton was, besides being a community organizer, an unapologetic Stalinist.
  Negative
Oh well.
  Positive
This movie, as it happens, smooths out quite a bit of material in order to make its story points and moods conform to that of a relatively conventional Inspiring Narrative.
  Negative
Jimmy is given a lost-then-refound love whom his innate sense of nobility inhibits him from reclaiming, for example.
  Negative
The conventionality, in fact, every now and then flirts with the trite, and the movie is bereft of the rough edges and surprises that were still evident in Barley.
  Negative
On the other hand, the proceedings are conducted with both intelligence and compassion prominently placed, and the acting all around, particularly from Norton, is first-rate.
  Positive
So while it may not represent entirely accurate history, it depicts a set of values and actions the filmmaker clearly holds dear, and does so with commendable engagement.
  Positive
Enough that a viewer might wish for Loach to change his mind with respect to his semi-retirement.
  Negative
