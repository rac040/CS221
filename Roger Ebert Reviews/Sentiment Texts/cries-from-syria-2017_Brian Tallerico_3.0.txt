As I was growing up, teachers and other authority figures made me feel more comfortable about the state of the world by asserting that past atrocities like the Japanese Internment and the Holocaust couldnt happen today.
  Negative
Adulthood pokes holes in the theory that we as a people wont make the same mistakes and commit the same crimes we have throughout history.
  Negative
But its never been as starkly clarified how much the world can turn their backs to atrocities as with the current situation in Syria.
  Negative
Over half a million people have been killed this decade in the country, and millions have fled the nightmarish situation for countries throughout Europe and even all the way to the United States.
  Negative
And, for the most part, the world has done nothing.
  Negative
Evgeny Afineevskys Cries From Syria, opening in limited release today and playing on HBO on Monday night, isnt so much a documentary as it as confrontation.
  Negative
Look at this and ask yourself if you can still do nothing.
  Neutral
It should be required viewing for everyone in a position of power worldwide, especially those who would choose to enable genocide and stigmatize those who flee it.
  Positive
Inspired by the Arab Spring that toppled dictatorial regimes around the region, a group of young men spray-painted Its Your Turn, Doctor on walls around the city of Daraa, Syria in March .
  Negative
The Doctor was a reference to Bashar al-Assads background as a physician, and the seeds of a revolution felt like they were being planted.
  Negative
Sensing the dissatisfaction of his own people, Assad did what madmen in positions of power often do he responded with brutal, unimaginable force.
  Negative
The boys responsible for the graffiti were arrested, tortured and killed.
  Negative
Their deaths became a catalyst for a greater revolution, which resulted in even more horrifying action from Assad and his people.
  Negative
As protestors marched with roses and bottles of water for the soldiers, people disappeared or were tortured, often returned to their families unrecognizable.
  Negative
Over the next few years, the Syrian Army would battle with the Free Army and other protestors, turning the West half of Syria into a war-torn battlefield.
  Negative
Portions of the country deemed revolutionary to the regime would be cut off from supplies, leading to deaths by starvation.
  Negative
They would be bombed, often indiscriminately, meaning schools would be destroyed in the middle of the day, when they were full of children.
  Negative
The battle became centralized in Aleppo, the biggest economy of the region, as bombs fell on Daraya and Daraa to such a degree that kids would burn tires near schools to create enough smoke to make them difficult to fly over.
  Negative
And then Assad and his army started using chemical weapons, dropping Sarin Gas and Chlorine on his own people.
  Negative
As the region became increasingly unstable, ISIS took advantage of the power vacuum, taking over rubble-strewn villages, kidnapping the boys left there into their cause and beating the women.
  Negative
And then Russia and Putin sided with Assad, aiding in the bombing of cities like Aleppo, which has essentially been reduced to rubble and bodies today.
  Negative
Of course, men and women fled, often dying as they tried to get to safety, or being turned away from countries unwilling to accept refugees.
  Negative
And most of the world did nothing.
  Negative
The political and global scope of the Syrian situation isnt directly addressed in "Cries From Syria," which chooses an on-the-ground approach made up of footage caught by phone cameras and small digital cameras over the last six years.
  Negative
This was a revolution altered and documented by technology, and it allows us to serve witness to atrocities in ways we never have before.
  Very positive
Cries From Syria contains some of the most startling, unforgettable footage Ive ever seen in my life: A toddler drowned on the shore after an over-stuffed boat of refugees capsized' the bodies of children who starved to death from a lack of supplies' horrendous torture scenes, including a shackled man set on fire and a beheading' babies literally dying from Sarin Gas poisoning in front of the camera.
  Negative
You will have to turn away from Cries From Syria.
  Negative
It took me several sittings to get through it.
  Negative
And witnessing this kind of horror is the only way to fully comprehend whats happening.
  Negative
And why action must be taken, and support must be given.
  Negative
The impact of Cries From Syria can be almost numbing.
  Negative
I did wish for a politician to explain why the world has turned away or a military expert to offer advice as to why powerful countries have allowed Assad to use chemical weapons on his own people.
  Negative
Its horrible to say but the shocking atrocity of the last six years in Syria is apparent early in the film, and I wished for the filmmaking to expand to other subjects like what happens now and what can be done.
  Very negative
The final half hour gets to a brief bit on The White Helmets, the people who run in after the bombings to help others, and I wanted more of that story as well, a balance to the human stories of horror and proof that people can be heroic even in a living Hell.
  Positive
Cries From Syria can be so committed to its on-the-ground approach that we lose the scope of the international story here.
  Negative
We feel trapped in Aleppo, unable to see how this ends without the complete destruction of a country.
  Negative
Although perhaps thats the point.
  Neutral
Those authority figures from my youth loved to use the phrase Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it.
  Positive
Cries From Syria reminds us how much we still have left to learn.
  Neutral
