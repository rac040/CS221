Punishingly dullHong Kong action-thriller "Sky on Fire" is the worst kind of bad actionmovie: the kind that half-assedlypurports to be uplifting, but is actually only convincing when it's about explosions, car chases, and amorally spectacular violence.

  Very negative
Take another drink.
  Neutral
Just a small one this time.
  Positive
Now, you're probably thinking something that I thought while watching "Sky on Fire" though I was, and am still quite sober: what nonsense is this where a security guard for a private organization hoarding precious medical research can alsobe a good guy?
  Neutral
Haven't these people seen "RoboCop"?
  Neutral
Tingbo's moral compass is sadlynever fixed because it's never shown to be broken.
  Negative

I hope you have your drink of choice handy, because even I feel thirsty now.
  Neutral
Through it all, there's one basic tenet guiding our sympathies: human life is precious, and the people who finance life-giving research should have their clients' interests at heart.
  Positive
This is a fairlybasic concept that's articulated without much grace or ingenuity through a soul-deadeninglymessynarrative that has way too many flashbacks, expository info dumps,and other klutzydigressions.
  Negative
A myriad of side-plots distract from the factthat Lam's scenariohas no urgency.

But what about the action scenes, I hear you asking?
  Neutral
Surely they go boom real good.
  Positive
Well, yes and no.
  Negative
Many of the action scenes are covered rather than directed.
  Negative
They're only as compelling as they are brutal, like the scene where somebody gets a glass table thrown at them, or the one where a car hits a motorbike which crashes through a building and then smashes into a parked car.
  Negative
This is especially funny when you consider that Tingbo's motto is nakedly spelled out on a piece of calligraphy: "Life is so fragile."
  Positive
As you finish your drink, please notethat "fragile" is not a synonym for"precious."
