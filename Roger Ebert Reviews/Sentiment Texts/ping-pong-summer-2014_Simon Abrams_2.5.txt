It takes a while for "Ping Pong Summer," a coming of age story set in , to settle into a formulaic groove.
  Negative
This stands to reason since writerdirector  Michael Tully, director of the disorienting anti-bromantic comedy "Septien," has been rewriting and planning to make "Ping Pong Summer" since .
  Negative
The film's relentlessly quirky style of comedy is consequently very self-conscious.
  Positive
Every joke in "Ping Pong Summer" is a variation on a theme:  was the most awkward time to be alive.
  Negative
Everything in "Ping Pong Summer," from fancy-dress buffets to sexually liberated aunts and uncles, establishes the 's as an era of monumental social distress.
  Neutral
Because apparently there's nothing more distressing than a time when The Fat Boys was a thing.
  Negative
Tully's monomaniacal brand of humor is often tedious since his film's hormonally-charged world is largely established by goony, carbon-dated dialogue like "Oh, dang," and "I'm not frontin' around."
  Negative
But "Ping Pong Summer"'s ensemble cast is great at hitting the same notes over and over again.
  Positive
And, while this isn't an especially high bar to clear, Tully does nail the conventions of the teen comedies he emulates.
  Negative
So while "Ping Pong Summer" does aggressively pander to viewers' nostalgia dig that Nike track suit, and Run-D.M.C.
  Negative
cassette tape!
  Neutral
, it's also warmer and funnier than its worst jokes.
  Negative
Radford Miracle  Marcello Conte is not just any lonely  years-old doofus.
  Negative
Being a product of his environment, Rad is very social inept.
  Negative
For example, any child of the 's or 's could witlessly hard-boil an egg in a microwave, but Rad does it while beatboxing.
  Negative
During his family's annual summer vacation to Ocean City, Maryland, Rad's activities include being picked on by disaffected goth sister Michelle Helena May Seabrook, and playing ping pong with new Jheri-curled friend Teddy Fryy Myles Massey in his hysterical debut role.
  Negative
Rad also likes popular girl Stacy Summers  Emmi Shockley, and therefore stumbles into a romance-and-table-tennis rivalry with W.A.S.P. bully Lyle Ace Joseph McCaughtry.
  Positive
Also, because the 's really were a different time, Rad has a friendly reclusive neighbor named Randi Jammer  Susan Sarandon.
  Negative
So, to win the girl and have the best summer ever, Rad must do the worm, and beat the rich kid in a high-stakes game of ping pong.
  Positive
Since Rad's story is a stock plot, it's only as distinct as his friends and family are memorably goofy.
  Negative
The film's cast do much of the film's heavy-lifting since Tully tends to circle around the same jokes over and over.
  Neutral
Thankfully, all of the film's child actors are exceptional, particularly supporting characters like Massey and Andy Riddle, the latter of whom plays Dale, Lyle's fawning lackey.
  Negative
Schticky exclamations like "He's ginumongous" are only so cute.
  Positive
But these kids make you see the best in the film, and nail over-the-top lines like "My dad smoked a cigar while busting a windmill, and that sealed the deal!"
  Positive
At first glance, "Ping Pong Summer" seems conventional.
  Negative
It's easy to miss the surreal gags, and inspired deadpan line readings that distinguish Tully's film from other recent teen films that "aren't really about Gen-X getting old" spoiler alert: they totally are.
  Negative
Keep an eye peeled for the sour look Sarandon gives Massey when his character suggests that Randi nickname herself "The Rammer."
  Negative
And savor the over-achieving, suggestive wink Massey gives Conte after Stacy kisses Rad on the cheek.
  Negative
These little moments are the film's gut-busting highlights.
  Negative
The rise and fall of Rad Miracle, a teenager so gawky that his mom confuses his bathroom beatboxing for cries of masturbatory ecstasy, is necessarily basic.
  Negative
His summer vacation is a sacred oasis of warped priorities, one whose sheer weirdness only becomes clear in hindsight.
  Negative
That revelation is almost tender enough to makes preceding jokes about Funk Punch, Icees, and bad tan lines seem meaningful.
  Very negative
But only almost.
