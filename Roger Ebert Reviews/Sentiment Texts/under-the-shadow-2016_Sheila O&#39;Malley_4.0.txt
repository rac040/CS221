Taking place in  Tehran, during the "war of the cities" phase of the nearly decade long Iran-Iraq war, "Under the Shadow" is the story of Shideh  Narges Rashidi and Dorsa  Avin Manshadi, a mother and daughter holed up in their apartment, withstanding the missile bombardment.
  Negative
As the attacks increase in frequency, the city empties of people.
  Negative
Shideh and Dorsa remain, at first because Shideh is stubborn, and feeling bullied by her absent husband's demands over static-crackling phone calls from one of the war fronts where he is stationed that she go stay with his parents.

  Neutral
When Shideh is expelled from her medical school for political activity during the Revolution, her husband Iraj  Bobby Naderi is sympathetic but also says, "Maybe it's for the best."
  Positive
There is simmering resentment in the marriage, exacerbated by the instituting of laws requiring chadors worn in the street and a hemming-in of women's mobility.
  Negative
Those laws have infiltrated personal relationships, highlighting fissures in the home that may have already been there.
  Negative
The atmosphere in the apartment building among the residents is one of whispered rumors, suspicion of one another, belief in portents of doom.
  Negative

  Negative
Babak Anvari moves "Under the Shadow" from realism into horror almost imperceptibly.
  Neutral
It is impossible to know what is real and what is not, what is a result of Shideh's exhaustion and what is a valid response to living in a war zone.

  Negative
The concrete steps to the basement stretch down into darkness like a disorienting Escher woodcut.
  Negative
The tarp held down over the hole in the roof from the intrusion of an unexploded missile snaps in the wind like a sentient being.
  Negative
While "Under the Shadow" has much in common with " The Babadook," especially in its portrayal of shared sleep-deprivation in mother and child as well as an interior that morphs into a nightmarescape before our eyes, it is also reminiscent of Roman Polanski's "Repulsion," where grasping arms emerge from hallway walls suddenly, soft like clay, and gigantic cracks shiver across walls and ceiling.
  Negative
The building in "Under the Shadow" swallows up dolls and people and textbooks and VHS tapes.
  Negative
It's filled with the sounds of knocking and rattling, far-away shrieks and moans Alex Joseph's sound design is superb.
  Positive
You can take all of this at face value, or you can take it as a metaphor for the destruction outside those walls, from the war, from the Revolution before it.

It works either way.
