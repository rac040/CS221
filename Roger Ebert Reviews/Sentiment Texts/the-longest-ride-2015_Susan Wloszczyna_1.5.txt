After squirming through the all-too-accurately-titled The Longest Ride, I think I have finally cracked the code on what makes these increasingly cockamamie films based on  Nicholas Sparks novels tick.
  Negative
They might be classified as romantic dramas.
  Neutral
But dont be fooled.
  Negative
In reality, they are sci-fi adventures that unfold in an alternate universe.
  Negative
Its a place lets call it Sparks-landia where young couples will often encounter a parallel pair of oldsters whose situation somehow reflects and affects theirs.
  Neutral
Where woo will be pitched while being drenched by a water source.
  Neutral
Where simple logic does not apply, beatitudes will be pronounced at regular intervals Love requires sacrifice...always is the lesson here and coincidences involving letters and dead spouses regularly occur.
  Negative
Where eventual plot twists are often telegraphed from the moment the opening credits begin and relationship barriers that could be easily resolved are instead treated as if they were the iceberg that struck the Titanic.
  Negative
You heard of  Star Wars?
  Neutral
Films based on Sparks' books could be called Star-Crossed Wars.
  Negative
The two-hour-plus Ride, No.
  Negative
in the series, at least offers a few intriguing new variations on the usual Sparks formula of pretty bland people falling in love against a backdrop of verdantly green landscapes most often located in coastal North Carolina.
  Positive
For instance, this might be one of the few movie plots in history to prominently feature both bull riding and art appreciation.
  Negative
How are they tied together, you might ask?
  Neutral
Not with a bedazzled lasso.
  Neutral
Instead, college sorority sister and art history major Sophia  Britt Robertson, who also stars in the summer tentpole Tomorowland and cowboy Luke  Scott Eastwood  meet cute at a rodeo event he drops his hat, she picks it up and instantly take a shine to one another.
  Neutral
The former bull-riding champ is on the comeback trail, as we are told time and again, after suffering a great injurious fall while competing atop a snorting demon of a beast called Rango, a breakout performance to be sure.
  Negative
You aint seen nothing if you havent witnessed a bull buck and rear up in a circle with slo-mo snot flying out of its nose.
  Negative
Meanwhile, this Jersey-bred gal is heading to the Big Apple in two months for a gallery internship.
  Negative
He is a whole lot country shucks, he even brings a grocery-store-quality bouquet of flowers to their first date and serves her BBQ out of the bag al fresco and she is a whole lot of anything but.
  Positive
But with Luke having to be around bulls to make a living and such livestock being fairly scarce in Manhattan save for Wall Street, he and Sophia dont seem to have much of a future.
  Negative
But then fate, which is never more fickle than when it materializes in a Sparks film, intervenes.
  Negative
As the twosome head home in Lukes red Ford pickup truck product placement, including Apple and Budweiser, is rampant in Sparks-landia, they happen upon a car that slid off the road.
  Negative
Inside is an elderly man that they transport, along with a basket filled with old letters, to the hospital.
  Negative
He turns out to be Ira Levinson  Alan Alda, doing a crotchety geezer type with a twinkle in his eye as best as he can what with breathing tubes in his nose, a widower who has his own account of the heart to share that will ultimately provide the key to their futures.
  Positive
Lo and behold, diversity rears its head in Sparks-landia in the form of flashbacks featuring Iras Jewish heritage and that of his wife to be, Ruth, a cultured Austrian Word War II refugee making a new life in America.
  Negative
Sophia pays regular visits to Iras bedside, and together they read aloud his letters to Ruth.
  Positive
Why he sent these missives to someone he saw daily and why he felt compelled to describe episodes that just occurred are not explained except for the fact we are, after all, in Sparks-landia.
  Negative
Ira played in these remembrances by  Jack Huston, grandson of legendary director John, who looks nothing like Alda another Sparks tradition and Ruth  Oona Chaplin, granddaughter of silver-screen icon Charlie eventually marry, though their bliss is interrupted by his call to military duty overseas.
  Negative
A battlefield wound leaves Ira unable to give Ruth the large family of her dreams.
  Negative
In compensation, he buys her modern paintings by great painters who attend the nearby Black Mountain College to fill the walls of their home.
  Positive
While their circumstances take a rather unduly melodramatic turn once there is no wall space left, Huston and especially the rather infectious Chaplin are a more interesting match to observe than Robertson and Eastwood.
  Positive
Instead, what director  George Tillman Jr. the director of  Soul Food and Men of Honor, who obviously studied the Sparks movie handbook counts on to liven up the current-day passages are his male stars genes he is the spitting blue-eyed image of his daddy, who happens to be named Clint and drop-dead-gorgeous looks.
  Negative
While Robertson flashes a PG- breast, it is Eastwoods right nipple that gets a close-up in a bed scene.
  Negative
Still, the only thing that all this macho beefcake objectifying achieved was to give me a hankering to watch Rawhide reruns and admire the real deal, instead.
  Negative
