The horror potential of The Blackcoats Daughter peeks through in its richly textured and sensual soundtrack.
  Positive
Beyond the scores guttural beats, white noise pierces through silence and isolated sounds like a mournful wail and a knife plunging through flesh echo, producing a distinct sense of discomfort.
  Negative
Written and directed by  Oz Perkins, this is a horror film built around elliptical vagaries, as the story of three young women bound by their connection to an isolated boarding school unfolds with clandestine non-linearity.
  Negative
In spite of some compelling performances and a consistent mood, the film fails to ground any of these aesthetic flourishes in story or emotion.
  Negative
Perkins may have the sense to draw on a glacial winter environment as a mood setter but he fails to move beyond the surface.
  Negative
While set at a Catholic boarding school for girls, the full potential of that alien environment remains a convenient tool for isolation rather than a part of the films thematic structure.
  Negative
Nearly every scene is built around a slow zoom or an awkward pause, and establishing shots focus on eerily framed empty classrooms, but that approach does little to disguise the films lack of substance.
  Very negative
All three leads  Emma Roberts,  Kiernan Shipka, and  Lucy Boynton are compelling to watch though they all seem restrained by a uniform tone.
  Negative
Too much of the films mood and sense of character is defined by stilted aloofness, marked by awkward pauses and monotone line deliveries, robbing the film of variance and richness.
  Very negative
The gap between the characters purported to be disturbed and those who are merely bystanders is too narrow, a failure of writing and direction rather than performance.
  Very negative
The non-linear story fails to enrich the experience and only serves to obscure information in a cheap plea for suspense.
  Very negative
Too much information is withheld without a sense of purpose, tipping the film too deeply into ambiguity and vagueness.
  Negative
Any sense of dread that the movie inspires comes from a kind of incompleteness, like a song being cut off before its final notes, rather than a sense of discomfort drawn from difficult ideas or feelings.
  Negative
What we know about the characters is spelled out by dialogue and relies on our assumptions of high school stereotypes as we fill in the gaps of how a keener, a popular girl, and an outsider might behave.
  Negative
Rose Lucy Boynton, for example, the pretty popular girl who might be pregnant, feels like a walking after-school special.
  Negative
She might not be an obvious stereotype her aloofness guarantees it but she is never defined by anything than her beautiful face.
  Negative
The structure similarly does little to justify the inclusion of Emma Roberts character, who is defined by her mysteriousness and little else.
  Negative
For fear of spoilers, its difficult to delve too deeply into this element of the story, but her tie-in to the rest of the film lacks a satisfying pay-off.
  Negative
The movie could easily be a sister film to last years " The Eyes of My Mother," another horror that failed to wow me.
  Negative
While many of the similarities are superficial, both films are about young women gripped with bloodlust due in part to alienation, and they also build their horror through aesthetics.
  Negative
The comparison also serves to highlight that while this film was lacking for me, there is an art-house horror audience that thrives on these stories and feels compelled to fill in gaps that I personally find difficult to overlook.
  Negative
Both movies seem inspired by classics of neurotic femininity like Repulsion and   Women, but lack the characterizations and ambition to make it work.
  Negative
The films biggest risk, adopting a non-traditional narrative structure, cannot overcome the fact that the story itself has little to say about what it means to be a teenage girl and how loneliness can act as a possessing agent of the devil.
  Negative
Above all else, the films greatest failure is its inability to channel the story through emotion, spreading itself thin across themes of alienation, mourning and fears of abandonment.
  Negative
As the movie relies more heavily on aesthetics than story, greater focus would have led to a more cohesive film.
  Positive
Rather than an empty and sometimes frustratingly unfocused story, it could have been an effective tone poem.
  Very negative
Without giving any one of these anxieties enough space to evolve, it fails to channel any one of them in a particularly effective way.
  Negative
