  Positive
His writing has been co-opted many times by nationalist factions, most famously and ruinously the Nazis.
  Negative
His grave, right where his body was found on the banks of the Wannsee has become a tourist attraction after years playing host to moody young lovers looking to sit in the shade provided by one of Germanys best known romantic poets.
  Negative

  Negative
The one part of his life that hasnt been explored fully is the identity of the woman they found next to him that day.
  Positive
Before turning the gun on himself, Kleist shot and killed his friend Henriette Vogel, the wife of a bureaucrat and the mother of a young child.
  Negative
Letters written before the incident suggest that this was something she wanted after learning she was dying of cancer.
  Negative
If you dont know her name dont feel ashamed.
  Negative
Her life and legacy have been dwarfed by those of the man who killed her.
  Positive
As so often happens, shes an accessory to a great artists magnificence, one reason why he continues to captivate scholars and students  years after his death.
  Positive
But what of the woman who indulged his despair?
  Neutral
Doesnt she deserve the full breadth of consideration given to her famous friend?
  Negative
After all, she was the reason he launched himself into immortality in the first place.
  Negative
Austrian director  Jessica Hausner thought so and with her latest film, Amour fou, has gone some of the way towards correcting the historical imbalance of interest in the suicide pact.
  Positive
Shes taken liberties with the facts of the case for dramatic effect, but also because two centuries is a long time to go without someone wondering whether Vogel being shot point blank in the chest was entirely consensual.
  Negative
When we meet Henriette  Birte Schnoeink, shes uncertain how well marriage and motherhood sit with her.
  Negative
At a party, she's introduced to Heinrich Christian Friedal, whose writing she knows well, and he takes an instant shine to her.
  Positive
She seems uncertain, especially after learning how high a toll must be paid for Heinrich's attention.
  Negative
He fancies his melancholy incurable and sees but one solution to his feelings of insignificance and hopelessness.
  Negative
The catch is he doesn't want to do it alone.
  Negative
His companion, a rich socialite played by the ever-marvelous Sandra Hller, has denied Heinrich's request to die by his side, choosing to marry instead.
  Neutral
Heinrich entreats Henriette to kill herself with him, knowing that they have a connection based on a surface dissatisfaction with aristocratic living.
  Negative
It's a little less than an open question as to whether he sees in her a sympathetic, poetic soul or just someone of favorable disposition who could be talked into such an arrangement with a little pointed flattery.
  Negative
Henriette wouldn't normally entertain thoughts of suicide except that shes recently been diagnosed with a fatal illness.
  Negative
Why not die for a reason, rather than waste away in front of her husband and daughter?
  Negative
Why not, indeed?
  Negative
Vogels illness was never questioned as seriously at the time as it is in the film.
  Negative
The official word is that she was going to die either way.
  Negative
The film creates reasonable doubt because its chief interest is in telling the story of a woman at the mercy of circumstances.
  Positive
Heinrich takes advantage of Henriettes budding sense of self, which has caused her to shrink from her future as much as her disease, and importunes her to direct it towards his needs.
  Positive
One need only take a look at  Dominik Grafs  Beloved Sisters to know what Hausner's version of Henriette Vogel would have been able to do with herself if shed fallen in with a different romantic poet, one who might have told her it was possible to channel her ennui productively instead of destructively.
  Negative
Unfortunately there is very little hope that merely staying away from Heinrich was enough to guarantee a happy ending.
  Negative
When Henriettes husband notices all of the time she's been spending with the drippy poet, he throws his hands up and offers to step out of the way to allow them to be together, rather than understanding what might have drawn his wife to another man.
  Negative
There are a handful of scenes that suggest that a little more interest in his wifes mental health as opposed to her immediate gratification or physical well-being might have saved her from falling under Heinrichs hazy spell.
  Negative
Both men are guilty, even if only one has death on his mind.
  Negative
Passive masculinity, ordinarily the source of romantic counterpoint the accommodating husband, the poet mad with yearning is radically presented as a veil of insidiousness obscuring a woman's agency.
  Negative
Told honestly, the story of Henriette Vogel was never going to raise pulses as spectacle, so its a good thing that someone as masterly as Hausner is sitting behind the camera.
  Negative
Since her endearingly abrasive debut feature, Lovely Rita in , Jessica Hausner has been chronicling the lives of terminally diffident European women with unrivaled precision, showing the many ways that women can be robbed of control by higher authorities.
  Negative
With every film she's tightened up her diction, turning a frantic scrawl into resplendent calligraphy over the span of just four feature films including the understated masterpiece Lourdes.
  Negative
From the opening image of Henriette standing behind a giant arrangement of flowers - the eras reduction of femininity to the impractical and ornamental - its clear that there was no one better suited to telling a story Henriette herself never got around to putting on paper.
  Negative
Moments later we are in the Vogels parlour listening to a woman singing about the ecstasy of death, and Heinrich is reflected in the mirror on the wall just behind her.
  Positive
Hausner found a perfect visual language to tell her story: aureate frames that talk for her characters when they cant, and talk over them when they lie.
  Positive
She even finds a substitute for the dialogue Henriette attempts to have about her life.
  Negative
After watching the singer in the opening scene, Henriette proceeds to give a few small concerts of her own, singing while her daughter plays piano.
  Negative
In those moments, her smile betraying a welcome anxiousness, a sense of satisfaction and place.
  Positive
Hausner makes the case that she needed a form of expression, and was merely offered the wrong one.
  Negative
Tellingly, Heinrichs voiceover will bury the sound of her singing, his crises superseding his supposed friends joy.
  Negative
All the while Henriette is trapped by Hausners compositions.
  Negative
Doors cut rooms in half, restricting her motion.
  Neutral
Windows grant her fleeting glimpse of the world she can't enter.
  Positive
Ornate wallpaper becomes a cage to keep her a part of a houses natural order.
  Positive
There is no way for her to comfortably say whats on her mind, and when she tries, no one cares to hear it.
  Very negative
One of the final images in Amour fou rhymes with a shot near the end of Lovely Rita, only a few of the details have changed.
  Neutral
Hausner has softly evolved in the years between these movies into one of the greatest directors in the world, but her gaze at the enervating fact of female disenfranchisement hasnt wavered.
  Positive
