  Positive
The story of Martelly's unlikely and rambunctious campaign is the subject of Ben Patterson's entertaining documentary "SweetMickyfor President."
  Positive
This film captures thefeeling of that campaign, with constant seesawing between raucous concerts and political pow-wows.
  Positive
It also manages to be an honest portrait of Haiti's challenges and a wary celebration of the mess of the democratic process.
  Positive
Michel Martelly, now the President of Haiti no spoiler there, was a gigantic pop star whose onstage shenanigans were a blend of Miley Cyrus, Jim Morrison,  Michael Jackson and Madonna.
  Negative
A provocative controversial bald goofball, he wore diapers or mini skirts onstage wiggling his ass, he pulled down his pants and grabbed his crotch.

But his sexually explicit onstage persona was a smokescreen for his angry and political lyrics directed towards the National Palace inhabited by one corrupt dictator after another.
  Negative
After the regimes of Francois "Papa Doc" Duvalier, Jean-Claude "Baby Doc" Duvalier, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and Ren Prval, with coups in between, the Haiti people were fed up.
  Very negative
The Haitian diaspora looked on helplessly.
  Negative
A famous American of Haitian descent,  Pras Michel of The Fugees, wanted to do something, so he suggested that "SweetMicky" throw his hat into the ring.
  Positive
To put it mildly, Martelly started out with no political platform.
  Negative
Martelly and Pras Michel were just two guys traveling around talking in villages.
  Negative
At one point, Pras Michel, who narrates the film through on-camera interviews, admits, "I realized we didn't have a plan."

The campaign manager admits that he had to remind "SweetMicky" before every event: "This is not a concert.

  Negative
Stately circling aerial shots of the capital Port-au-Prince, the famous Citadelle Laferrire, the mass grave at Titanyen, the countryside and tent cities act as chapter markers, underscored with jaunty show-bizzy music by  Paul Brill.
  Very negative
The music gives the film an absurd and humorous tone, even with footage of street violence, rolling tanks, confrontations between the military and the people.
  Negative
Despite that tone, "SweetMicky" is not cynical or condescending.
  Negative
It's very loving towards Haiti, and presents participation as part of the contract between leader and people.

"SweetMicky" admits and revels in the absurdity of a guy who wiggled onstage in a diaper just the year before now circulating at cocktail parties in a suit and elegant spectacles.

  Negative
One Haitian-American says bluntly to the camera, "He cannot run Haiti."
  Negative
The campaign got even more outrageous when Wyclef, another member of The Fugees, entered the presidential race, causing flurries of alarm and betrayal inSweetMicky's ranks, especially since Wyclef had larger financial resources.
  Negative
So suddenly Haiti had two famous music stars gunning for the presidency.
  Neutral
But other candidates rose: Jude Clestin, son-in-law of Ren Prval, political veteran Mirlande Manigat whose campaign slogan was "Give Me My Mommy," and then, two days before the election, Aristide himself returned from exile, with crowds erupting into a frenzy of adulation, people screaming into the camera, "My Dad is back!
  Negative
My King is back!"

  Negative
American celebrities get involved.

Campaign meetings are held at B.B. King's nightclub.

It's inspiring.
  Positive
Similar to Camilla Nielsson' new documentary "Democrats" that shows two political rivals in Zimbabwe coming together to create a constitution under the shadow of long-time leader Robert Mugabe, "SweetMickyfor President" shows the fragile and sometimes-tentative steps towards democracy in an exhausted angry nation where people have had enough of the corrupt tyrannical old guard.
  Negative
Why not a guy who spent the majority of his life gyrating onstage in a diaper as President?
  Negative
Why not indeed?
