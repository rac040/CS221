Let us now speak fondly in praise of the family member we call the auntie.
  Neutral
Like the uncle, shes a specific type of influential character, but unlike uncles, aunties dont have subcategories of type.
  Negative
Theres only one kind of auntie, and shes consistent whether you call her ta or anty or simply by her name.
  Negative
She can be your ally, playing the sibling card while appealing to your parents on your behalf.
  Positive
But she can also wield the hammer of discipline with more force than your folks ever could, knocking an unforgettable amount of sense into you when you go astray.
  Positive
She accomplishes these feats with an indefatigable, take-no-prisoners attitude peppered with a bawdy, impolite sense of humor.Those of us who have aunties know that we are blessed to have them, and are better for it.
  Negative
David E. Talberts Almost Christmas has an auntie character in it, and it too is better for having her.
  Negative
She is played by the Oscar-winning actress and comedian, MoNique.
  Negative
In her stand-up comedy days, MoNique was the primary purveyor of the wisdom we associate with our aunties, which makes her Aunt May character perfect casting.
  Positive
Wearing an endless array of costumes and wigs obtained from her career as a backup singer for every imaginable soul superstar, Aunt May is unrepentantly ostentatious.
  Negative
She floats through the often predictable plotlines of Almost Christmas, sometimes serving as an instigator and other times serving as a blunt sideline commentator.
  Neutral
Every appearance is a comic joy, guaranteeing a laugh or a smile.
  Very positive
Aunt May is such a delectable force that the audience waits with bated breath to see if shell do what wed expect from an auntie.
  Positive
And she always does' her consistency is the warmest form of comfort.
  Positive
Aunt May is the sister-in-law of Walter Meyers  Danny Glover, looking frail enough for MoNique to seemingly break character to comment on it.
  Negative
Almost Christmas opens with a hat-tip to Pixars  Up.
  Negative
Scored to The Four Tops soul classic Aint No Woman Like the One I Got, we witness the evolution of Walters relationship with his wife, Grace, from the earliest days of their marriage, through several kids, including the unexpected final son conceived in their s, and finally to Graces death.
  Negative
This mini-movie is a nice bit of directorial foreshadowing' it contains examples of everything director Talbert does throughout the course of the film, right down to the eerily beautiful beams of sunlight that often accompany the Meyers youngest son whenever hes near a window in his parents house.
  Positive
That youngest son Jesse T. Usher has the potential for major league sports superstardom, but hell always be just the little, pain-in-the-ass youngest brother to his older siblings.
  Negative
Rounding out Walters brood is a politician running for office under increasingly shady circumstances  Romany Malco and the two sisters who cant stand to be in the same room with each other  Gabrielle Union and  Kimberly Elise.
  Negative
They bring various significant others and their children to the first Christmas celebration since their mothers passing.
  Positive
All Walter asks for is five days where the family can get along without the stabilizing influence of their mother.
  Neutral
But, as films like  Soul Food," Home for the Holidays and The Best Man have proven beforehand, Walters wish will not be so easily granted.
  Negative
There are enough subplots in this thing to populate a couple of  Robert Altman movies.
  Negative
This jumble of storylines never once aims outside the familiar, but its a well-acted, enjoyable jumble nonetheless.
  Negative
Theres the antagonistic relationship between Union and her high school crushnext door neighbor  Omar Epps, the wandering eye of J.B. Smooves goofy subcategory of uncle hes married to Elise, Ushers painkiller addiction, Malcos potential betrayal of his late mothers memory and the big secret Walter is hiding from his family.
  Negative
Every one of these stories climaxes in huge moments of high drama, all of which play out in front of the next generation of Meyers kids.
  Positive
These latest additions to the holiday kids table are a tech-savvy array of characters who record everything on their phones.
  Negative
They say the children are our future, and judging by these crumbsnatchers, that futures going to be instantly available for public consumption by the masses.
  Negative
When one of the kids gives a shout-out to the infamous website Worldstar Hip-Hop after recording a particularly embarrassing bit of family business, I willfully surrendered to this movie.
  Negative
The committed performances by the cast of talented actors are what elevates Almost Christmas above complaints about its familiarity and melodrama.
  Positive
Kimberly Elise is extraordinarily adept at handling heavy drama and broad comedy in the same moment.
  Negative
After all, shes a veteran of  Tyler Perrys Madea movies which, by the way, feature an auntie character that might be a tad too auntie for her own good.
  Negative
Gabrielle Union and Omar Epps bring sweetness to their story.
  Positive
And as the only two grown-ups in the movie, Glover and MoNique bring a welcome maturity even while acting like damn fools.
  Negative
Their final scene together is a beautifully rendered moment of quiet, mature introspection that the two of them play with incontrovertible grace.
  Very positive
Sometimes I question the financial viability of films like "Almost Christmas," simply because I think why would I go to a movie about a dysfunctional family holiday when I can see my own version for free?
  Negative
Perhaps what drives audiences to films like this is that sense of empathy Roger always talked about when he described what movies are.
  Negative
The people onscreen may or may not look like us, but we can find some relatability and understanding in their comic foibles and tragic events.
  Negative
Or maybe its just a need for a pleasant distraction from all the real-life hell that befalls us.
  Neutral
Whatever the reason, we need to understand and relate to one another more than ever nowadays, and if a pleasant diversion like Almost Christmas can bring this to an audience, its minor flaws are easily forgivable.
  Negative
