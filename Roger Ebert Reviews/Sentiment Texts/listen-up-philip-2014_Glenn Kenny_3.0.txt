In the interest of full disclosure, I ought to admit that Ive been acquainted with this films writerdirector,  Alex Ross Perry, for longer than I can actually remember.
  Negative
That is to say, I met Mr. Perry when he worked as a clerk at the venerable, not to say legendary, multimedia emporium Mondo Kims on St. Marks Place, in the video section, and I visited said emporium quite frequently back in the day, and almost always after Id gotten hammered at the nearby Grassroots Tavern.
  Very negative
You get the idea.
  Neutral
Ive continued my acquaintance with the filmmaker in a non-hammered state of being, but were not super tight or anything.
  Negative
Cordially-friendly I think is the right term.
  Positive
I bring all this up not just in the interest of journalistic integrity but because it is rather likely that if Listen Up Philip, the distinctively funny and disconcerting new film by Alex, is your first exposure to his work, one question you might have on exiting is What kind of person makes a movie like this?
  Neutral
For one of the things that make Listen Up Philip so distinctive is the relentless unpleasantness of its lead character, young novelist Philip  Lewis Friedman, played here with knuckle-bitten commitment by Jason Schwartzman.
  Negative
In the movies opening scene, Philip meets with an ex-girlfriend for lunch' he intends to give her the galleys of his latest novel, but when she shows up late, he browbeats her within an inch of her life.
  Negative
Having decided that abusiveness is personally liberating, he arranges a meet with an old college chum, who he abrasively condemns as a sellout.
  Negative
What about our declaration of principles, he whines, waving some paper in the guys face.
  Negative
Remember this?
  Neutral
The punchline to the scene is that Philips erstwhile friend is in a wheelchair.
  Negative
Put another human being in front of Philip, and hell figure out a way to irritate him or her.
  Negative
Is he horrible, or just befuddled?
  Negative
Things Ive coveted for years are mine now and I feel miserable, he says, sincerely' then he shoots the sentiments down: Thats so clich.
  Very negative
He purposefully alienates his long-time girlfriend  Elizabeth Moss but comes on all attentive and furrow-browed to older novelist Ike Zimmerman  Jonathan Pryce, whos cut from the same misanthropist cloth as his possible acolyte.
  Negative
And whose book jackets have the same typeface as that of  Philip Roths classic Portnoys Complaint' Roth is an acknowledged influence on Perry, although Roths conception of humanity looks as cuddly as William Saroyans when put up against Perrys perspective.
  Negative
But Philip has a few things to teach Ike about forcibly keeping the world at bay, despite the best efforts of Ikes daughter Melanie Kristen Ritter to put both men in their place.
  Neutral
Listen Up Philip is not quite so plot-oriented as Im making it sound.
  Negative
The movie has a peculiar structure, in that it follows the narratives of individual characters almost willy-nilly, delivering wry, upsetting mini-narratives of the futility of all human endeavor.
  Negative
These are all peppered with discomfiting insights and dialogue zingers, and Perrys eye for comic detail in all the right places pays off nifty dividends, as in Zimmermans very funny vanity license plate.
  Negative
The terrific cast all delves into the material full-bore, which contributes to its peculiar resonance.
  Positive
Perry may hate everyone and everything, but in making a show of it, hes thoroughly entertaining.
  Positive
One hopes he works out his anger issues some time for his own sake, but Im actually worried it would have a deleterious effect on his actual art.
  Negative
Which could still use some refining: the movies narration, handsomely read by  Eric Bogosian, doesnt really achieve the formal ends that its faux-stilted stylings are aiming for, and in fact it could have used some copy-editing.
  Very negative
Im available, Alex!
