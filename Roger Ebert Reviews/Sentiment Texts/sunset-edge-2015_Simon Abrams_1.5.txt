"SunsetEdge," a coming-of-age drama that's also Southern Gothic ghost story, is an unusual, ambitious failure, mostly because the film's hyper-naturalistic style is meant to evoke a supernatural mood.
  Negative
We watch as emotionally withdrawn teenagers communicate with each other through negligible dialogue.
  Negative
And their lazy summer hijinks--taking selfies, drinking sugary soda, and exploring an abandoned trailer park--seem to have been filmed entirely in natural light.
  Negative
Hand-held cameras follow downcast young characters as they pore over abandoned furniture, musty photographs and other left-behind debris as if the film's lead protagonists were the first people to navigate Pompeii's ruins.
  Negative
"SunsetEdge" consequently presents its characters as adolescent sleepwalkers though "adolescent" is redundant in this context.
  Negative
But despite its tantalizing central conceit, "SunsetEdge" is executed so listlessly that its creators often strain for significance that they never fully grasp.
  Negative
"SunsetEdge" thrives on mystery, though it's not atmospheric enough to be really mysterious.
  Negative
In theory, the film's nesting doll plot structure is intriguing: the first story plot A gets going, then pauses while the second story plot B catches up to where the first left off.
  Negative
Plot A is like a kinder slasher movie scenario.
  Negative
A group of teenagers haunt the ruins ofSunsetEdge, a dilapidated trailer park.
  Negative
These kids are so introverted and non-threatening that the longest conversation they have is a Socratic monologue about the group's infinitely small place in the universe apparently, they're like a grain of sand on the beach!
  Negative
.
  Neutral
They then wander around a little more.
  Negative
Time passes.
  Neutral
One member of the group, Haley Haley Ann McKnight, goes missing after photographing herself by a wood-lined clothesline.
  Negative
Then plot B kicks in, and we meet Malachi Gilberto Padilla, the last ofSunsetEdge's living inhabitants.
  Negative
Notice how little plot there is in that plot description.
  Negative
"SunsetEdge" is a mood piece, so much of your enjoyment of the film's events depends on your interest in exploring the film's decadent milieu.
  Positive
These kids solemnly tromp around unlit homes without doing any serious rummaging' they're too respectful to rummage, they're just poking around other people's homes because they're there, or something.
  Negative
So these kids reverently explore the woods surroundingSunsetEdge, never getting too rowdy, never touching alcohol, never cursing, or horsing around too much.
  Negative
Then they're joined by Malachi, a mysterious stranger who remembers how fraught his home life was beforeSunsetEdgelost its residents.
  Neutral
Plot B is where the film's subtext--about the uniquely teenaged inability to understand death and the violent, confrontational nature of life--is most comprehensible.
  Negative
"Sunset Edge" has a secret at its heart, but it's only interesting in terms of the thematic ripples it creates in the film's eerily still narrative waters.
  Neutral
Unfortunately, those ripples aren't strong enough to sufficiently shake up Plot A.Malachi's story is only relatively compelling: when he interacts with his family during flashbacks, he doesn't move around like a lost wind-up toy the way that Haley and her friends do.
  Negative
Still, if you look at Plot B as a discreet narrative, you'll find that Malachi's sub-plot is nothing but eliptically edited flashbacks, vague dialogue, fussily mannered cinematography, and a big revelation that's actually kind of predictable.
  Negative
Malachi is, in other words, not that different from Haley and her companions.
  Negative
he walks around as if on egg-shells, and watches as his family behaves without compelling or discernible logic.
  Negative
They act like ghosts, and he tries to make himself scarce.
  Neutral
Knowing that Malachi's mood is a reflection of the tense atmosphere that surroundsSunsetEdgedoesn't necessarily make the existential experience of watching "SunsetEdge" that much more compelling.
  Negative
In fact, if I were to tell you what it's like to watch "SunsetEdge," I'd tell you it's a lot of shots of tree branches swaying in the breeze, and freakishly quiet kids wandering through empty homes.
  Negative
Characters don't think in this film, they just absorb information so they can think about what they're looking at after the film is over.
  Negative
That may be true to life, but it's not exactly dramatic dynamite.
  Neutral
More often than not, "SunsetEdge" feels like a drawn-out first act for what might have been a decent movie.
  Negative
