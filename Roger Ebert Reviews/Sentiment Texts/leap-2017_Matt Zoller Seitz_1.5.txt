The emotional and visual power of dance is so great that even a mediocre film can stoke our affection merely by showing it.
  Positive
The mediocre film in question is Leap!
  Negative
, the title of which will henceforth be typed without the exclamation point, because exclamation points are not only typographically irritating but emblematic of a shallow hucksterism that undercuts the entire project.
  Negative
This story of a plucky orphan from Brittany who tries to make it as a ballet star in Paris is set almost  years ago, and lacks magic, talking animals, pop culture references that will be dated six months from now , and other tics common to so American-made cartoon features done in the Pixar-DreamWorks-BlueSky mold.
  Negative
It also bears the pedigree of a French entertainment conglomerate, Gaumont, and its technical credits are filled with Gallic names.
  Positive
So theres every reason to hope for something more than the same-old, same-old' something culturally specific and visually exciting' something with an active brain and a beating heart if not an eccentric gem like  The Triplets of Belleville or A Cat in Paris, then maybe a crowdpleaser thats as simultaneously accessible and endearing as a second-tier Pixar release like  Finding Dory or  The Good Dinosaur.
  Positive
No such luck.
  Neutral
Co-directors ric Summer and  ric Warin and their collaborators seem determined to crush the life out of an original premise and many promising characters by stealing every available page out of a substandard American studio animated features playbook, from nonstop CGI-powered, -D animation clichs montages set to contemporary power-pop ballads' gratuitous "slow motion" to highlight big moments' helicopter shots pointlessly flying around buildings and characters to lead characters that are written, designed and animated in such an obvious, overly emphatic way that "Leap" stands as a rare cartoon feature that can be legitimately criticized for bad acting.
  Very negative
Wannabe-dancer Felicie  Elle Fanning, who steals another girls identity to study at the Paris Opera Ballet' her fellow orphan Victor  Nat Wolff, an aspiring inventor' Felicies mentor and soon-to-be-mother figure, Odette Carlie Rae Jepsen' Odettes villainous employer Rgine Le Haut  Julie Khaner' Rgines hateful ballerina daughter Camille  Maddie Ziegler these and other major figures are defined entirely by their function in the films plot: the heroine, the best friend, the villain, and so on.
  Negative
But in contrast to, well, good animated films aimed at family audiences, "Leap" seems stymied as to how to move beyond those basics.
  Positive
It tries to pump them up with characterization substitutes, mainly piling on physical infirmities: crossed or lazy eyes' a speech impediment and gluttonous tendencies' gap teeth and a grating laugh.
  Negative
Theres even a one-scene cameo by a mail courier with 's-movie, swishy-gay mannerisms.
  Negative
When that gambit fails, the film will latch onto bits of allegedly comic business that aren't all that funny in the first place, and become less funny the more often "Leap" repeats them.
  Negative
Victors social and physical ineptitude, for instance, is illustrated by having him bang his head on the same church bell three times in the films opening section, then stumble, tumble and crash through every scene in which he subsequently appears, when hes not stammering and stumbling over his words and then vocally chastising himself for messing them up.
  Very negative
Odette fares slightly better, mainly because of Jepsens sensitive line readings and the long face and sad, dark eyes that the animators have given her.
  Negative
But we deduce her tragic secret the instant we meet her, and the movie, which seems averse to giving either parents or children credit for movie-going intelligence, treats her inevitable backstory-revelation as deep and powerful, when it's actually far less compelling than the relationship she develops organically with Flicie through their shared love of dance.
  Negative
Mel Brooks vocal performance as M. Luteau, the outwardly hard-nosed orphanage supervisor with a secretly soft heart, invests him with a bit of life beyond his exopthalmiaand hunched-over posture' but like so many minor characters in Leap, hes undercut by throwaway dialogue that sounds as if it was dropped into the soundtrack during post-production to explain things that don't need explaining.
  Very negative
When Luteau helps the heroine in the last act a moment anyone whos seen a movie before, any movie, will eagerly anticipate Flicie exclaims I knew you werent as bad as people say!
  Negative
Flicies story becomes compelling anyway because it couples an expression of pure willpower with that foolproof sports-and-arts movie standby, the training montage in which new skills are practiced and mastered.
  Negative
The best thing about Leap is its portrayal of the dance world, then and now, as both exhilarating and cruel: practically an altar that fanatical young people sacrifice their bodies upon.
  Positive
Anybody whos danced or been close to a dancer will testify to the emotional truth of the sequences where Odette puts Flicie through her paces, as well as to the knife-twisting comments that the Paris Opera Ballets choreographer Mrante  Terrence Scammell makes as he cuts girls from a lineup of potential Swan Lake" leads.
  Negative
But Leap doesnt seem to grasp how special these elements are.
  Negative
Rather than do its brave, tough, purehearted heroine the courtesy of concentrating on her artistic and emotional evolution and the indignities and injuries she suffers for her art, it keeps wasting her time and ours with theoretically comic or suspenseful subplots that weve seen done many times before, with considerably more wit and feeling.
  Neutral
The love triangle between the bumbling best friend-nice guy Victor and the tall, blond, full-of-himself rival Tamer Kapelians Rudolph, who claims to be a Russian prince, soon becomes tedious because neither young man seems charismatic enough to steal the spotlight away from Flicies true, great love, dance.
  Very negative
More exasperating is the sneering, shallow hatefulness of the rivals mother, Rgine.
  Very negative
She's been given Cinderellas stepmothers hell-pit eyes and fitted with a jet-black version of her tumorous hairdo, as if her constant physical humiliation of Flicie and Odette, literally her chambermaids, didnt cement that connection for us straightaway.
  Negative
The films misallocation of dramatic resources reaches a bizarre zenith in the finale, which delays the heroines understudy-who-gets-a-big-break debut another ancient clich that we spot from a thousand yards off, and cant wait to see and revel in for a long action sequence set beneath and near just-finished Eiffel Tower and the unfinished Statue of Liberty.
  Very negative
It seems mainly interested in proving that Victor was the right guy for Flicie all along.
  Negative
Given how invested weve become in her quest at that point, despite all the prefabricated storytelling hurdles placed between her and her debut, Victor's vindication is the last thing on our minds.
  Negative
Flicie deserves better.
  Positive
So does dance.
  Neutral
