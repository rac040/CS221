The small Jewish community in "The Women's Balcony" is a tight-knit one.
  Neutral
When they talk, they don't say "I," they say "We."
  Negative
They are not just a community, they are a "congregation," with all that that implies to the faithful.
  Positive
A huge box office hit in Israel, the film was written by  Shlomit Nehama, and directed by  Emil Ben-Shimon.
  Positive
"The Women's Balcony" is an eccentric portrait of an already devout community suddenly under pressure from a super Orthodox rabbi to observe their faith in a more rigid way.
  Negative
While the mood is that of a gentle and affectionate comedy, the film makes some extremely sharp points about fanaticism, sexism masked as holiness, and tolerance among the faithful.
  Very positive
In the opening sequence, the chattering ensemble noisily traipses down a narrow street of their Jerusalem neighborhood, headed to a bar mitzvah at their local synogogue, wielding plates of food and gifts, buzzing with collective excitement.
  Positive
The inciting event for all that follows occurs during the bar mitzvah when the women's balcony in the gender-segregated synagogue collapses, a collapse which puts the rabbi's wife in the hospital, and renders the building unsafe.
  Negative
The elderly rabbi is thrown into a state of confusion following the collapse, a confusion bordering on dementia.
  Negative
This is now a flock without a leader.
  Neutral
During this noisy chaotic opening, we meet the ensemble.
  Neutral
There's longtime married couple Zion Igal Naor, and Ettie  Evelin Hagoel, who have a relationship loving and playful.
  Positive
Yaffa  Yafit Asulin, Ettie's unmarried niece, is tired of having her single status be a topic of general conversation, and is lethargic about going on more dates, despite the encouragement of all of the women around her.
  Very negative
Rounding out the group are Ettie's married female friends, powerhouses all, Tikva  Orna Banai, Ora  Sharon Elimelech, and Margalit  Einat Saruf, each married to a man in the congregation.
  Negative
Into these well-worn and comfortable lives enters the handsome and charismatic Rabbi David Avraham  Aviv Alush.
  Positive
Rabbi David recognizes that this is a congregation in distress, and looks upon the collapse of the synagogue as a judgment from God.
  Negative
This congregation has to be whipped into shape.
  Neutral
Nothing less, as he says, than the fate of Israel is at stake.
  Negative
He heads up the reconstruction project, as well as addresses what he sees to be the most pressing issue facing the congregation: the women.
  Positive
Naturally.
  Neutral
Women are front and center in most discussions of theology, in any faith: What should we do with the women?
  Neutral
How do we keep them in their place?
  Neutral
How do we control their sexuality?
  Neutral
These questions were not at all factors to the "We" of the group until the cult-ish David, trailing acolytes from a nearby seminary, came along.
  Negative
All of the women in the congregation are devout, but none of them wear head-coverings.
  Negative
Rabbi David takes that on first, urging the men to make their women wear head scarves.
  Negative
The men, each of whom fall under the sway of the rabbi's passionate and inspiring personality, obey, meekly bring home scarves to their baffled and irritated wives.
  Positive
If that's not bad enough, when the women learn that Rabbi David has no intention of re-building the women's balcony in the new synagogue that women will be banned from the main room altogether all hell breaks loose.

Marriages fracture.

  Neutral
It's mayhem.
  Neutral
Those of us watching can see that the Rabbi David is a virus who has entered the healthy "body politic."
  Neutral
These people need to create some antibodies to fight him off, fast!
  Negative
But, of course, the characters in the midst of it can't perceive the threat, not at first.
  Negative
Only Ettie can see what has really happened, saying bluntly to the Rabbi who clocks her almost immediately as his  Nemesis, "Is that what a rabbi is supposed to do?
  Negative
Enter a community of good people and fill them with fear?"
  Positive
Nehama's script is filled with humorous one-liners all of these people are funny, and the humor here is character-based, not just empty schtick.
  Positive
One cowed husband begs his cranky wife to wear the head-scarf, pleading, "It'll help my income!"
  Negative
She deadpans at him, "Try working.
  Positive
Maybe that'll help your income."
  Neutral
The script is not afraid to make its points, to really go after its true target.
  Negative
It's also quite insightful about how magnetic leaders like Rabbi David can co-opt the personalitiesvalue systems of their listeners, can stir up problems in communities that are operating just fine, head-coverings or no.
  Negative
These characters are used to seeing rabbis as authority figures.
  Negative
So when the wolf in sheep's clothing enters their flock, they don't have the defense mechanisms to fight him off, or even recognize him for what he is.
  Negative
The men, especially, are useless in the face of such male authority.
  Negative
This is Emil Ben-Shimon's first feature, and a confident debut it is.
  Positive
He comes from a television background, and has said that this script reminded him of the women around him when he grew up.
  Positive
That feeling of familiarity he has with this world, these people, breathes through every pore of "The Women's Balcony."
  Positive
Ben-Shimon recognizes what is precious and also, at times, irritating in a community like this one.
  Negative
The fanatics of this earth are not live-and-let-live people.
  Negative
The rabbi David sees the collapsed balcony as a judgment, mainly because the women are not submissive silent figures in the background.
  Negative
His misogyny is palpable, but like many gifted religious leaders cloaks it as admiration: "Women are so much more superior to men, aren't they?"
  Negative
A couple of years ago I reviewed a Christian film called " Faith of Our Fathers," and bemoaned the fact that so many films aboutfaith are poorly done, listing a bunch of films at the end of the review that deal with faith in a complex way, while never belittling those who have faith.
  Negative
Most recently, Martin Scorsese's magnificent " Silence" is a mighty grappling with Catholic faith, surging with the sometimes tormented faith of its maker.
  Positive
"The Women's Balcony" takes on some extremely hot topics, and in doing so makes the point powerfully that true faith does not depend on a head-scarf.
  Negative
True faith is alive, coursing through human relationships, made manifest in how we treat one another.
  Positive
"The Women's Balcony" has its cake and eats it too.
  Positive
It is funny and profound.
  Very positive
