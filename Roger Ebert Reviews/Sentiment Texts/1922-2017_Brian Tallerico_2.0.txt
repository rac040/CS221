has truly been the year of  Stephen King, but the last in a long line of films and TV shows is, in some ways, the most surprising.
  Positive
A remake of  It was inevitable, even if no one expected it to be the box office behemoth it became.
  Negative
The Dark Tower was in some state of pre-production for years, and  Mike Flanagan personally brought his vision for Geralds Game to the bigsmall screen of Netflix.
  Negative
On TV,  The Mist felt like an obvious choice in a post-The Walking Dead world and was truly awful while the bestselling success of Mr. Mercedes made that TV adaptation inevitable.
  Negative
Which brings us to , a -page novella contained in Kings  anthology Full Dark, No Stars.
  Negative
Its a decent piece of work, but not one that screams feature film, and the relative thinness of the source material hurts  Zak Hilditchs film of the same name.
  Negative
With leathered skin from working in the fields and a remarkable Southern drawl,  Thomas Jane plays Wilfred James, a Nebraska farmer with a bitter wife named Arlette  Molly Parker and a loyal son named Henry  Dylan Schmid.
  Negative
Arlette clearly dislikes life in the country and wants to sell her half of the farm to a local livestock company, but you can literally see Wilfs skin crawl when his wife dares mention moving to the city.
  Negative
Thats for the dumb people, and the James family isnt dumb.
  Negative
Wilf commits his first despicable act when he weaponizes his sons first love.
  Negative
Henry has fallen for a neighbor girl named Shannon Cotterie Kaitlyn Bernard, and moving to the city will tear these young lovers apart.
  Positive
For reasons that arent completely captured in a believable way, Wilfred decides that the only way to make this dilemma go away is for Arlette to die, and he convinces his son to help him.
  Negative
is told primarily in flashback, as a clearly-troubled Wilfred has come to a hotel room like the protagonist of Edgar Allen Poes The Tell-tale Heart, haunted by demons he himself created.
  Negative
So theres a sense that were being told a story from an unreliable narrator, although not quite enough is made of that cinematically.
  Negative
No, for the most part,  draws a straight line down a hill from a violent act to complete insanity, a not uncommon theme for King, who has long been fascinated by what happens when men choose murder over reason.
  Negative
There is a very fine line between a film that burns slowly and one that just drags, and  falls into the latter category a few too many times.
  Positive
The fact is that its quite difficult to make a film about a man who may be going insane because you have to physically manifest what may just be the visions of a guilty mans conscience.
  Neutral
To his credit, Thomas Jane does a marvelous job of conveying whats asked of him by material and filmmaker.
  Positive
At first, his slow drawl seemed a bit overdone, but the character work here is strong, especially as Wilf goes deeper and deeper over the edge of sanity.
  Positive
The problem is how little there is of interest here outside of Janes work, which is again indicative of the issues with bringing a confessional novella to feature film form.
  Negative
The film isn't visually striking enough, the dialogue isn't memorable, and the message of the film is the relatively straightforward horror classic:don't kill people.
  Negative
Some of the imagery contained in thefinal half-hour of  nearly justifies the journey to get there, I just couldnt help thinking that theres a tighter, more thrilling version of this story that runs much shorter, like an hour-long anthology horror series.
  Negative
Ultimately, its the familiar case of a short story stretched too thin in a feature film, resulting in what will likely be the least-remembered project from : The Year of King.
  Negative
Well, except for that The Mist nonsense.
