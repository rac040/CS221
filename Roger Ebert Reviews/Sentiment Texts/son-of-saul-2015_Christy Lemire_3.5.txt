Son of Saul begins with a long, unbroken shot of mesmerizing intricacy.
  Negative
The year is  at the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp.
  Neutral
Saul Auslander  Gza Rhrig, a member of the camps Sonderkommando prisoners forced to help the Nazis exterminate Jews, thereby delaying their own deaths for a few months walks toward the camera from far off in the woods before finally coming into focus in the center of the frame.
  Negative
From there, Hungarian director and co-writer Lszl Nemes follows Saul as he goes about his daily work herding new arrivals toward the undressing room and into the gas chamber.
  Negative
Theyd been promised hot meals and well-paying jobs, something Saul has heard countless times before.
  Negative
Clearly, none of that is in store for these people.
  Negative
Nemes stays close, showing us only what Saul sees, photographing him from the back or the side, Dardennes-style, as he walks purposefully toward each destination.
  Positive
The horror remains in the periphery, a blur, but its unmistakable: the pounding and screaming from behind the metal doors, the naked and lifeless limbs being dragged across the concrete floor once the doors have reopened.
  Negative
The suggestion of the suffering is more unsettling than wallowing in it.
  Negative
Saul reacts to nothing.
  Negative
His face remains stoic, unflinching.
  Negative
Right away, we know were in the hands of a director who wants to tell the story of the Holocaust from a different perspective than weve seen before in films: a more personal, intimate one.
  Negative
Son of Saul is a movie that requires attention and patience, with a script from Nemes and  Clara Royer thats often wordless or whispered.
  Negative
If youre not a fan of ambiguity, either from a narrative or moral perspective, you may have trouble here.
  Negative
But this is just a marvel of controlled filmmaking a bold vision carried out with powerful simplicity, and an impressively assured debut form both Nemes and Rhrig as his star.
  Very positive
Rhrig has the tricky task of carrying this story on his shoulders and us along with him without the benefit of being able to emote or even say much.
  Neutral
Its a physical performance as much as it is a quietly emotional one' he has to establish who this man is mainly through his gestures, demeanor and energy.
  Positive
Saul is savvy and resourceful, traits he must use again and again to survive over the course of a harrowing couple of days.
  Positive
Then again, time is hazy here, as are many elements of Son of Saul.
  Negative
Identities are unclear at times, even of characters who play pivotal roles.
  Negative
Maybe thats intentional, though an effort by Nemes to suggest the psychological chaos that can exist in such a cruelly systematic environment.
  Negative
At the films start, Saul is a cog in this machinery: efficient, trustworthy, unshakable.
  Negative
That is, until he sees the body of a boy on the verge of death, whom doctors quickly suffocate.
  Negative
Saul is drawn to him, and makes it his mission to find a rabbi to ensure the boy has a proper Jewish burial rather than be autopsied and incinerated.
  Negative
Doctors actually refer to the body as an it a thing that needs to be taken someplace.
  Negative
Eventually, Saul claims the boy is his son.
  Negative
He may or may not be, but who he is isnt as important as what he represents: a sense of purpose, an opportunity to break free from his soul-sucking routine and achieve a sense of redemption, however fleeting it may be.
  Negative
At the same time, Saul must juggle this quest with his role in an uprising that several fellow prisoners in the camp are planning.
  Negative
He must choose between the spiritual fate of one boy and the practical greater good for a multitude of men and women.
  Positive
Its sometimes difficult to tell whos who in this obscured, enclosed setting' several men in the resistance look similar, and the one woman he has contact with in a brief but gripping scene never gets an explanation.
  Negative
But their collective urgency is palpable, and as both storylines bubble to a boil, Sauls actions become more brazen.
  Negative
Getting back to that opening tracking shot for a moment: Nemes recreates it at night toward the films end as the camps commanders carry out orders to kill an even larger number of Jews even more quickly.
  Negative
This time, we follow Saul as he navigates the frantic sea of humanity.
  Negative
Time is running out for everyone.
  Negative
Dogs bark.
  Neutral
Children cry.
  Neutral
Gunshots pierce the night sky and flames turn the whole scene into a vision of hell on Earth.
  Negative
But the camera stays with Saul faithfully, making us care for this person we barely know just as he cares for the son he barely had.
  Positive
