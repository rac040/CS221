  Negative
Its less muddled than  The Big Short and less harrowing than  Requiem for the American Dream, and though it covers much of the same territory, it does so with a playful irreverence typical of its co-writer, co-director and host,  Terry Jones.
  Very negative
After brilliantly skewering the absurdity of human nature with his Monty Python cohorts, Jones is an ideal person to tackle the delusions and greed that have led mankind into a cyclical string of disasters.
  Negative
In order to illustrate the herd mentality of capitalistic economies, Jones borrows a scene from his  classic,  Life of Brian, in which a crowd declares, We are all individuals!

With its frequent use of puppetry and quirky animation, Boom Bust Boom suggests what an old-school episode of Sesame Street wouldve played like, had it focused solely on the subprime crash.
  Negative

Perhaps the most unsettling aspect of this analysis from Jones and his writing partner, economics professor Theo Kockren, is the denial that has continuously allowed a broken system to operate unquestioned.
  Negative

The overarching problem, as noted by New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, is that the neoclassical economic model favored by universities doesnt take into account the foolishness that is so often fueled by greed.
  Very negative
The model is, at best, a helpful fairy tale that could prove to be a trap when mistaken for the truth.
  Positive
In a fascinating sequence that could be expanded into a feature-length documentary of its own, Jones explores the research of Laurie Santos, a psychology professor who has found parallels between the behavior of monkeys and humans in terms of their shared irrationality.
  Positive
When presented with two identical sums of food, a monkey will choose the sum that promises to be larger, even though that promise has repeatedly proven to be false.

The films most inspired use of puppetry enables Minskys real-life son, Alan, to have a reunion with his father, whose words are bracingly relevant even when delivered by a mouth made of felt.
  Positive
The solution proposed by Jones and his subjects is succinct: the system needs to change and people need to be better educated.
  Positive
Its encouraging to observe a group of students eagerly aspiring to become economists with a critical mind well-aware of the risks, as opposed to a blind self-assurance.
  Negative
Watching Boom Bust Boom, I couldnt help thinking of the monstrous hubris and short-sightedness that famously destroyed the RMS Titanic, and could potentially cause the rest of the world to end up underwater, thanks to corporately funded efforts to discredit the threat of global warming.
