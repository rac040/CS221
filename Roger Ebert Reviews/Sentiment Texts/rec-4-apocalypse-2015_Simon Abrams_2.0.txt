How badly do you want to see rabid computer-generated zombie-monkeys die violently?
  Negative
Because there's not much else worth recommending in "Rec : Apocalypse", the latest entry in a found-footage horror franchise about a zombie outbreak in modern-day Spain.
  Negative
"Rec : Apocalypse" starts off with a promising idea.
  Negative
Unlike the first few films, which presented Spanish zombies as Catholic demonsmonsters that shrink back when attacked with holy water and Bible passages, "Rec : Apocalypse" focuses on more secularhuman monsters: army scientists.
  Negative
The film's creators are fundamentally mistrustful of scientists like Dr. Ricarte Hector Colome, a strictly-by-the-book scientist who blithely experiments on humans and monkeys without considering his reluctant test subjects' needs.
  Negative
Sadly, that weirdly paranoid characterization of clinical scientists isn't developed beyond a point.
  Very negative
Instead, director Jaume Balaguero, the co-helmer of the first two "Rec" films, sets up an interesting villain, and then shifts gears completely.
  Negative
The rest of the film is a bland survival horror film that pits a bunch of forgettable human protagonists, including Angela  Manuela Velasco, a news reporter and the sole survivor of the first "Rec" movie, against a horde of equally disposable flesh-eaters.
  Negative
First, let's deal with the movie that "Rec : Apocalypse" is, then double-back to the movie it promises to be.
  Neutral
"Rec : Apocalypse" is, by and large, a predictable, and needlessly ugly-looking horror film.
  Negative
Angela wakes up after the events of "Rec" and discovers she's been pre-emptivley quarantined on a ship by a group of army scientists.
  Negative
She's there because scientists like Dr. Ricarte are trying to make a retrovirus to stop the zombie outbreak.
  Neutral
But inevitably, one of the scientists' other test subjects a zombie-monkey gets loose, and Angela and the ship's crew must fight for their lives.
  Negative
This sounds fairly basic because it is.
  Neutral
"Rec : Apocalypse" is easily the laziest in the film series.
  Negative
While "Rec : Genesis" was the first to ditch the franchises's lame found-footage conceit, "Apocalypse" still features pointlessly nauseating hand-held, dimly lit cinematography.
  Negative
In fact, the film quickly devolves into a collection of pointless confrontations featuring bland characters who are only interesting when their lives are in danger.
  Negative
Even Angela, a heroine that's set up to be the "Rec" series's answer to Sigourney Weaver's Ripley in the " Alien" movies, isn't especially compelling.
  Negative
She spends a lot of the movie figuring out what's going, then capably dispatches monsters with the help of capable military men like Lucas Cripulo Cabezas.
  Positive
Explosions, blood, and gore fly around them, and then you go home.
  Negative
There's nothing wrong with the film's formula-based storytelling, but rather its creators bland execution.
  Negative
Balaguero and co-writer Manu Diez never set emotional stakes that are so deep that they can't just pull them up on a scene-by-scene basis.
  Negative
Then there's the movie that "Rec : Apocalypse" should have been.
  Neutral
At the start of the film, we're shown a perfunctory, but tantalizing flashback to the end of "Rec."
  Negative
We follow a SWAT team as they fend off zombies in a dark apartment.
  Negative
These men know what's expected of them if they get infected, and are prepared to kill each other if anyone in their group is bitten.
  Negative
They cite "rules" and then unsentimentally shoot each other.
  Negative
It's a jolting start to the film, though it's filmed in a graceless, run-and-gun style that makes the film's opening feel crassly cynical when it should feel unnervingly sudden.
  Negative
Still, this introductory scene does establish an interesting parallel between the first film's no-nonsense cops and scientists like Dr. Ricarte and his colleague Dr. Guzman  Paco Manzanedo.
  Positive
Guzman plays Good Scientist to Ricarte's Bad Scientist: Guzman's patient while Ricarte's eye is always on the clock.
  Negative
When a retroviral cure seems to fail, Guzman is begs Ricarte not kill all of their test subject, but rather give him more time to test a new possible solution.
  Negative
Ricarte, by contrast, is quick to leap to conclusions, and follow protocol.
  Negative
He's frantic, and doesn't weigh his options like Guzman does, so naturally he's the film's biggest baddy.
  Negative
Too bad that neither Guzman nor Ricarte are important to the plot of "Rec : Apocalypse" beyond a couple of key scenes.
  Negative
Balaguero and Diez draw no substantial connections between the "Rec" zombies' identities as CatholicChristian demons, and Ricarte's compulsion to play God, and treat Angela like just another lab animal.
  Negative
Moreover, Ricarte's domineering need to diagnose and contain Angela looks, as it's presented, weirdly superstitious, and to no thoughtful end.
  Negative
If Ricarte's behavior is a symptom of greater social problems in Spain, you wouldn't know it based on "Rec : Apocalypse."
  Negative
So how about those fake-looking, undead simians?
  Neutral
They're gross-looking, and loud, and when they get destroyed, they make an impressive splat.
  Negative
But beyond that, who cares?
  Negative
Unless you're a diehard zombie fan, you can wait until an intrepid fanboy posts a highlight reel from "Rec : Apocalypse" on YouTube.
  Negative
Zombie monkeys are fun, but they're not worth  minutes of your time.
  Neutral
