HBOs The Wizard of Lies reunites a filmmaker and star once at the top of their games.
  Positive
In the s and most of the s, a film starring  Robert De Niro and a film directed by  Barry Levinson meant something major.
  Neutral
But the s and s havent been as kind to the two regular collaborators with a few exceptions here and there.
  Neutral
To say this solid drama is Levinsons best work in two decades isnt much of a bold claim, but its even more startling to realize how much De Niro still has in the tank when he chooses to access it.
  Positive
This is a subtle, fascinating performance a chronicle of a man who destroyed lives, including those of his family members, but never quite understood the depths of his own evil.
  Very positive
De Niro doesnt play Bernie Madoff as a villain, but doesnt exactly turn him into a sympathetic figure either.
  Negative
Mostly, he was just an asshole, a guy who made excuses for his crimes even as they were tearing his family apart.
  Negative
De Niros really subtle work is buoyed by great supporting turns from  Alessandro Nivola and  Michelle Pfeiffer as well.
  Positive
The -minute film suffers from being too long and sometimes bizarrely constructed, but its the kind of solid true story weve come to expect from an HBO Original Film.
  Positive
Almost all of The Wizard of Lies takes place in the aftermath of the arrest of Bernie Madoff in  for orchestrating the biggest Ponzi scheme in U.S. history.
  Negative
When his sons Mark and Andrew, played here by Nivola and  Nathan Darrow, who worked for Madoff, discovered that dad was writing an exorbitant number of bonus checks in December, he confessed that he was just trying to take care of people before the Feds came for him.
  Negative
And then they learned the truth everything they thought they knew about their father and the business was a sham.
  Positive
They actually went to the Feds early and turned Bernie in, realizing that they would already be called accomplices, and knowing that every minute they waited would make that charge harder to deny.
  Negative
So, from its opening scenes, The Wizard of Lies is set up as the story of a family falling apart.
  Negative
While the script by  Sam Levinson and  John Burnham Schwartz and  Samuel Baum occasionally flashes back to happier times, it stays focused intently on how Bernies betrayal impacted Mark, Andrew and Ruth Madoff Michelle Pfeiffer.
  Negative
Right away, the boys tried to distance themselves from their father, and, when Ruth stayed with Bernie, they had to avoid her calls as well.
  Negative
Theres a scene in which Bernie learns that his sons have refused to sign off on the bond to get him out of jail thats one of De Niros best acting moments in years.
  Positive
You can see the pain on his face thats somehow also blended with guilt.
  Neutral
On an emotional level, he cant believe his sons arent standing by him, but he also knows exactly why theyre not.
  Negative
The structure of The Wizard of Lies can be a little frustrating as the film jumps back and forth in time, structured around a jailhouse interview with Madoff done years after the house of cards collapsed, and spending an incredible amount of time on the details about how exactly the scheme unraveled.
  Negative
Theres a better version of this film thats half an hour shorter, and I wanted more of scenes like two key flashbacks: one to a lavish party that shows how much everyone around Bernie benefitted from his evil, and one in which Bernie basically had to play con man to keep money coming in when the market crashed.
  Negative
Mostly, The Wizard of Lies is a film of fantastic acting beats the way Pfeiffer captures a mother choosing husband over sons' the way Nivolas paranoia builds as he realizes the public hates him too' the matter-of-fact decisions of a suicide attempt by the Madoffs when they saw no other way out.
  Positive
Whats most fascinating is how well De Niro portrays a man constantly making excuses.
  Very positive
He claims that his investors and the government didnt want to look too hard because they were making money, although the movie is quick to call him on that bullshit logic.
  Negative
Its also unafraid to portray Madoff as a greedy asshole, the kind of guy who kept his kids in the dark and ruined their potential careers, guilting them into staying in an illegal operation instead of moving on to legitimate ones.
  Negative
A writer once compared Madoff to Ted Bundy, and the truth is neither saw the value of human life.
  Negative
Madoff never concerned himself with the impact his behavior had on the people around him, and the truly sad thing is that the people he damaged most of all were the ones who trusted him completely, his family.
  Negative
