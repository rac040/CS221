You wouldnt know it to look at me now, but there was once a time when I had quite a bit of expertise in the Marvel Universe.
  Negative
I came as close to tearing up while reading a comic book as Ill ever do when the Scarlet Witch finally married The Vision as eloquent an argument for marriage equality as genre fiction has ever essayed, by the way.
  Negative
I did, I must admit, check out well before the entity called The Guardians of the Galaxy turned up in said universe.
  Negative
I bring this up because there are some MU characters in the movie "Guardians of the Galaxy" that I did recognize super-evil demigod Thanos, Drax The Destroyer, and one or two others I guess but I ultimately found that it was that particular continuity, the need to tie this movies adventures into something larger, that made the movie lag a bit.
  Negative
In many respects, Guardians, directed and co-written by indie wit  James Gunn, and starring buffed-up former schlub  Chris Pratt and Really Big Sci-Fi Blockbuster vet  Zoe Saldana here dyed green as opposed to her " Avatar" blue, is a fun and relatively fresh space Western.
  Positive
Think Firefly pitched at -year-olds, with a lot of overt " Star Wars" nods.
  Neutral
And super-irreverent dialogue that is, more often than not, genuinely funny.
  Positive
The wisecracking by the characters played by Pratt a kind of junior Han Solo and voiced by Bradley Cooper whose Rocket Raccoon, who is, yes, a genetically altered raccoon is so incessant viewers of a certain age might wonder whether this movie has been put through the "Whats Up Tiger Lily" dialogue-replacement treatment before release.
  Negative
Pratts self-styled Starlord and Rocket are not the strangest of initially inadvertent teammates in this intergalactic posse.
  Negative
Saldanas Gamora is a stealthy warrior princess whos been lying low in an evil family before revealing her good intentions' wrestling star  Dave Bautistas Drax is a vengeance-driven behemoth whose florid language only briefly masks his inability to take anything other than literally' and Rockys muscle, Groot, is a walking, minimally talking tree.
  Negative
These guys are entertainingly motley, which makes the fact that their mission, to save the universe from a mass-murdering megalomaniac who seeks an item which will grant him unimaginable mass-murdering power yes, more mass-murdering power than he ever had before, is generic in a way thats pretty consistent with movies of this sort.
  Positive
You may have noticed, incidentally, that a lot of film critics tend to get kind of defensive when reviewing movies based on comic books.
  Negative
Like, you probably noticed that up top I tried to claim some comic book-respecting bonafides.
  Negative
Ive done this thing before when reviewing comic-book movies.
  Negative
Some day, I may have to actually bring out the big guns, like the fact that I used to be palsy with Mike Kaluta, or that I once went to a Halloween party at Berni Wrightsons house.
  Negative
I dont do this because Im afraid of getting death threats from easily irritated comic book fans which hasnt happened to me, and thanks.
  Negative
I do it because as someone who got a lot out of comics growing up, and still has a healthy respect for the graphic form, I find comic book movies kind of frustrating, and am bent out of shape by having my frustration chalked up to a lack of understanding of the form.
  Negative
What does this have to do with Guardians?
  Neutral
It ties into what I mentioned before.
  Neutral
While this movie is pretty lively in a lot of its particulars, the stilted portent with which its villains the bumpy-jawed Thanos  Josh Brolin, not that you can tell and the megalomaniacal Ronan  Lee Pace make themselves felt is pretty tired.
  Negative
The funny animal tributehomages of Guardians bump up uncomfortably against the faux-majesty of the bad guys in a way that the actual comic-book form is malleable enough to at least sidestep.
  Negative
I think Gunn knows it, too: one of the movies only genuinely subversive jokes sees one of the heroes actually yawning in the pro-forma slow-motion walk to destiny shot that heralds the movies climax.
  Negative
Which climax is, as is also pro forma, big and loud and filled with indiscriminate destruction and slaughter of sentient beings.
  Negative
But as it takes place on a planet other than the one the audience is on and so doesnt involve the razing of a recognizable city, its a little less troubling than it might have been.
  Negative
It seems as if Im listing a lot of not-fun things in what Ive called a fun movie, but again, Im just voicing some frustration because, in my puny mind which can only imagine the extent to which Gunn and his team had to fight for every bit of creative license they were allowed the not-fun parts seemed entirely avoidable.
  Negative
What will win the day among those not given to overthinking will be the charm of the cast which also includes  Benicio Del Toro in a bit role that allows him to exercise a generous amount of his legendary performing eccentricity, and  Michael Rooker in a gruff part that would have gone to Ron Perlman had Guillermo  Del Toro directed the movie the sunniness of its eventual optimism, and the infectiousness of its vintage-Earth-pop soundtrack.
  Negative
A soundtrack the films characters appreciate as much as the audience will, which is part of the whole point.
  Positive
