Pasty pin-up boy Edward Cullen and his undead clan cant compete with the fabulously aloof and effortlessly cool creatures of the night lurking in  Jim Jarmuschs "Only Lovers Left Alive".
  Positive
They dont need the sun to sparkle.
  Negative
They are superstars illuminated from within.
  Positive
Not that Jarmuschs denizens of the dark are so mundane as to be directly referred to as vampires during the course of this pleasurably droll and languorous soak in a pool of comical musings, nostalgic longing and sorrowful loss.
  Negative
They are more like supreme beings, too good for the mundane and crassly disposable st-century chaos that exists outside their carefully curated domains.
  Negative
The domestic fortresses where they doze during daylight hours are bursting with rare books, objets dart, collectible musical instruments, exotic fabrics, ancient electric gadgets and other relics culled from the many centuries they have existed amongst us lesser mortals.
  Neutral
Like most of Jarmuschs films, the emphasis is not on action but interaction especially the verbal kind.
  Negative
And atmosphere.
  Neutral
Loads of atmosphere, down to the sounds of far-off howls and crimson-red Gothic lettering during the opening credits.
  Negative
As usual, his pacing is decidedly unhurried the less kind might say sluggish but it is made more than tolerable by the presence of a pair of exceedingly appealing lead actors.
  Positive
Michael Fassbender almost took on the role of Adam, a later-day Count Dracula who resides not in a Transylvanian castle but in a spooky dilapidated mansion on the rundown outskirts of Detroit.
  Neutral
But lucky for us,  Tom Hiddleston whose passionate following is as devoted as Fassbenders, thanks to his witty and wily Loki from the Thor franchise has taken his place.
  Positive
With wavy dark hair cascading Veronica Lake-style over one eye and boasting a poets slim-hipped physique, Hiddleston is a much better fit as a woeful and weary loner who finds solace in collecting classic guitars and penning mournfully hypnotic mood music.
  Negative
The only thing that truly relieves his gloom is his spouse and soulmate,  Tilda Swintons more upbeat Eve.
  Negative
This runway-ready vision in a fawn-hued apparel, sunglasses and leather gloves while topped by a tangled mop of beige hair resides across the globe in Tangier, but stays in touch with her Apple iPhone.
  Negative
Adam, Eve, Apple get it?
  Neutral
Despite the distance between them, Jarmusch cleverly signals their psychic connection to one another from the first scene when a spinning -rpm record fills the screen and rockabilly queen Wanda Jacksons witchy wail resounds on the soundtrack.
  Positive
That hypnotic image dissolves into the sight of two reclining figures going round in a circle, seemingly in the same room yet miles apart.
  Positive
The story, such as it is, revolves around a concerned Eve paying her beloved Adam a visit, which requires booking a night-time-only flight and selecting just the right fake passport.Why they are apart is not fully explained,  though we are left to guess it has to do with Eves close ties to Christopher Marlowe.
  Negative
Yes, that Christopher Marlowe, the Elizabethan tragedian whom some believe including Jarmusch wrote the plays  attributed to Shakespeare.
  Negative
He, too, is a vampire but less than thriving.
  Negative
The conceit that he is still around, hiding out in Morocco and supplying fresh untainted blood to Eve comes a bit out of nowhere, but  John Hurt invests both pathos and humor into the role.
  Negative
It is just one of the ways that Jarmusch, who with his legendary shock of white hair could be a cool vampire himself, allows his characters to toy with supernatural lore instead of over-explaining their lifestyles.
  Positive
Fearing contamination from feeding on humans directly, Adam, posing as "Dr. Faust," gets his supply of hemoglobin by bribing a hospital worker who goes by the name of Dr. Watson  Jeffrey Wright.
  Negative
He also employs the services of Ian  Anton Yelchin, a none-too-swift kid who may or may not have tipped off others about the existence of Adam and his underground recordings.
  Negative
Ian, who is a real bloodhound when it comes to fulfilling his masters craving for rare guitars, doesnt seem to question Adams nocturnal habits or the fact that his bathroom is perpetually out of order.
  Negative
The only time he gets suspicious is when his delivery of a Gretsch Chet Atkins gets Adam reminiscing about seeing rocker Eddie Cochran of Summertime Blues fame who died in  perform while using that model.
  Negative
Ian pipes up: "You saw Eddie Cochran play?"
  Neutral
"On YouTube," quickly explains Adam, covering his tracks.
  Negative
Its akin to Bela Lugosi saying, "I never drink wine."
  Negative
The arrival of Ava, Eves brazenly bratty little sister who is given a mischievous spin around the seductive bloodsucker block by  Mia Wasikowska, soon up-ends the order of their carefully maintained universe.
  Very negative
But the best parts are when we get to witness the reunion of Adam and Eve, sipping blood in aperitif glasses or slurping it in Popsicle form, driving around the ruins of a downtrodden Detroit in a vintage sports car when Adam mentions the Motown Museum, Eve begs off: "Im more of a Stax girl myself" and sharing ancient memories of acquaintances past.
  Negative
I imagine this might be how  David Bowie and paramour and, later wife Angie intertwined during the height of their passion.
  Negative
A couple of kooks hung up on romancing.  "
  Negative
Mary Shelley what was she like," inquires Eve about Adams friend who wrote Frankenstein.
  Negative
A look of fondness flashes in his eyes as he responds, "She was delicious."
  Positive
