The squawks that Florence Foster Jenkins emits when straining for high notes sound as if she were a goose trying to lay an oversized egg after ingesting helium.
  Negative
Her pitch could not be any flatter if it were a bulldozed pancake found under a ton of bricks.
  Negative
During her lone public performance, she huffs and puffs and nearly blows down Carnegie Hall while committing auditory assault in the first degree.
  Negative
But at some point while watching Florence Foster Jenkins, I can guarantee you will find yourself growing quite fond of this early  th- century New York City dowager, despite her eardrum-puncturing delusions of being a Valkyrie-level opera singer.
  Negative
Thats because, in this charming and delightful biopic that bears her name, the matronly Jenkins is an endearing and courageous stand-in for countless other mortals whose aspirations in the arts often far exceed their talents.
  Positive
Whereas most of us these days would simply settle for karaoke, Jenkins was in possession of a magic ingredient that helped make her performing wishes come true money.
  Negative
Gobs of it, inherited from her father.
  Negative
As a generous and gracious promoter of music in many forms, Jenkins invested wisely.
  Positive
She was a chummy benefactor to the famous likes of conductor Arturo Toscanini and formed a club for her coterie of fans that included lunches overflowing with sandwiches and potato salad, ladled from an actual bathtub.
  Negative
She also had her own private nightspot where she staged living tableaus, including one that involved her precariously hanging from the ceiling attired as an angel while a team of men engaged in a titanic struggle to keep her plump form aloft by means of a pulley.
  Negative
Jenkins is also blessed to have  Meryl Streep, pulling off yet another miraculous physical transformation that is as delicious in its own way as was her joyful depiction of famed chef Julia Child in  Julie and Julia.
  Positive
Oscars favorite diva relies on many of her usual tricks to not only nail the oft-times sweetly farcical elements embedded in the role, but also capture the poignancy of a -year-old woman who cherished music so much that she put her own health at risk in order to share her lifelong passion with others.
  Negative
With a broadened waistline, bonus facial wrinkles, an obvious wig to disguise a bald head and a wardrobe consisting of everyday frocks that resemble flowery tents or ornate senorita stage costumes, the actress puts all vanity aside and makes us believe she is this person.
  Very negative
Streeps biggest triumph, however, is how she fully emulates her characters unique vocal stridency.
  Positive
Her own early opera training comes in handy here and when a recording of Jenkins is heard before the end credits, it becomes astonishingly clear just how skilled Streep is at singing badly.
  Negative
She also is not alone in breathing life into what could have simply been a fusty little old lady period piece.
  Negative
British director  Stephen Frears, who has previously proven to be adept at showcasing wonder women of a certain age  Helen Mirren in The Queen,  Judi Dench in  Mrs. Henderson Presents and  Philomena, coaxed  Hugh Grant out of semi-retirement to play Jenkins devoted common-law husband St. Clair Bayfield.
  Negative
Its a good thing he did, too, since Grant gives one of his finest performances ever.
  Very positive
At first, it is easy to be suspicious of Bayfield, a middling Shakespearean actor, whose primary purpose is to dote on Jenkins, indulge her every whim and shield her from hearing any harsh reaction to her rancid arias.
  Negative
Grant has done his fair share of cads over the years.
  Positive
Is he just a gigolo plundering her riches for his own gains, especially since he keeps a separate apartment complete with a much younger mistress?
  Negative
But it becomes apparent soon enough that there is a deep and sincere connection between the pair as he tenderly calls her bunny rabbit and she flutters in her devoted protectors presence like a giddy schoolgirl.
  Positive
And where has this comedic prodigy  Simon Helberg been hiding all this time?
  Negative
On TVs The Big Bang Theory for  seasons, thats where.
  Neutral
What  Alden Ehrenreich was to Hail, Caesar!
  Negative
earlier this year a standout amongst stars that is what Helberg is as Cosme McMoon, Jenkins shy, pigeon-chested accompanist who is often on the verge of full-out hysteria when not stifling giggles over his employers warbling deficiencies.
  Negative
He, too, acquires a respectful affection for Jenkins, as revealed in a quiet scene where they perform an intimate Chopin piano duet that is touching enough to draw tears.
  Negative
The story itself is intriguing but veers too far towards the overtly sentimental as it concludes.
  Negative
But in a rather off-key summer movie season heavy on rehashed material, Florence Foster Jenkins will strike a chord with those looking for relief in the form of originality, top-tier acting and amazingly godawful singing.
  Positive
An extra bonus?
  Positive
The sense of kindness afforded to its central grand dame, a commodity that has been short supply of late as an ugly, insult-filled political contest marches on.
  Negative
