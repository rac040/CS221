In Black Butterfly,  Antonio Banderas reclusive, alcoholic writer character Paul suffers from extreme writers block.
  Negative
How does the film communicate this?
  Neutral
It opens with a shot of him leaning over a typewriter writing the words, I am stuck over and over again on a single page.
  Negative
This would be a snort-worthy sight gag in just about any other movie, but in Black Butterfly, its one in a long line of leaden attempts to wink at the camera.
  Negative
Director  Brian Goodman recently recurred on the TNT drama Rizzoli and Isles" and co-screenwriters  Marc Frydman producer of Flyboys and  Welcome to Mooseport and  Justin Stanley co-writer of Beneath Loch Ness" have crafted a charmless, nonsensical thriller, filled to the brim with faux-insights that wouldnt impress even the most inattentive college freshmen.
  Negative
Black Butterfly communicates all of its empty-headed ideas idiotically, but still retains a knowing smugness regarding its intentions, like its pulling a rabbit out of a hat while acting like no ones ever seen such a trick.
  Negative
The films needlessly drawn-out plot involves Paul inviting transparently creepy drifter Jack Jonathan Rhys Meyers, overacting like his life depends on it to stay at his house for reasons not worth explaining.
  Very negative
While ostensibly fixing up the place, Jack learns that Paul is trying to write a screenplay to pay off some the bills, so Jack gives him an idea for a film the story of how they met!
  Negative
Of course, Jack gets a little too familiar with Paul and his writing, turns out to be an impulsive weapon-wielding psychopath, and eventually takes Jack and his realtor crush Laura  Piper Perabo, utterly wasted by the film hostage.
  Negative
Oh yeah, and theres been a bunch of murders in the town recently, which may or may not be relevant information spoiler alert: it both is and is not relevant information.
  Negative
Putting aside every plausibility concern imaginable, which include everything from Antonio Banderas passing as a writer to the premise itself who witnesses an assault in a diner and then invites the perpetrator to stay in their home?
  Negative
, Black Butterfly still collapses under the weight of its own brand of stupidity, specifically the desire to convey both writing and life advice beneath the guise of a home-invasion thriller.
  Negative
Jack operates as something of a wide-eyed wellness coach to Paul, pushing him to recommit to his work and to give up drinking, even though he ironically speaks in tips youd most likely hear from a drunk at the end of a bar, mainly the importance of being real.
  Positive
If you squint so hard that your retinas might be in danger of permanent damage, you can find the genesis of a moderately compelling idea a jailer uses violence to motivate a trapped soul to free himself but Frydman and Stanley never generate enough tension, dramatic or otherwise, to help it blossom.
  Negative
With bland, creaky action and sub-standard performances Banderas comes off best, but scans as constantly bored, all that remains is the God-awful, self-aware maxims about narrative derived from the meta-commentary without any foundation is inherently clever school of hard knocks.
  Negative
Most characters seem like what they are: characters in a movie, Jack tells Paul early in the film, an infuriating line that implies simply acknowledging hollowness somehow renders it substantive, a sentiment that runs through the entire film.
  Negative
And then there are the twists.
  Positive
Dear Lord, the twists.
  Positive
Yes, there are two, the second more insulting than the first.
  Negative
They successfully throw Black Butterfly off-balance in a way that forces the audience to question why they even watched the film in the first place.
  Positive
Moreover, the twists also attempt to provide cover for any and all substantive criticisms, similar to a bully pushing you in the mud and then claiming, We were just rehearsing for a play!
  Negative
Obviously, the aforementioned cover is insufficient and offensive to anyone who even mildly cares about coherency.
  Negative
Honestly, the only interesting part of Black Butterfly is that legendary director  Abel Ferrara cameos in a single scene as a shopkeeper, begging the question, Why arent you in a better film?
  Negative
