There is no doubt that  Tina Fey has enriched our lives.
  Negative
She wrote  Lindsay Lohans last watchable and best star vehicle, s  Mean Girls.
  Positive
Her Liz Lemon on the sitcom  Rock gave us the perfect upgrade on swear-word substitutes with Blerg!
  Positive
Her scathingly brilliant Sarah Palin impression on  Saturday Night Live helped save the country from four years of the real thing in office.
  Very positive
She and her co-host  Amy Poehler injected comic relevance into the Golden Globes and turned a moldy awards show into must-see TV.
  Neutral
Even just her few faux-tipsy moments alongside Best Production Design co-presenter  Steve Carell during last Sunday's Oscar telecast provided a burst of screwball freshness when Fey described the set of  The Revenant as the thing where a bear lives and mangled the phrase the nona-mees are Therefore, it is painful to observe that this talented woman has yet to show us she has what it takes to be a truly compelling presence on the big screen.
  Positive
The problem is, Tina Fey is always Tina Fey.
  Negative
Even when parodying the former governor of Alaska, she cant let go of that wicked glint in her eyes.
  Positive
Her film debut as a math teacher in Mean Girls is still her most satisfying cinematic performance.
  Very positive
Never has this handicap been more apparent than in what is being offered as Feys chance to dig deep a la fellow SNL alum turned leading lady  Kristen Wiig and surprise us with her dramatic chops in "Whiskey TangoFoxtrot."
  Negative
The Afghanistan-set dramedy is based on an insightful, entertaining  memoir injected with  MASH-style irreverence by Chicago Tribune war-zone journalist  Kim Barker.
  Positive
But much has been tweaked in translation.
  Negative
The title went from The Taliban Shuffle to military slang for WTF.
  Negative
Barker has been reborn as Kim Baker.
  Negative
And her occupation has been re-invented into a TV news correspondent, presumably to provide better on-the-job visuals than watching someone type.
  Negative
It has been reported that the actress, who is also one of the producers, was drawn to the material after a New York Times book review noted that Barker portrayed herself as a sort of Tina Fey character.
  Negative
If that just isn't free license to simply play yourself, or at least your familiar persona, I dont know what is.
  Negative
Nonetheless, it is initially mildly entertaining to see this -ish fish-out-of-water character push herself beyond her unsatisfying comfort zone both at work and in her private life  Josh Charles, who pops up occasionally as the boyfriend she left behind, might as well have future cheater tattooed on his forehead.
  Negative
Culture shock strikes immediately after she lands in Kabul, where she is told the air is filled with feces.
  Negative
There are easy laughs to be had at the outset when her head scarf slips off and a native woman sneers with the aid of subtitles, Cover yourself, you shameless whore.
  Negative
Luckily, Kims translator-driver-and-all-round-guardian-angel, Fahim American actor  Christopher Abbott, who recently impressed in  James White, assumes a questionable Afghan guise, is there to guide her through local customs and dangerous situations.
  Negative
But once she arrives in the rowdy Animal House-style residence set up for foreign members of the press, it is clear that the film could have easily been called Frisky Tango Foxtrot.
  Negative
Tanya  Margot Robbie of  The Wolf of Wall Street, a slinky blonde British on-air journo, welcomes Kim and immediately assesses her attractiveness to men declaring her Kabul cute while assuring, Here, youre a .
  Negative
While there are several scenes where Kim puts herself in harms way to get her story cars explode, bombs go off, gunfire rings out, a gathering of men get angry when she tries to hide a camera under her traditional full-body cloak while filming them the narrative often feels more like a raunchy sex comedy than a birds-eye view of the on-the-job hazards that the actual Barker routinely faced.
  Negative
Instead, when Kim firsts meets  Billy Bob Thorntons crusty general while covering his Marine unit, he warns her not to sleep with his men.
  Neutral
Tanyas first question after meeting Kim is if she would mind if she slept with the men assigned to protect her.
  Neutral
The lusty Afghan prime minister  Alfred Molina, a British actor of Italian and Spanish descent who has turned into a modern-day  Anthony Quinn would grant the rookie special access if she becomes his special friend.
  Negative
True sexual tension arrives in the form of  Martin Freemans rudely rogue-ish Scottish shutterbug and its only a matter of time before bickering turns into bedding.
  Neutral
Actually, the casting goes a long way to camouflage the flaws that flare up, and screenwriter  Robert Carlock who worked with Fey both on  Rock and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and directors  Glenn Ficarra and  John Requa who wrote  Bad Santa and helmed  Crazy, Stupid, Love know their way around bawdy behavior and all-night carousing.
  Negative
What they cant do is create believably harrowing action sequences with New Mexico ably filling in for the Middle East.
  Positive
Meanwhile, Fey and Robbies makeup never smudges and rarely do they break a sweat.
  Negative
Is Whiskey Tango Foxtrot a horrible movie about a white outsider plopped in the middle of Afghanistan?
  Very negative
No, that would be last years  Rock the Kasbah.
  Neutral
But neither does"Whiskey Tango Foxtrot" fulfill its assigned duty to provide evidence of Feys versatility.
  Negative
After seeing Carell and her together on the Academy Awards, perhaps they could remake  Born Yesterday for these Trump-ish times.
  Negative
Fey playing dumb?
  Negative
Now that would be a challenge.
  Neutral
