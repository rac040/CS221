"Heal the Living" starts with a wordless and lengthy opening sequence so dreamlike, so beautiful and meditative, that everything that follows and much follows is informed by it.

  Very positive
The fact that the morning ends in a tragic car accident, leaving one of the boys in a coma, just intensifies the memory of that opening sequence its vision of grace, strange beauty and the wonder of the momentary.
  Positive
Adapted from Maylis de Kerangal's  novel, "Heal the Living" is director Katell Quillvr's third feature, and shows her humane vision of the interconnectedness of humans and the fragile miracle of life.

The plot comes straight out of any hospital-based episodic, but it's Quillvr's approach that is so unique, and ultimately, so powerful.

  Positive
A former musician named Claire  Anne Dorval and her two college-age sons  Finnegan Oldfield and Theo Cholbi sit in an apartment together, across from a hospital.
  Negative
The texture of their relationship is sensitively drawn, shown in eloquent fragments, the three of them curled up in bed together watching "E.T.," the boys nervously solicitous of her, old beyond their years, but childlike in how they cuddle with their mother.
  Negative
Claire has a degenerative heart disease, and the three of them are waiting for news of a possible heart transplant.

Quillvr allows the story to tell itself, gently, slowly, no pushing, no obvious prioritizing.
  Negative
Because in such a life-or-death situation, the only priority is the moment.
  Negative
There can be no other.
  Negative
Through the merging rivers of these two narratives is Quillvr's devotion to how each small world glimpsed operates: how the organ donation team works, the midnight flights carrying ice-packed organs, the white board filled with possible recipients and donors, the almost balletic ritual of surgery preparation, the last-minute phone calls, the good-byes.

Tom Harari's cinematography is fluid and flexible: there are moments of sweeping startling movement, like in the opening as the camera follows Simon riding through the streets on his bike, careening around corners, the freedom and exhilaration of youth, and then there are moments of stillness, the camera capturing flickers of thought and emotion on a person's face.
  Very positive
This is deeply human filmmaking.
  Positive
