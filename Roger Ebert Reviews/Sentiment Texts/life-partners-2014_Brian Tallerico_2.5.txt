Why does it feel nearly revelatory to see a film that treats female friendship with respect?
  Neutral
Not as a device to get one of the women hitched to the right guy and not as an undeveloped subplot to serve as comic relief until said protagonist walks down the aisle.
  Negative
This is at the heart of why  Bridesmaids was such a smash success  Kristen Wiig conveyed something truthful about female characters who felt like friends and not plot devices or the broad caricatures of so many Hollywood comedies.
  Negative
And yet weve seen few films like it since.
  Positive
And so the moments of believability in the surprisingly entertaining Life Partners have greater resonance.
  Positive
Yes, the plot machinations puncture a bit of that believability balloon, but the honesty in this films core love triangle is something that other filmmakers, especially those interested in telling stories about women, would be wise to copy.
  Positive
Much of that truthfulness can be traced back to casting.
  Positive
Gillian Jacobs was always entertaining on NBCs Community, but the hit show was often stolen from her by more vibrant personalities like  Donald Glover and Danny Pudi.
  Positive
Here, she proves, without question, that she can carry a film.
  Positive
Shes grounded and likable as Paige, best friend to Sasha  Leighton Meester.
  Positive
These two have a nearly co-dependent degree of friendship, talking every day on the phone, getting together to mock Americas Next Top Model, and helping each other through failed relationships.
  Negative
The core of Life Partners the friendship between Jacobs and Meester is surprisingly genuine, and it goes a long way to the success of the overall film.
  Very positive
Too many movies about friendship force actors or actresses who seem like theyd never even talk over the Kraft Services table much less actually hang out to portray friends, and so the core of the film rings hollow.
  Negative
The core here is solid.
  Positive
And so we feel it when the friendship between Sasha and Paige is tested by the natural progression of life.
  Positive
Sasha has had nothing but bad luck in love, bouncing from relationship to relationship, and commiserating over her failures with her other lesbian friends like Jen  Gabourey Sidibe and Jenn  Beth Dover.
  Negative
Paige has seen her share of losers as well, and Tim  Adam Brody, who happens to be married to Meester in real life looks like just another bad beau at first.
  Negative
He quotes  The Big Lebowski far too often to be a viable romantic candidate.
  Negative
And yet he becomes one.
  Neutral
He seems genuinely, sweetly interested in Paige, and the subtle way this relationship unfolds is one of the strengths of Life Partners.
  Very positive
It doesnt happen overnight, as in so many Hollywood rom-coms.
  Negative
When these two fall in love, they do so gradually and believably.
  Neutral
Before she knows it, Sasha has to make room on the couch for Tim during their weekly Top Model snark-fests.
  Negative
And then Paige is missing them altogether.
  Negative
Paige pushes herself into uninteresting dates with scene stealers like  Kate McKinnon and  Abby Elliott, as so often happens when our friends find partners' we seek out our own with more fervor.
  Negative
More than anything, Life Partners captures how romance alters friendship.
  Positive
We have to adjust to our friends significant others, and realize that we may not be the most important person in their life any more, even if they are still the most important person in ours.
  Negative
The first act feels a bit forced in some of its character set-ups, but once Life Partners settles into a loose, character-based groove, it really works at least until it's forced out of that again with some awkward plot turns in the final half-hour.
  Negative
Its a sad commentary on how rarely we see female friendship that feels truthful in cinema that this comes as such a pleasant surprise.
  Positive
