Certain discontents of contemporary Russia get a fascinating, provocative treatment in  Kirill Serebrennikovs The Student, the tale of a high school boy who disrupts his school and home as he falls deeper and deeper into religious mania.
  Negative
In certain moments, the film displays a daring thats bound to strike some viewers as extraordinarily nervy.
  Negative
In scenes early and late in the story which obviously reflects a displeasure with the increasing prominence of state-sanctioned religion in Russia characters make bold statements while standing beneath a portrait of Vladimir Putin, a gesture of stinging commentary that makes you wonder if the filmmaker is not pushing the envelope of whats permitted in Russian cinema.
  Negative
The main characters slide begins innocuously enough.

  Negative
Interestingly, his arguments arent dismissed out of hand by everyone.
  Negative
While young teacher Elena  Viktoriya Isakova, evidently the facultys most liberal member, rolls her eyes at Venyas crusade, the principal Svetlana Bragarnik muses that maybe teen girls wearing bikinis is too provocative.
  Negative
Perhaps they should wear less revealing bathing suits.
  Negative
As this might suggest, one of the strongest aspects of The Student is that, while its view of Venyas beliefs is decidedly skeptical, it doesnt ridicule him or suggest that others are immune to his Biblical zealotry.
  Negative
As he becomes more vocal, he gains one disciple.
  Negative
A crippled boy named Grigory  Aleksandr Gorchilin, whos taunted and abused by the other kids, accepts Venyas friendship and allows him to try some spiritual healing on him.
  Negative
He also develops a crush that will become very problematic.
  Negative
Though everything Venya proclaims is offered with Bible quotes to back it up, his faith is clearly of his own making, and of a stronger potency than more conventional varieties.
  Negative

  Negative
And its her biology class that enrages him most.
  Positive
When she teaches that homosexuality is a natural expression of sexuality, and tries to demonstrate the use of condoms with carrots, he strips naked and storms through the classroom ranting against her until the principal runs in to stop the commotion.
  Negative
When the subject is evolution, Venya stages his classroom rampage dressed in a gorilla suit shades of  Toni Erdmann and scores a victory of sorts when the principal, intervening yet again, wonders if the school perhaps should teach the Biblical account of creation alongside Darwins ideas.
  Negative
Elena remains commendably sanguine through many such insults to reason until she explodes under that portrait of Putin that all this servile Father worship will inevitably lead to a totalitarian dictatorship but her defenses of homosexuality, feminism and evolution are not finally what light Venyas fuse.
  Negative
Its when he discovers that shes Jewish that he decides she must be stopped, and the deep ugliness of his crusade becomes undeniable as well as physically dangerous.
  Negative
Though it has elements of satire and moments of comedy, The Student which, at two hours, could stand to be a bit shorter is a serious, sharply mounted drama that gets more engrossing as it moves along.
  Positive
Serebrennikovs writing is smart and flavorful, and he gets terrific performances from his cast the older actors are all Russian screen stars.
  Very positive
The director also has a very distinctive style, using extended takes and fluid handheld camerawork that makes the most of  Vladislav Opelyants attractively naturalistic photography.
  Very positive
In all, the film may be the strongest piece of Russian cinema to reach the U.S. since  Leviathan two years ago.
  Positive
