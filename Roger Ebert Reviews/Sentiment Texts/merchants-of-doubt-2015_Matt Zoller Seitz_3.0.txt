What do the deniers of climate change and apologists for big tobacco  have in common?
  Neutral
Spokespeople sent into the media to sow doubt.
  Negative
Director  Robert Kenner "Food, Inc." and his cowriter Kim Roberts lay it all out for us in "Merchants of Doubt," a compendium of public deceptions based on the  same-titled book by science historians Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway.
  Negative
The story begins in the s with the tobacco industry's strategy for staving off government regulation, then moves on through the decades.
  Negative
The film shows how public relations strategies devised to make the public doubt that cigarettes caused cancer were refined into a template that would be used by industries selling all sorts of materials and products, including food and food additives, pharmaceuticals, oil, coal, asbestos, and flame retardant chemicals used on furniture coverings.
  Negative
The latter is the focus of the movie's strongest section, which shows how the tobacco industry's obscuring tactics were applied to another industry's PR problems.
  Positive
In the s, when scientists first linked cigarettes to cancer, the public relations firm of Hill amp' Knowlton created what turned out to be a winning strategy: augmenting the direct lies of tobacco industry executives and spokespeople with "third party" testimonies by people who seemed to have no dog in the hunt but were really wearing an invisible corporate leash.
  Negative
Scientists and pseudo-scientists hired by big tobacco were ushered into the public eye to sow doubt about the science, and plead for more studies, or more time to study the data before concluding that cigarettes were harmful.
  Negative
There's a montage of tobacco industry shills repeating variations on "Cigarettes may not be hazardous."
  Negative
The movie compares this to three-card Monte dealers paying a "stranger" to stand near them, watch them with delight, then participate and "win" the game, so that bystanders would think it wasn't rigged, join in, and lose their money.
  Negative
The cigarette doubt-sowers succeeded with this approach a generation.
  Positive
Warning labels didn't appear on cigarette packages until , and advertising was regulated slowly over the next few decades.
  Negative
The movie shows how the same strategy was applied by companies that made the chemicals used to treat furniture.
  Negative
Until the s, a large number of people died from fires caused by smokers falling asleep without extinguishing their cigarettes.
  Negative
Because it would have cost money to treat cigarettes with flame-extinguishing chemicals, the tobacco industry planted a "legislative representative" from their own ranks within the National Association of Fire Marshals, which then argued that the real problem was furniture catching fire.
  Negative
This led to furniture being treated with "flame retardant" chemicals sometimes as much as two pounds' worth in an average sofa that did not actually retard flame, and that were subsequently linked to ailments and conditions, including low fertility and cancer.
  Negative
Chemical manufacturers sowed doubt about health problems caused by their products through a front group, Citizens for Fire Safety, which was shuttered in  after a Chicago Tribune investigation discovered that they were funded by Albermarle Corporation,  ICL Industrial Products and Chemtura, the three largest makers of flame  retardant chemicals.
  Negative
The movie is filled with similar examples of corporate treachery, leading up to the present day, which finds oil and gas companies sowing doubt about climate change through front groups, hired gun scientists and other shills.
  Negative
Oreskes, co-author of the film's source book, appears on camera to tell how she fact-checked the widely repeated assertion that there was no consensus on climate change, and discovered that of  scientists who'd seriously studied the topic, not one thought there was serious doubt that human industry and pollution contributed to a rise in average global temperatures.
  Negative
This is a huge, unwieldy topic.
  Negative
The filmmakers do an admirable job of condensing their information and making it comprehensible.
  Positive
They don't really succeed in unifying it, though, or in making the whole enterprise seem like more than a collection of talking points for people who are mad about climate change deniers, people paid to sow doubt about the damage caused by smoking, and their ilk.
  Negative
But that doesn't seem to be the point of the movie.
  Negative
The film is mainly useful as one-stop shopping for the opposition.
  Negative
Scored with mischievous caper music, it keeps  revisiting an ominous and purely metaphorical archive filled with  damning documents picture the warehouses at the ends of " Citizen Kane"  or " Raiders of the Lost Ark".
  Positive
It uses computer graphics and digital  compositing to show incriminating papers gliding out of folders and  floating through the air as if manipulated by accusing spirits, and  superimposes the filing cabinets with news footage of industry bigwigs  and hired "experts" going on talk shows and appearing before government  committees to deliver an approved script.
  Negative
"Merchants of Doubt" opens with scenes of illusionist Jaimy Ian Swiss  performing card tricks for an audience at The Magic Castle in Los Angeles.
  Negative
He tells the viewer that while he's a proud expert at fooling audiences, he makes an "honest living" because the people  who watch him expect to be tricked and know it's all entertainment and  that the same is not true of shills for  corporations aiming to deceive the public, thwart government regulators, and protect shareholders.
  Positive
"It offends me  when someone takes the skills of my honest living, if you will, and  uses it to twist and distort and manipulate people and their sense of  reality," he says.The movie returns again and again to images of illusionists, card sharps and street hustlers, to show how industries' self-protective strategies are variations on con games.
  Negative
The only real challenge, explains magician Swiss, is "how to mask the shill."
