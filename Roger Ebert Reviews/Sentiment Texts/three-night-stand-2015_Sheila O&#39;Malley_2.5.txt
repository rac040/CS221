Pat Keilys rom-com Three Night Stand is an ensemble picture, with the unmistakeable feeling of a French farce, or a comedy of manners with eccentric secondary characters moving in and out of the action' doors slamming up and down hallways' intrigues and sexual romps going on in claustrophobic quarters.
  Negative
The French farce aspect of the film is its true heartbeat.
  Positive
These characters are not really serious people, and it is difficult to take any of them seriously.
  Negative
Thats fine, it gives Three Night Stand its special lunatic edge.
  Positive
But when it asks us to invest in Carl and Sue, the two lead characters, the story falters.
  Negative
Carl and Sues relationship is so general, and so unformed, that the film doesn't appear to have a clear grasp of what it is really about.
  Positive
Carl and Sue  Sam Huntington and  Meaghan Rath are a married couple on their way to a winter weekend at an isolated Bamp'B in Quebec.
  Negative
He is a frustrated game designer, and she is so beautiful that people stop dead in their tracks to comment on her looks.
  Positive
It happens a couple of times, showing that Kiely has conceived of Sue in an extremely limited way, not caring to give her a personality or some traits that would explain who this woman actually is.
  Negative
Rath does the best she can to humanize Sue based on the little information she is given.
  Positive
Although Carl and Sue both seem extremely young, they have been married for some time, and are on autopilot, bickering and having bored or unsuccessful sex.
  Negative
Turns out Carl is haunted by a woman from his past named Robyn.
  Negative
Carl has never told Sue about Robyn, but then it turns out, amazingly, that Robyn  Emmanuelle Chriqui owns the Bamp'B where Carl and Sue will be staying!
  Negative
What a coincidence!
  Neutral
Awkwardness ensues, especially when Sue figures out that Robyn and Carl have a past, and, worse, that the couple used to come to this very same Bamp'B for sexy-times getaways.
  Negative
Meanwhile, the other characters enter the scene.
  Neutral
Also staying at the inn is a somewhat famous young French actor named Anatolii  Aliocha Schneider, traveling with his cougar-ish elegant mother Anne-Marie Cadieux.
  Negative
Sue recognizes Anatolii immediately from his films and gushes over how much she loves him, igniting Carls jealousy.
  Negative
Anatollii drones on about how he is on his way back to France to star in a  Catherine Breillat film: Sue gasps in admiration, Anatoliis mother nods serenely, Carl rolls his eyes.
  Negative
Rounding out the cast of screwballs is another married couple, friends of Carls, Stacey  Reagan Pasternak and Doug  Jonathan Cherry, who crash the weekend unexpectedly, barging in with oversharing monologues about their yeast infections, their sex lives, dispensing terrible advice to everyone.
  Very negative
Over the course of the weekend, these seven individuals go skiing, have sex, make maple syrup, argue, careen around on Ski-Doos through the forest, do yoga angrily.
  Negative
As the relationships start to fracture, en masse, the film hits its stride.
  Negative
Keily has a good ear for dialogue, and a nice sense of the absurd.
  Positive
Sue, in telling Carl how on she has to be in their relationship, says, I feel like Im in a Broadway play.
  Negative
And its been running for three years.
  Neutral
Its a funny script, although the plot requires a series of coincidences so unbelievable that Keily actually spends time trying to justify them thereby calling attention to them even more.
  Positive
The real problem is that Carl and Sue seem like bit parts in the fascinating dramas of other people.
  Positive
Why did they hook up in the first place?
  Negative
What bonds them together?
  Neutral
What will be lost if they dont make it?
  Neutral
They bicker like siblings, and its hard to feel that there was a relationship there as a foundation at all.
  Negative
Both Huntington and Rath are capable actors, and they do nice work, but Anatolii and his mother, Stacey and Doug, even Robyn who shows a dark strain of dissociation underneath her smiling capable surface, have more life, stronger objectives, and higher stakes than either lead character.
  Positive
Three Night Stand is refreshingly unsentimental in a lot of respects, and gimlet-eyed about romantic relationships, rare in the genre, but the film lacks a strong center.
  Neutral
