Pure evil meets unshakable faith in Katrin Gebbe's torturous "Nothing Bad Can Happen," a film that begins as a meditation on human behavior and belief but crosses the line into pure sadism.
  Negative
Its a think piece designed to start conversations but is more likely to leave audiences wanting to perform an act of charity or just take a shower than hit a coffee shop to discuss the film.
  Negative
Gebbes debut writerdirector status leads to a lack of refinement in the films themes but "Nothing But Can Happen" sure does shatter the often-happy cinematic landscape of the summer season.
  Positive
Its the Feel-Bad movie of the year.
  Neutral
"Nothing Bad Can Happen" plays like a hybrid of " The Stepfather" and Lars Von Triers " Dogville."
  Negative
Clearly inspired by LVT, Gebbe even divides her film, based on a true story, into three chapters.
  Negative
In the first, "Faith," we meet the innocent Tore  Julius Feldmeier, a homeless teen who has been drawn in by the Jesus Freaks, a group of devoutly religious young people.
  Negative
One day, Tore stumbles upon a family in need after their car has broken down.
  Negative
He prays for the car to restart, and, wouldnt you know it, a higher power appears to answer.
  Positive
He invites the patriarch of the clan, a burly man named Benno  Sascha Alexander Gersak to attend a Jesus Freaks gathering that night andTore's secular new friend surprisingly shows.
  Negative
At the party, Tore has a seizure, and none of his "supportive friends" seem to even notice.
  Negative
Benno does.
  Neutral
He helps him, soon taking him into his family.
  Positive
Bennos questioning of Tores faith and general demeanor along with the clearly ironic title and Tores "simple" approach to life make "Nothing Bad Can Happen" something of a slow-burn horror film.
  Negative
We know things are going to go very wrong for this young man, and the tension comes in how it unfolds.
  Negative
Benno first seems to take to Tore like the son he never had, especially after daughter Sanny Swantje Kohlof cant handle the competitive patriarchs approach to bumper cars.
  Negative
Hints of darkness in the family long before Tores arrival pop up, such as when Benno hugs Sanny a little too close and gropes her.
  Negative
Mother Astrids  Annika Kuhl disappointed looks go in the other direction.
  Negative
As Benno continues to challenge Tores beliefs, his cruelty becomes more intense.
  Positive
Before you know it, hes drowning a cat and asking Tore if his God will save the animal.
  Negative
And thats really just the beginning of the torture about to befall a young man who believes that Jesus will always be there for him.
  Negative
"People always pray when theyre scared shitless."
  Positive
Lines like this hint atthe biggestproblem with "Nothing Bad Can Happen" shallow observations disguised as insight.
  Negative
Yes, of course they do.
  Neutral
Now whats your point?
  Neutral
The overall issue with "Nothing Bad Can Happen" is a lack of purpose.
  Negative
Tore is unshakable in his belief and comes to convince himself that Benno is his "test" and it is hismission to help save Sanny.
  Negative
Nave, faithful, trusting people taken in by maniacally evil ones is a tale as old as the Bible and Gebbes approach feels like the work of a young writer who doesnt quite yet have the life experience to bring the depth required for a story of faith vs. evil to bring something new to the conversation.
  Negative
And yet theres too much promise here to write it off despite its thematic misses.
  Negative
Theres a reason that Gebbe has won critical awards in Germany.
  Positive
The film has a lyrical visual palette, almost like a bad memory, and Gebbe draws very strong performances from her cast.
  Positive
Everyone is good but ithinges onthe dynamic between Feldmeier and Gersak one a lanky, blond teen with a wide smile' one a short, dark-haired villain.
  Positive
When Benno begins to push against Tores faith, Gebbe doesnt look away.
  Negative
When her writing attains the depth and ambition of her already strong directorial skills, viewers wont be able to look away either.
  Positive
