Somethings missing and we all feel it,  Jeff Bridges narrates over some twee line-drawing animation illustrating that New York aint what it used to be back in the day when they were making  Taxi Driver here.
  Negative
Okay, he doesnt mention Taxi Driver that would tend to muddy his characters point but he does mention  Lou Reed quoting Yeats from the stage of The Bottom Line and laments the death of that legendary rock club.
  Negative
Its probably a SoulCycle now, he says, making a play on the idea of lack-of-soul.
  Negative
As it happens, it is not a SoulCycle' the building, which long belonged to New York University, is now being used for classes.
  Negative
The narration is by way of introducing this movies characters, in particular its main character, Thomas Webb, a young man who was born too late to have caught any of Lous Bottom Line shows, poor lad.
  Negative
Lanky and bespectacled, once the movie switches to live-action, he stands before a framed Saul Steinberg New Yorker cover with Mimi, whos not quite his girlfriend they slept together, once, on a date he obsessively remembers, August , but she reminds him they were both hopped up on molly at the time, and discourses on the times he wishes he hadnt missed.
  Negative
Mimi chats on, and she mentions to him that she may be headed to Croatia on a fellowship.
  Negative
This crushes him, he says, because, and I quote, Youre the only thing in my life Im settled on.
  Negative
Theres a rub here.
  Neutral
This is obviously going to be a coming-of-age story, so the character is going to have some growing up to do.
  Positive
So, were not going to initially be all that into him right off the bat.
  Negative
Nevertheless, theres something a little sickening about the glib confidence that  Callum Turner, as Thomas, brings to the line reading.
  Negative
That Mimi is played by a lovely woman of color,  Kiersey Clemons, adds a certain something to the dynamic.
  Positive
What Im saying is, in a comedic bildungsroman like this one, its apt to have doubts about the hero early on, but youre not supposed to want to throw him out of a high window.
  Neutral
I did, and I never quite recovered from that feeling.
  Negative
Thomas, not quite crushed returns to his Lower East Side walk up and finds on his steps one Jeff Bridges, playing a garrulous codger who introduces himself as W.F. Gerald and encourages Thomas to unload.
  Negative
Thomas does, and Bridges then provides the narration to wax clich philosophical about Thomas family and their dinner-party friends: successful-wealthy publisher dad Ethan, played by  Pierce Brosnan, and depressive-loving Mom Judith, played by  Cynthia Nixon.
  Negative
Pals who wax nostalgic about old NYC and the golden days before the Internet ruined everything include  Wallace Shawn,  Debi Mazar, and  Tate Donovan.
  Negative
Now Bushwick is expensive, one character exclaims.
  Negative
Very timely.
  Positive
Between this and the cynical observations Bridges adds, the scene really blows the lid off social activity.
  Negative
Intrigue arrives with the revelation that Ethan has a mistress, a beautiful editor named Johanna, played by  Kate Beckinsale.
  Positive
Thomas confides all this to W.F., who subsequently will not stop repeating the phrase Visions of Johanna.
  Negative
Thomas fury turns to something else, and soon he too is sleeping with Johanna.
  Negative
Directed with splashy competence by  Mark Webb, this is the kind of movie whose idea of a fake-out is to play Simon and Garfunkels version of Blues Run the Game before breaking out the actual title song.
  Negative
Its the kind of movie in which, after sex, the sheets miraculously arrange themselves to cover up body parts the filmmakers are contractually enjoined from showing.
  Negative
The kind of movie that wants to be a short story by Cheever or Updike or Roth but cant help but being what it inescapably is, an impotent cry of Yes I Can Do Literary from a screenwriter whose idea of literary has been permanently Hollywoodized.
  Negative
The script, by Allen Loeb who also gave the world last years  Collateral Beauty, a kind of cinematic Extraordinary Event positively splashes about in a sitz bath of male self-flattery.
  Negative
While one certainly doesnt expect much in the way of verisimilitude with films such as these, some larger sense of self-awareness would be nice.
  Negative
For instance, near the end of the movie Thomas is compelled to confess to Mimi what hes denied to her all along, that is, that he has indeed slept with, and been sleeping with, Johanna.
  Negative
My expectation was that Mimi, whos a reasonably smart person, would reply reasonably with Yeah, I know.
  Negative
Instead, the film has her break down and practically cry, No, I thought you were good.
  Negative
This takes things well beyond wish-fulfillment and into the realm of metaphorical public self-pleasuring.
  Positive
The twist that W.F. turns out to be a Famous Author the fictional composite Loeb dreamed up alludes to both  Thomas Pynchon W.F. is reclusive AND Nick Tosches W.F. has been to an actual opium den is then supplanted by another twist thats jaw dropping in many ways.
  Negative
None of them the intended ones.
  Negative
But it does the neat trick of letting every single character off the moral hook, because somebody thinks it has to.
  Positive
In that pernicious sense, its actually kind of clever.
  Positive
But not exactly admirable.
  Negative
The movie is also noteworthy in that its the first one Ive seen in which I did not enjoy Jeff Bridges.
  Positive
His performance isnt bad as such.
  Negative
Its just that the character he plays is so unnecessary.
  Negative
Obviously he doesnt think so.
  Neutral
The great actor who, you may or may not know, was actually the favorite of producers Michael and  Julia Phillips for the lead role in, youll never guess, Taxi Driver is also an executive producer on this picture.
  Positive
