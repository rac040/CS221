" Aftermath," a new revengedrama starring  Arnold Schwarzenegger, is considerably more contemplative and downbeat than the Austrian leading man's fans might expect.
  Negative
Unfortunately, the film's commendably atypical focus on characters, mood, and psychological realism does not make Schwarzenegger's latest necessarily good.
  Negative
We spend much of the film waiting forsomething to happen aftertwo strangers a construction foremanSchwarzenegger and an air traffic controller  Scoot McNairy have their lives implicitly bound togetherby the collision of two commercial airliners.
  Negative
"Aftermath" should be refreshing for its atypically slow build-up to these two characters' climactic meeting.
  Positive
But more often than not, it feels lifeless and angsty, mostly because it never has anything substantial to say about the grieving process beyond immersing viewers in trite representations ofpost-traumatic stress.
  Negative
The film's short-comings are especially upsetting since Schwarzenegger is actually rather good in the film, and proves once again that, despite a severely limited range, he knows how to brood.
  Positive
Schwarzenegger plays Roman, a man who works with his hands, but is woefully unable to do anything after a plane crash perpetuated by a combination ofequipment failureand negligence by well-meaningfamily man Jake McNairy kills his wife, his daughter, and his daughter's unborn child.
  Negative
Roman is devastated.
  Neutral
He stays in his house, sees nobody, visits his family's grave, and generally stares off into the mid-distance.
  Positive
Roman has emotionally checked out, and that gives Schwarzenegger a lot of room to be moody and exhausted, his two main emotional registers during recent performances.
  Negative
He doesn't know Jake, but he's shown to suffer just as much as him.
  Negative
Jake, post-accident, cannot concentrate.
  Negative
He tries to show love to his wife and son, but that proves futile.
  Negative
He doesn't sleep well, is obsessed with the news, and is hounded by the press.
  Negative
We spend much of "Aftermath" waiting for these two characters to catch up with each other, which should give you an indication of the emotional pressure that builds throughout this film.
  Positive
Yes, "Aftermath" is inevitablyabout revenge, but it's alsoabout the emotional stakes that lead characters to want to avenge their loved ones.
  Positive
Still, this movie does not make narrative sense beyond a point since it's essentially a series of scenes that show how consumed by grief these two characters are.
  Negative
That's not alwaysa bad thing.Schwarzenegger carries many of his scenes, like the one where Roman, facing a panel of unfeeling bureaucrats,demands that somebody apologize for the death of his family.
  Negative
The scene in general may be hackneyed who really needs to see another angry man face an uncaring world ruled by ass-covering company men but it does have a kernel of raw emotion thanks to Schwarzenegger.
  Positive
The scenes that revolve around Jake and his wife Christina  Maggie Grace are similarly rote, but intense.
  Positive
You really get the sense that these characters are going through hell when she tries to break through his self-pity and convince him that a temporary separation might eventually lead to the salvaging of their marriage.
  Negative
Grace comes off as a real person in that sense, even if the scenes themselves do inevitably gravitate around McNairy's hang-dog expression, and his pitiful inability to do anything but pout and parrot his wife's suggestion that they spend some time apart for their son's sake.
  Negative
Still, there are way too many scenes where Jake and Roman unproductively sulk and revel in shell-shock.
  Negative
The film's cast do the hard work of making you believe these characters exist, but director  Elliott Lester "Blitz," "Nightingale"and screenwriter Javier Gullon rarely give them anything worth saying.
  Negative
Gullon skillfully avoids some majorclichs, and genuinely gives you the impression that he's interested in his characters' inner lives.
  Very positive
But what does it say about "Aftermath" that Roman's inner turmoil is expressed through generic recurring nightmares about his wife and daughter'sairplane breaking apart before his eyes?And why does the movie dwell so much on Jake's marriage, to the point where it inadvertently confirms his latent fear that he is nothing without his family?
  Negative
"Aftermath" is consistently too neat to be thoughtful.
  Positive
Still, I don't want to dismiss this film too hastily since it does give viewers a rare opportunity to watch Schwarzenegger, one of the last great action stars, prove he's more than just his muscles.
  Negative
Schwarzenegger is, in a couple of scenes, filmed with his clothes off, as if to remove the mystique of his bulky frame.
  Negative
He'll never be average, but he looks less imposing with his chin stuckto his enormous chest, and his eyes on his feet.
  Negative
The man still radiates menace when he needs to, but he never had to work so hard to do it.
  Negative
Gone are the days of one-liners and gory deaths.
  Neutral
Today's Schwarzenegger is a man of inaction.
  Neutral
This new lookkind of suits Schwarzenegger, an actor whose limited range has often made him the target of unfair criticism.
  Negative
Now, the man doesn't have to just provide a presence though that's realistically more than moststars, regardless of genre, are able to do.
  Negative
Here, his essence is boiled down toa deferredlook, a hardstare, or a slumpedpose.
  Negative
Or, put another way: his body talks without overstating the obvious.
  Neutral
I just wish it had something more to say.
  Negative
