"Wish Upon" is another one of those movies that would be memorable if it were a lot better or a lot worse.
  Negative
Joey King "Oz the  Great and Powerful" stars as Claire Shannon, a teenage girl whose mother  killed herself years earlier.
  Positive
Claire grew up into an unhappy teenager who feels like a pariah and gets bullied.
  Negative
She's also humiliated that her father, Jonathan   Ryan Phillippe, dumpster-dives all over town, even across the street  from her school.
  Negative
Then her dad finds a mysterious box inscribed with  Chinese characters.
  Neutral
It's a wishing box that gives its owner seven  wishes.
  Negative
The downside is, every time a wish comes true, somebody dies.
  Negative
And we're off!
  Neutral
That  sounds like a decent setup for a schlock horror flick, but it's hard to  tell what director  John R. Leonetti "Mortal Kombat: Annihilation" and  writer  Barbara Marshall saw in this story.
  Negative
The screenplay made The  Black List, an annual film industry survey of the "most liked"  unproduced screenplays.
  Positive
But it's tough to discern from the evidence  onscreen that anybody could see something remarkable in this material,  besides the possibility of making money from people who thought they'd  be getting a great or even good horror film, as opposed to one of those  here-and-gone time-wasters that I used to watch at the dollar theater when  I was a kid.
  Negative
The best thing you can say about it is that the acting is  alright, there are a few decently executed moments of nastiness, the whole thing is in focus and you can understand what's being said.
  Positive
There's  not much internal logic to the way the script sets up Claire.
  Negative
She's made  out to be a pariah, but she has two spirited, funny, attractive friends   Sydney Park and  Shannon Purser, aka Barb on "Stranger Things", and  when she's bullied, she stands up for herself immediately.
  Positive
The  characters speak in outdated 's and 's slang "Bitchin'!"
  Neutral
"No way."
  Neutral
"Yes, way", and they are often played by actors who seem too old, or at  least too self-possessed, to be teenagers.
  Negative
The conception of all the  young characters feels like an older screenwriter's idea of what it  means to be young and American at this point in history.
  Negative
This all  matters because originality and specificity would've set the story apart  and made it seem special.
  Positive
The story is steeped in  Orientalist cliches that are also very 's.
  Negative
The box exudes The Ominous  Mystery of the Far East, and Claire has a crush on a Chinese American  classmate named Ryan Hui Ki Long Hee of " The Maze Runner", who takes  the box to his cousin Gina  Alice Lee, who translates the characters in  exchange for an order of won tons.
  Positive
The script thinks that if it  makes the Asian characters  cool, and includes a couple of lines shading Claire for stereotyping  Chinese people, it won't seem like it's wallowing in the same cultural cliches that  drive older horror and fantasy films.
  Negative
This is also the kind of movie where one of the  heroine's friends chastises her late in the story for wasting her seven wishes  on popularity and personal riches when she could be using the box to  solve world hunger' this comment plays like a preemptive strike against  criticism, and only serves to remind us that the movie can't or won't explore its central idea in anything but a perfunctory way.
  Negative
Nor is "Wish Upon" willing to crank up the outrageousness and  really go for it a scenario that might've at least secured a spot in the Midnight Movie Hall of Fame.
  Negative
"Wish Upon" livens up  whenever the box extracts its blood price, but only a little.
  Negative
Nobody ever dies in an unremarkable way, only through  chain reaction slapstick mishaps that involve garbage disposals, chainsaws, deadly bathtub spigots and the like.
  Negative
Even routine car accidents are staged to  make the impact seem at once tragic and silly.
  Negative
But the kills aren't enough to  distinguish the film, much less save it.
  Negative
The violent scenes might play  as outrageous, in midnight movie fashion, if the direction were  capable of putting an intention, any intention, across.
  Negative
Instead, the bloodletting plays  as leaden and self-important, as if we're supposed to be deeply  horrified by what the film shows us and come away thinking about it.
  Negative
I laughed at it, not because it's disturbing or deliberately hilarious, but because the movie seems blissfully unaware of what it wants to do, or could do.
  Positive
If you like this kind of thing, the " Final Destination" series does it  better.
  Negative
The movie is almost worth seeing for the scenes where the  heroine's dad reconnects with his love of the saxophone and blats out  obviously prerecorded instrumental stylings that sound like smooth jazz  in the vein of Kenny G. Here, at long last, is the bone-chilling horror  you were waiting for.
  Negative
