  Neutral
Anything but a rom-com.
  Neutral
She does not smile until an hour and  minutes into "Love at First Fight," a new French rom-com, directed by  Thomas Cailley.
  Positive
It's a bold and refreshing choice to have the lead character in a rom-com be this uningratiating, and this deadpan.
  Positive
The screwball dames of the s may have had their quirks, and certainly gave as good as they got in any linguistic battle, but they didn't hold out as long as Madeleine does.
  Negative
Madeleine's out-of-place quality is what gives "Love at First Fight" with the much better French title "Les Combattants" its tension and humor.
  Positive
All of the familiar rom-com tropes are here, but they feel up-ended, twisted inside-out.
  Negative
Stereotypical gender roles are almost completely reversed.
  Neutral
Cailley who also co-wrote the script with Claude Le Pepe keeps that tension activated beautifully and humorously the film is very funny, until almost the very end.
  Very positive
Madeleine and Arnaud Kevin Asas "meet cute" during a self-defense class held on the beach of their little seaside town.

At first Arnaud refuses to fight her "I don't hit girls" but eventually they start wrestling and she treats it as though she is in training for a "Rambo" movie.
  Negative
He's mortified by the experience, but, of course, as the title says, he falls in love with her immediately.
  Negative
Who was that unsmiling ferocious blonde in a racing swimsuit and cargo pants who had me in a glorious choke-hold in front of all my friends?Arnaud works in the family business carpentry, biding time until he knows what he wants to do with his life.
  Negative
That's the case with all of the young adults in "Love at First Fight."
  Neutral
They've dropped out of college.
  Neutral
They have nothing to do.

  Negative
She is convinced the entire world is doomed, and in a matter of years civilization will end entirely.
  Negative
Only the strong will survive.
  Neutral
To prepare, she puts raw fish through a blender, and drinks it like a smoothie.
  Positive
At a dance club with Arnaud, she rolls her eyes at the "dance floor sluts," silly girls devoted to silly lives.

  Neutral
She dropped out of her Master's program and is planning on joining the Army.
  Positive
She wants to be a Ranger, because their training is the most difficult.

  Negative
"Well.
  Neutral
This is cheerful," remarks Arnaud's mother.
  Negative
But Arnaud is enraptured.
  Negative
He finds Madeleine funny.
  Positive
Madeleine is funny.
  Positive
Arnaud mentions he likes cats at one point, and she says bluntly, "Do you know if you die, your cat will eat your face in  days?"
  Negative
The tension of the unknown future is intensified by the presence of a brightly-colored recruitment van for the French Army, parked by the beach boardwalk, holding workshops, signing people up.
  Negative
Arnaud has already made the decision to be a woodworker like his recently-deceased father, but upon meeting Madeleine he thinks maybe he wants to join the Army too.
  Negative
Just to be with her!
  Neutral
She barely seems interested in him as a potential mate, and probably considers romance superfluous in the end-of-world scenario of her dreams.
  Negative
But the two of them sign up for a two-week training camp where they will live in barracks, play paintball war games, and go through physical training exercises.
  Negative
Madeleine assumes she will be the best at the camp since her entire life is already a training montage.
  Positive
But things don't go as planned.
  Negative
The camp isn't rough enough for her.
  Negative
She's upset that her bed is clean and nice.
  Positive
The fact that they eat in a cafeteria is disgusting to her.
  Negative

  Negative
How can love blossom with such a creature?
  Neutral
Does Arnaud know what he's getting into?
  Neutral
He's such a sweet and shy person and she's such a powerhouse.
  Positive
Both actors give incredibly charming and funny performances, never betraying their characters by condescending to them, or over-playing the "quirks."
  Positive
The way Arnaud looks at Madeleine helps us understand how to perceive her, and Adele Haenel manages to suggest that Madeleine is, in actuality, a funny and sweet person herself, but has chosen to button all that up in the name of being realistic.
  Positive
She has "seen the light," and if nobody else has, well, that's too bad, at least she's prepared for the apocalypse.
  Negative
Cailley's direction is confident and un-fussy it is his first feature with sparks of intense beauty deep blue and black night scenes, waves of smoke filling the sky from a nearby forest fire reflecting the mood of any given scene.
  Very positive
He has an excellent eye for behavior, and an excellent ear for dialogue.
  Very positive
What matters in a movie like this is the relationship.
  Positive
Cailley understands that, and keeps his approach simple and transparent.
  Positive
The final sequence of "Love at First Fight" swerves into melodrama and adventure, with a sudden re-assertion of traditional gender roles that practically reaches the level of damsel-in-distress-tied-to-railroad-tracks.
  Positive
Some may be disappointed by that development.
  Negative
I wasn't, because by that point the real heavy-lifting had been done: the characters were so established, and the investment in their strange little romance was so strong that it could not be destroyed.
  Negative
When these two characters finally kiss, it really meant something.
  Positive
And when Madeleine suddenly turns to Arnaud, late in the film, throwing a huge happy smile his way, I realized how effective "Love at First Fight" really had been.
  Positive
It's not that she had been holding that smile back in the earlier scenes.
  Negative
You don't feel that way at all: although Haenel's performance is extremely funny, the character's humorlessness seems to go to the center of her being.
  Negative
But the circumstances of the unfolding story, Madeleine's experiences over the course of it, her friendship with Arnaud, all have mixed together to make that big smile possible.
  Negative
And best of all, the character is not compromised.
  Positive
Madeleine remains herself.
  Neutral
Arnaud wouldn't have it any other way.
  Negative
That's kind of beautiful, if you really think about it, and so is "Love at First Fight."
  Positive
