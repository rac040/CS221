Being poor in this country is considered a crime, and it always has been.
  Negative
The perceived sin of poverty is supposedly committed by those who are just too shiftless and lazy to pull themselves up by their bootstraps and succeed.
  Negative
Never mind that those bootstraps may have been Krazy-Glued to the concrete by institutionalized racism, class warfare and the redlining of neighborhoods' in the jaundiced eye of politicians and the wealthy, we all start from equal footing and the reason were not all rich is because were just not as motivated.
  Negative
So its important that one of the many things filmmaker  Ronit Bezalel points out in her insightful documentary  Acres in Chicago: Cabrini Green is that, despite ones attempts at success, there were forces that strove to tamp down ones ascendance.
  Negative
Nowhere is this more prevalent than in ones living arrangements: where a person resides is determined by numerous corruptible factors beyond their control.
  Negative
The restriction of where a certain type of people could live is what begat Cabrini Green.
  Negative
The famous Chicago housing project was built as a separate area to house the influx of African-Americans migrating from the South.
  Negative
Since space was limited, the city built upward, creating the familiar high-rise structure that many inner-city projects took.
  Negative
Cabrini Green became its own separate entity from the city of Chicago, with its own police force and a sense of community that arose as much out of necessity as it did out of logistics.
  Negative
The narrator describes Cabrini Green as just one mile from Downtown Chicago, yet in a whole nother economic dimension.
  Negative
Its  acres, bordered by North Avenue, Halsted Street, Chicago Avenue and Orleans Street, were a piece of real estate worth salivating over, provided it could be reshaped.
  Negative
Acres points out that Cabrini Green rose from the ashes of a prior, similarly impoverished neighborhood called Little Sicily, a place filled with Italians, Jews and Blacks, none of whom could legally live anywhere else.
  Negative
The city of Chicago uprooted the denizens of Little Sicily in the same way it would uproot Cabrini Greens inhabitants  years later.
  Negative
In both instances, the newer housing came with a different, more stringent set of rules that prohibited many from returning to their old neighborhood.
  Negative
The only difference here is that, while many of the Italian and Jewish people were able to move into the White neighborhoods, their former Black neighbors still could not.
  Negative
Those people went to Cabrini Green, which, as the documentary opens, is being converted to the mixed income housing that many displaced residents wont be able to move into either.
  Negative
Acres in Chicago: Cabrini Green continues Bezalels -year look at Cabrini Green, and one of the films strengths is its casual depiction of the passage of time.
  Positive
For example, we meet a teenager named Raymond McDonald who is a little older and wiser every time we check in with him.
  Neutral
Raymonds story is the film in microcosm.
  Neutral
Hes present at every step of Cabrini Greens conversion.
  Neutral
At the beginning, we see him and his fellow high school classmates asking Chicagos Mayor Daley how he would feel about being removed from his own neighborhood.
  Negative
We then see him in a botched interaction with some new White residents of the first section of mixed-income housing They dont want me here, he says to the camera.
  Negative
Later, we see that his successful dog-training business has become a casualty of the increasingly strict rules of the new houses, rules that affect the lower-income residents far more than their new neighbors.
  Positive
We also follow Mark Pratt and Deirdre Brewster, older residents who as activists speak out about the changes as they occur.
  Negative
Though the film runs a too-short  minutes, it speaks volumes about gentrification and the concept of mixed-income housing, the latter of which feels like a social experiment slowly going awry.
  Negative
In theory, says Mark Joseph, an associate professor of Community Practice, the most basic thing this is supposed to do is reconnect those living in public housing to the rest of the community.
  Negative
The results are middling at best.
  Positive
One new neighbor throws block parties that are barely attended by a mix of different income residents, and those who do tend to stay in their own groups.
  Negative
Also, as the film progresses, we notice that those former Cabrini residents lucky enough to transition over have become fearful of the conditions stacked against their favor.
  Negative
Any bad behavior, real or imagined, complained about by the neighbors will result in eviction.
  Negative
To live here, you need to be a nun, one resident says regarding the numerous new rules regarding safety.
  Negative
One of these rules states that if you have any kind of criminal record even a misdemeanor, you are not allowed to live in the new houses.
  Negative
One woman describes how her -year-old daughter, who had been arrested for fighting in school years prior, could not live with the rest of the family.
  Negative
If you have a record of any kind, another resident says, and in Cabrini Green its very likely somebody in your family does, you wont be living in the new Cabrini Green.
  Negative
Bezalel does a very good job editing many years of footage together, telling her story through the interactions of politicians, residents and the educators who provide historical context.
  Positive
She stands back, offering no solutions while letting the viewer draw his or her own emotional conclusions.
  Negative
Joy, sorrow and anger exist above and below the surface, but  Acres never forces ones response.
  Negative
I am sure that my own experiences seeing my hometown undergo a similar transformation teased out a higher level of anger in me than some viewers may feel.
  Negative
Cabrini Greens demolition began in  and ended in  with the last tower being demolished.
  Negative
Acres presents a New Orleans-style funeral for that last building, with a drumline of musicians playing, and former residents coming back from all over the U.S. to attend the send-off.
  Negative
One former resident, who has moved out to the suburbs, tells us that, despite the safer environment he currently inhabits, he is not as comfortable as he was in Cabrini Green.
  Negative
There was violence, he says of the projects, but there was also a sense of community that surrounded you.
  Neutral
This notion of dealing with the Devil we know is what a lot of pro-gentrification advocates completely miss.
  Negative
This film connects the current for your own good characteristics of todays gentrification with its prior, more overtly racially motivated and classist incarnations.
  Negative
The elevation of one poor neighborhood forces the ouster of its residents and the creation of another.
  Negative
The cycle continues, and the circle remains unbroken.
  Neutral
