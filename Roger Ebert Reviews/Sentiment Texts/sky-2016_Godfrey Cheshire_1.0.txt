When  Fabienne Berthauds Sky opens, were with a French couple in a black Mustang convertible flying across some cinematically over-familiar scenery in the American West.
  Negative
Theres desert, cactus, blazing sun and endless sky.
  Negative
Bad rock music blasts on the soundtrack.
  Negative
Her blonde mane flutters in the wind as she leans back in her seat.
  Negative
She has a camera and they sometimes stop for her to take photographs.
  Positive
Hes the kind of guy who thinks he looks tough, and no doubt does on the banks of the Seine.
  Neutral
These first few minutes suggest a particularly risible kind of bad European movie: the kind where the characters come to the far West of the U.S. and encounter little beyond clichs and boorish melodramatic situations from the realm of cultural fantasy, much of it of course deriving from a lifetime of watching American movies.
  Negative
Are the French especially prone to this kind of unintended silliness?
  Neutral
Sky almost seems determined to prove they are.
  Neutral
The thing is, its also the sort of awful movie that in some ways isnt half bad.
  Negative
Its craftsmanship is solid throughout.
  Positive
The acting is decent, sometimes better.
  Very positive
And it has the advantage of many road movies in that its constant movement, changes of scene and unexpected twists at least keep you awake.
  Positive
Better this, you think, than the same nonsense played out over Gauloises in a cramped Left Bank apartment.
  Positive
The screenplays lameness, though, announces itself early on.
  Negative
In a scene that obviously references one in  Five Easy Pieces, the couple are at a diner and Richard  Gilles Lellouche grouses no ice!
  Negative
at a waitress who brings him a glass of water.
  Neutral
It seems to take a long minute for the waitress to return with ice-less water.
  Negative
Then, put out that he cant have eggs after  a.m., he morosely orders a club sandwich and later bitches to Romy  Diane Kruger about the number of dressings hes offered.
  Negative
She says she like the choice.
  Neutral
You think: is this the best they could do to establish the guys Gallic boorishness blather about ice water and salad dressing?
  Negative
Granted, his boorishness soon becomes more blatant.
  Negative
That night, Richard gets drunk in one of those archetypal roadside honkytonks that all movies like this have, and chats up two blonde women.
  Negative
Exasperated, Romy returns to their motel room.
  Positive
When Richard comes in, he tries to rape her.
  Negative
She smashes him over the head with a lamp and hits the road, sure that shes killed him.
  Negative
Thus does the road movie turn into a solo act.
  Neutral
Romy overpays for an old clunker and soon ends up in Las Vegas low on cash.
  Negative
Taken in by a sympathetic aging showgirl  Laurene Landon, in a standout supporting performance, she gets a job wearing a bunny costume and selling photos to tourists alongside two Elvis impersonators.
  Negative
If that conceit sounds about as lame as ice water and salad dressing, well, so it is.
  Negative
Somewhere in here Romy actually says, I just want to be free.
  Negative
For a half-minute you want to believe her, and await a story that details her journey toward self-determination.
  Positive
But then guess what happens.
  Neutral
Of course: she meets a guy.
  Neutral
A sexy, long-haired park ranger named Diego Norman Reedus.
  Positive
He invites her up to his room and offers her two hundred dollars.
  Neutral
Since shes wearing a bunny costume, he naturally assumes shes in business.
  Negative
When she blushingly insists otherwise, he bluntly tells her he only sleeps with prostitutes.
  Negative
It avoids the burden of commitment.
  Neutral
So Romy exchanges a boorish French lout for a hunky American one whos relationship-phobic?
  Negative
Well, yes: thats about the sum of it.
  Negative
The rest of the story concerns Romys returning home with Diego and trying to worm her way into his life talk about a thankless task.
  Negative
And this isnt presented as any sort of examination of some womens penchant for making one bad romantic mistake after another.
  Negative
In fact, it seems were supposed to read Romys journey as somehow worthwhile, even successful: her self-abasement is her self-realization.
  Neutral
If that sounds politically very retrograde, a kind of anti-feminist fable, it comes across mainly as bad screenwriting, romantic clichs imbued with a particularly French kind of cluelessness.
  Negative
As  Inglourious Basterds proved, Kruger is a very skilled, charismatic actor, and here she carries the movie with some able help from the laidback, laconic Reedus.
  Positive
There are also some good performances in secondary roles from  Lena Dunham,  Lou Diamond Phillips,  Joshua Jackson and Qorianka Kilcher.
  Positive
Even so, the movie kept reminding me of  Albert Brooks in Lost in America setting out to bent on touching an Indian.
  Negative
And that was before Romy actually ended up touching one.
  Positive
