Orson Welles famously said that, in preparing to direct  Citizen Kane, he studied the Old Masters:  John Ford, John Ford and John Ford.
  Negative
In the work of Spains  Pedro Almodvar, an innovator whos also a cinema-classicist, one can detect the influence of various masters, from  Alfred Hitchcock to  Douglas Sirk.
  Negative
But at this point we must also recognize another master associated with his oeuvre: Almodvar himself.
  Positive
Julieta, Almodvars  th  feature and his best, in my view, since  Volver a decade ago, is a film of such quietly assured mastery that it reminds you American cinema today has virtually no one comparable to him: an artist who exercises total control over his work, employs a filmic idiom derived largely from the lushest productions of classic Hollywood, and operates in a fictional realm of his own creation.
  Positive
Granted, hes no longer as fashionable as the post-modern provocateur of Matador, Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown and Tie Me Up!
  Negative
Tie Me Down!
  Neutral
Yet the mature mastery of Julieta exhibits a higher, more refined level of accomplishment than those films, as must be recognized by anyone who doesnt confuse youthful insouciance with real artistry.
  Negative
Surely, any filmmaking teacher trying to instruct a class of young Orson Welleses today in the subtleties of film craft could find few models better than Julieta.
  Negative
Like most Almodvar films, this one centers on women.
  Positive
Its narrative premise can be simply stated: a woman faces the painful mystery of her long alienation from her daughter.
  Negative
But this is only the germ of a drama that grows steadily richer, more resonant and complex as the filmmaker elaborates it.
  Positive
As usual for Almodvar, the film opens with images that feel strikingly significant.
  Positive
We see folds of rich red fabric swaying against each other, almost like the bodies of lovers.
  Negative
What seems inscrutable, though, is soon revealed to be the gown of Julieta  Emma Surez, a middle-aged, middle-class woman who soon takes a small sculpture and swathes it in bubble wrap.
  Negative
At home in her chicly minimalist Madrid apartment, shes soon visited by the man in her life, Lorenzo  Daro Grandinetti, who wants to discuss their upcoming vacation to Portugal.
  Negative
But this is a getaway thats not to be.
  Negative
Thats because her seemingly happy and settled life is suddenly derailed by a chance encounter.
  Positive
One day, she runs into a very fashionable young woman who says she has seen Julietas daughter at Lake Como and that she now has three kids.
  Negative
Stunned by this news, which signals that its been a long time since mom saw her progeny, Julieta falls into depression, finding her mind thrown back into the past.
  Negative
Three decades earlier, Julieta now  Adriana Ugarte, an attractive and adventurous classics teacher, sets off on a nocturnal train trip that will change her life.
  Positive
When an older man tries to chat, she flees to the bar car, where she meets Xoan  Daniel Grao, a handsome young fisherman.
  Positive
The two make love that night, but something else happens: the man she first met commits suicide creating a spark of guilt that will take other forms later in the story.
  Negative
Its a story that ranges over many years and various locales.
  Neutral
When Julieta moves in with hunky Xoan in his pretty Galician seaside cottage, she finds life complicated by the proximity of a beautiful female artist friend of his  Inma Cuesta and a Mrs. Danvers-like housekeeper Almodvar regular Rossy de Palma who seems to resent anyone elses happiness.
  Positive
Julieta and Xoan have a daughter, Anta, who has a happy childhood.
  Positive
But after family disruption propels a move to Madrid when the girl is a teen, an abyss begins to open between her and her mother.
  Negative
A while later, Anta leaves home for a retreat in the Pyrenees, and when Julieta goes to pick her up, shes told her daughter no longer wants to see her.
  Negative
She discovered her life lacked a spiritual dimension and has found something she missed: faith.
  Positive
I must confess that Ive been very up and down about Almodvars films over the years, but one of the pleasures of following his work is seeing how he continues to evolve.
  Positive
No film is just like any other.
  Negative
Of this one, he has said in the film's press notes: Ive contained myself very much in the visual composition, in the austerity of the supporting characters.
  Negative
No one sings songs.
  Neutral
Nor do I introduce scenes from other films to explain the characters.
  Neutral
There isnt the slightest trace of humor, or any mixing of genres, or so I believe.
  Negative
From the outset I had in mind that Julieta is a drama, not a melodrama, a genre to which Im partial.
  Negative
A tough drama with a hint of mystery: someone whos looking for someone without knowing why she left.
  Neutral
That gives a concise picture of some of the qualities that set Julieta apart from others of his films, but austerity shouldnt be taken to mean that hes gone all Bressonian us.
  Neutral
Theres a luxuriance to both the storytelling and the visual manner of the film, but its a luxuriance without flamboyance or cheekiness.
  Neutral
Almodvar stages scenes economically and elegantly, in such a precise way that they could indeed be used as classroom examples.
  Positive
Along with cinematographer  Jean-Claude Larrieu and editor  Jos Salcedo, his collaborators include composer  Alberto Iglesias, whose haunting score I think is the best Ive heard in a movie this year.
  Negative
The two actresses who play Julieta deserve commendation, both for their individual excellence and for the way that Almodvar blends their performances.
  Negative
Honestly, when watching the film, I couldnt be sure whether I was seeing two women or one transformed by makeup and special effects.
  Positive
That almost uncanny seamlessness is a marvel in itself.
  Positive
Almodvars script was based on three stories by  Alice Munro, and for a while he considered making it in her native Canada.
  Negative
That he ended up back in Spain is of course altogether fitting.
  Negative
He may share Catholic roots with Hitchcock and Bresson, but this films concern with guilt, transference, fate, mystery and more obliquely faith connects intricately with his native culture as well as the ideas expressed in his previous films.
  Positive
Building on his previous work while also charting a new course, it is suffused with the casual confidence of an established master.
  Very positive
