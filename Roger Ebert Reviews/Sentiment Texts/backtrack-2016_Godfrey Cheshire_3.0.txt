Like the psychic boy of  The Sixth Sense, the haunted hero of  Michael Petronis Backtrack sees dead people.
  Negative
Hes not so quick to recognize them as such, though' audiences might more readily pick up on the insinuating clues.
  Negative
Psychiatrist Peter Bower  Adrien Brody, after all, practices in a hushed office that seems located in the Australian precincts of the Twilight Zone, and his patients, if not composed of shimmery give-away ectoplasm, are all decidedly odd.
  Negative
Theres a stodgy middle-aged musician who claims to play in a club that Bower knows closed many years ago.
  Negative
The guy thinks its  and that Ronald Reagan is president.
  Negative
Others under Bowers care evince similar chronological delusions.
  Negative
But the oddest is a hooded girl named Elizabeth Valentine  Chloe Bayliss, who appears with the unannounced alacrity of a spirit and seems to harbor a terrible secret.
  Negative
Troubled, Bower seeks advice from his friend and psychiatric mentor Duncan the venerable  Sam Neill.
  Negative
Even before their first conversation takes place, we learn that Bower is staggering through life carrying a heavy load of guilt.
  Negative
Not too long before, his little daughter Evie was killed in a roadway accident when he was momentarily distracted.
  Negative
The dead daughter motif will remind some of  Nicolas Roegs far creepier Dont Look Now.
  Negative
Duncan readily grasps the sign that this tragedy and Bowens current perplexities are connected: Elizabeth Valentines initials contain Evies name.
  Negative
Before long, the mounting weirdnesses he faces propel Bower back to his small hometown, where all the previous references to  begin to add up.
  Negative
Though he has blocked the memory from his mind, that was the year when  people were killed in a horrific train wreck outside the town.
  Negative
Looking at newspaper clippings about the accident leads Bower to the realization that theres a connection between his recent caseload and the trains list of passengers, which included one Elizabeth Valentine.
  Negative
Theres more.
  Neutral
Bower was a teen in  and he and a friend were out spying on a Lover's Lane near the train tracks when the accident happened.
  Negative
Could they have had something to do with it?
  Neutral
And why doesnt he get any help with his investigations from his surly, alcoholic dad William George Shevtosv, who was the police chief assigned to investigate the crash?
  Negative
There are several further levels of discovery and mounting horrors beneath the ones described above, such that every guilty secret in the story seems to hide other, more drastic ones under it.
  Negative
Psychiatrists speak of screen memories, uncomfortable and often false recollections that disguise more deeply painful actual memories.
  Negative
Backtrack is like a layer-cake of those, a conceit that has the upside of keeping the viewer engaged with trying to puzzle out the storys deeper truths, but the downside of recalling too many other movies that have played similar games in more startling and innovative ways.
  Negative
Petroni, in any case, is a skilled storyteller with a strong visual sense.
  Very positive
Even before the tale takes us back to Bowers hometown and its fateful train tracks, trains become an omnipresent visual motif, one that seems much as in Hitchcocks  Strangers on a Train to suggest all the complicated, and potentially catastrophic, connections between the characters.
  Negative
The directors way of handling action is similarly deft, usually relying on carefully orchestrated atmospherics that are only occasionally goosed with horror-movie shock cuts.
  Negative
Along with excellent work by cinematographer  Stefan Duscio and composer  Dale Cornelius, Petroni elicits sharp performances from his estimable cast, especially Adrien Brody.
  Positive
Sporting a very credible Aussie accent, the actor easily proves that his elongated visage and deep-set eyes are ideally suited to the supernatural-horror genre, especially characters able to see deep into dimensions too scary for other mortals.
  Negative
