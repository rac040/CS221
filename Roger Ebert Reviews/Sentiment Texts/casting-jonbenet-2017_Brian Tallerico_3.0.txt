Casting JonBenet is not what you expect.
  Negative
It is not like the dozens of true crime episodes of shows like Dateline NBC or  Hours that have analyzed the most famous unsolved murder of the s ad nauseam.
  Negative
With the  th  anniversary of the murder of JonBenet Ramsey still ringing in our ears,  Kitty Green tackles not the details of the case but how we have responded to and almost interacted with it.
  Negative
Why is the world so obsessed with the death of a little girl in Colorado?
  Negative
Why does everyone have a theory as to who did it and why?
  Negative
To get at these questions, Green uses a similar approach to that employed by  Robert Greene in his excellent  Kate Plays Christine, viewing the case through the eyes of a group of actors auditioning to play the roles of John, Patsy, JonBenet, and other key players in this American drama.
  Negative
Their performances offer their personal impressions of the murder: one person plays John as completely innocent' another thinks hes protecting someone in the house.
  Positive
We even see actors auditioning to play Santa Claus, as one theory posits that the Christmas partys Kris Kringle may have been involved.
  Negative
Its almost the inverse of a traditional crime doc.
  Neutral
Whereas crime docs typically seek to offer everything that is known about a crime, Casting JonBenet proves how little we will ever understand about that night.
  Negative
Green has a methodical, fascinating approach that intercuts auditionsinterviews with brief snippets of what could be called the final product.
  Neutral
So, we hear from around a dozen women auditioning to play Patsy Ramsey, all offering their personal stories as well as theories on who Patsy was.
  Negative
And then we see clips of them playing out key moments in the crime, such as the press conference with John and Patsy or the horrible moment when John found his daughters body.
  Negative
We never hear from anyone else.
  Negative
There are no experts or officers, just people who answered the call to be players in a recreation of the murder of a child.
  Negative
Of course, everyone has a theory, and they range from the common Patsy was mad over bedwetting and her punishment got out of control to the extreme John was involved in a child sex ring and that night was his turn to give up his daughter.
  Neutral
As the film progresses, the auditions become more like confessionals.
  Negative
A man speaks about finding a dead body, and how that would play into his performance as John.
  Neutral
A woman speaks about yelling at her child after bedwetting.
  Negative
Another actress admits to being abused as a child.
  Negative
And it dawns on us that the reason we are so obsessed with the mystery of JonBenet Ramsey other than it having that elusive quality of being unsolved is that we can relate to some part of it.
  Negative
We see our own darkness in stories like this and imagine how we would respond to the horror.
  Negative
Seeing this tale recreated and analyzed over and over again almost allows us to deal with our own nightmares.
  Negative
Green saves arguably her greatest achievement for last.
  Positive
In a way I wont spoil, she essentially layers all of these stories, theories, and performers on top of one another, revealing again how no one knows exactly what happened.
  Positive
The world of true crime is an incredible industry.
  Positive
There are whole networks devoted to shows that recreate the worst days of someones life.
  Negative
Why do these shows keep getting made and why do we watch them?
  Negative
Kate Plays Christine gets deeper into the morality and sanity of it all, but Casting JonBenet is a nice companion to that film, further investigating our national obsession with what is ultimately an unknowable truth.
  Negative
