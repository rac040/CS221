"The November Man" is a strange and frustrating movie.
  Negative
It seems to want to be a James Bond or Jason Bourne picture: the kind of film in which car chases are tracked by satellites and drones, assassins cut down bushels of henchmen while barely batting an eye, and good and bad guys alike seem to just magically appear, a la  Christopher Nolan superheroes, wherever the plot needs to them to be.
  Negative
At the same time, it wants to be a John Le Carre-type espionage drama, set in a version of reality and mixing allusions to real-world geopolitical traumas including Russian-Chechnyan conflict and CIA black ops into the heroes' derring-do.
  Negative
The movie's snarling, R-rated-tough-guy worldview which includes graphic shootings, knifings, rapes, and sexist insults sits uncomfortably with the movie's desire to be a late-summer thrill ride.
  Neutral
"The November Man" wants to be taken seriously, except when it doesn't.
  Negative
This creates viewer whiplash.
  Positive
The movie is confused and often untrustworthy .
  Negative
The movie opens with a brief flash-forward.
  Negative
Government assassin Peter Devereaux  Pierce Brosnan blasts his trainee, David Mason  Luke Bracey, for disobeying orders in an operation that was supposed to thwart an assassination but ended up causing a child's death.
  Negative
Five years later, David is ordered to kill aformer Russian double-agent named Natalia played by Mediha Musilovicwho broke into the office of thesoon-to-be-elected president, Arkady Federov  Lazar Ristovski.
  Negative
Why?
  Negative
Without giving too much away, let's just say that the CIA is up to no good, as is so often the case in movies and life, and that a self-interested power broker inside the agency wants to prevent the information that Natalia stole from getting out and embarrassing the agency.
  Negative
Unfortunately for whoever did this, Devereaux has a deep bond with Natalia.
  Negative
He embarks on a mission of revenge that also requires him tofind a young woman named Alice Fournier  Olga Kurylenko and prevent her from being killed by his former student David or by Russian agents including Amila Terzimehic'sAlexa, a leggy mute whose stare could burn holes in concrete.
  Negative
Meanwhile, David tries to thwart or kill his old mentor as the film itself jokes, he has daddy issues while grappling with the suspicion that his lethal proficiency and loyalty are being abused for selfish purposes, in an off-the-books CIA operation whose outlines he can't discern.
  Negative
Nobody in the cast makes much of an impression except for the old pro character actors and Brosnan, who is perfectly cast as Devereaux.
  Positive
Handsome and lean but grey and haggard, he has twenty years' worth of experience playing these sorts of men, starting with his version of James Bond, a colder, more self-loathing version of Ian Fleming's super spy than fans were used to seeing.
  Positive
"I might as well ask you if all those vodka martinis ever silence the screams of all the men you've killed, or if you find forgiveness in the arms of all those willing women for all the dead ones you failed to protect," another agent asked in " Goldeneye."
  Negative
"The November Man" is based on the seventh in a long-running series of novels about Devereaux by  Bill Granger, but there are times when it seems to be a direct answer to that question, which Brosnan's Bond answered with a knowing, faintly sad look.
  Neutral
Devereaux is a highly functioning alcoholic who downs hard liquor the way other people drink water, and he admits to Alice that he has no life to speak of' he's just a warm-blooded cipher living as far off the grid as he can, and trying to keep his personal relationships secret from the global espionage community so that they cannot be used against him.
  Negative
At one point Devereaux, who apparently quit the CIA out of slow-building revulsion, lectures his former pupil on the need for moral clarity, telling him that you can be a man or a killer of men, "but not both, because one will eventually extinguish the other."
  Negative
This is all intriguingly regretful and angry stuff.
  Negative
It's not at all the sort of thing you normally encounter in the sorts of films where people beat each other senseless in basements and make spectacular kill-shots while sailing through the air unloading handguns.
  Negative
Donaldson, who directed Brosnan in " Dante's Peak," is an unheralded master of down-and-dirty violence.
  Positive
The film's most brutal moments have a sting that has largely disappeared from Hollywood movies.
  Negative
When people get shot or stabbed or hit in the face with a blunt object, the audience gasps as if it happened in front of them on the street.
  Neutral
That sort of visceral intensity isn't easy to conjure for viewers who think they've seen everything.
  Negative
But it's all in the service of an ultimately retrograde, cartoonishly macho vision of lone heroes doing what lone heroes do, so it's hard to accept as anything other than a means of dressing up Bourne-style mayhem with a world weariness that the Bourne franchise did with more conviction.
  Negative
Movies about assassins and gunfighters and other killers who come out of retirement for one last mission often try and fail to solve this insincerity problem.
  Negative
The characters pay lip service to the notion that being a paid killer rots the soul which is surely true but nobody who bought a ticket wants to see them practice nonviolent resistance and play "Kumbaya" on a ukelele.
  Negative
"The November Man" knows this on some level, but it still genuflects in the direction of LeCarre, like a sneaky delinquent impersonating a scholar.
  Negative
It doesn't actually regret violence, but there are moments when it seems to regret having to pretend to regret it.
  Negative
An old-school, Schwarzenegger-style bloodbath would've been more honest.
  Negative
"The November Man" also fails to earn the power it summons whenever it shows us scenes of people threatened with torture, or bloodily maimed, or raped.
  Negative
At first you may think it's a movie set in a sexist world, but soon enough you figure out that the film itself is sexist.
  Negative
When David's superior officer  Bill Smitrovich barks slurs at a female subordinate, at one point addressing her as "tits," the moments are treated as tension breaking laugh lines.
  Negative
A sexually abused character seeks revenge by trying to seduce her abuser, and Donaldson's camera caresses the lines of her cocktail dress, adopting the POV of her target's lustful guards.
  Negative
A sweet innocent becomes collateral damage and suffers mightily' the film takes the character's fear and physical pain seriously for a scene or two, whereupon that character vanishes from the story and is never seen or heard from again.
  Negative
The movie fails to develop the most important people in Devereaux's life as characters, even obliquely, until the movie needs to terrorize or kill them to jack up suspense and sympathy.
  Negative
Despite occasional humanizing moments, including a shot which confirms thatKurylenko can actually play piano, the movietreats everyone as cannon fodder.
  Negative
Sam Peckinpah, this ain't.
  Negative
