"Dear White People" made me think of an alternate title: "And That's Why They Call It Race."
  Negative
The negro and Caucasian Ivy League University students in Justin Simien's comedy are all competing to be the first and best across various societal finish lines, either to attain higher status or to solidify it and pass it on to one's offspring.
  Negative
From a certain vantage point, all this elite jockeying and politicking is exhausting to behold.
  Negative
Ivy League institutions are where many of America's leaders and innovators are farmed, but the process includes a certain amount of sandbox childishness.
  Negative
It's fortunate that, like " The Social Network," "Dear White People" is so charismatic in form and style that we easily forgive its surfeit of priviliged narcissists.
  Positive
And, while the tone here is broader and brassier than that of  David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin's Harvard rhapsody, we eventually get to see much further beyond the surface of these calculating, thin-skinned brats, to an intensely sensitive and searching core.
  Negative
You can see it in the eyes of  Tessa Thompson, who plays mulatto campus radical Samantha White with such implosive rage and heartache that her closeups feel like grand set pieces.
  Neutral
"Dear White People" gets incredible mileage out of Thompson's personaility along with her dizzying beauty and that of her co-star, Tyler  James Williams "Everybody Hates Chris".
  Positive
Williams isn't the leading man, but he quietly leads the film.
  Neutral
As oddly Afroed, gay Lionel, he plays a character we never see in movies, a shy, offbeat young Negro whose awkward social navigation invites as much sympathy and identification as laughs.
  Negative
Such a watchful, introspective character, when Caucasian, naturally assumes the role of Unlikely Hero.
  Negative
When Negro, he is either a non-entity or a joke.
  Neutral
In "Dear White People," he simply stands for any Negro kid who finds himself adrift in a sea of cliques and types that reserve one predetermined slot for his kind.
  Negative
In a sweet little reverie, he imagines himself fitting in smoothly with the Caucasian kids and then with the Afrocentric crowd, his hairstyle and clothing changing to suit each reality.
  Positive
Yet neither are his reality.
  Negative
There are no easy heroes or foils in this briskly cross-cutting ensemble piece, only blossoming adults and beleagured elders including  Dennis Haysbert, cast to type as a no-nonsense Dean of Students responding to a unversity economic crisis by standing their ground and sharpening their knives.
  Negative
Austerity breeds contempt.
  Negative
Two big events bookend the power plays and betrayals in between: A student government election complicated by House NegroField Negro politics of a distant era' and a racist theme party hosted by the movie's fictional equivalent of the Harvard Lampoon.
  Negative
Along the margins, a reality TV producer pulls some marionette strings.
  Negative
This is Obama era satire, but, in his visual storytelling, Simien is not joking.
  Negative
He's not content to work from the stale but persistent improv-mockumentary template that's been the state of the art fora decade--where the handheld camera flops around with a lack of conviction and worldview to match a gang of often Ivy educated comedy writers just bobbing for laughs.
  Negative
In contrast, Simien treats his own screenplay as if it were a slow-boiling neo-noir thriller, or, in its dapper sensuality, "  ."
  Negative
You could make a film geek party game out of guessing his influences.
  Neutral
There's the erudite-vernacular screwball dialogue of Wilder, Schulberg, Chayevsky and their funkiest disciple,  Spike Lee circa " He Got Game"-to-present.
  Negative
Certain Wellesian low angle shots of strident characters arrayed like superheroes of intolerance suggest "The Boondocks."
  Negative
There's also the brashness of very early Spike, particularly the campus cattiness of " School Daze" and the exuberant sexuality of "She's Gotta Have It"-through-" Jungle Fever."
  Positive
Lionel mentions his own love of  Robert Altman films--perhaps shared by the director, though his canvas, full as it is, rarely gets Altman-messy.
  Neutral
The dialogue is dense but rolls out as neatly as a " Dragnet" interrogation.
  Negative
Whether Simien drew on all or none of these influences, his vision seems to spring directly from what's up with his generation now.
  Neutral
A student election managed by one computer science major's smartphone app doesn't have an election day but an election minute.
  Negative
Apps, Tweets and YouTube channels round out this film's cast.
  Negative
They're as essential to the film's storytelling as phone booths and telegrams were back when Negro college students didn't exist in movies.
  Negative
The pressure to make a mark in a fickle campus society composed of walking social media profiles, but without doing anything to disgrace the legacy they've been entrusted, ultimately pushes these kids to the breaking point.
  Negative
It all falls apart at the film's climactic party.
  Negative
Vulnerabilities and complexeties come to light.
  Positive
Characters we never expected to gain any self-awareness suddenly hit a brick wall of truth.
  Negative
If it sounds like I'm talking around this film's supposed central subject, Race, I sho' is!
  Negative
This whole race thing is exhausting.
  Negative
Caucasians are generally as tired of hearing Negroes' race-based grievances as we Negroes are of being profiled, passed over for opportunities and murdered in the street with impunity.
  Negative
It's all so played out.
  Neutral
"Dear White People" agrees with me.
  Positive
It is as preposterously good-looking as its student government rivals and ex-lovers, Samantha and Troy  Brandon P. Bell, but never so lovely as in those moments where characters, overcome with spontaneous emotion, set aside their spiritual placards to engage on a human level.
  Positive
When Samantha and her new boyfriend, a somewhat dorky, analytical Caucasian teaching assistant Justin Dobies, argue volatile issues of race and representation in cinema while stepping out of their clothes to make sweet love, you might learn everything you ever wanted to know about race but were afraid to face.
  Negative
