Addicted to Fresno is such a mean-spirited, dull and silly movie that it buries its talented cast under the weight of a horrendous script that they cant possibly redeem.
  Negative
Much like the recent  Staten Island Summer, its a comedy with a great ensemble given almost nothing funny to do.
  Positive
Similar to that film, it makes one wonder why so many actors and actresses who should know theyre above this material chose not to be for a few weeks of filming.
  Negative
My guess is that the involvement of Jamie Babbitt propelled them to sign on the bottom line, as they likely worked with the excellent TV director on Married, Girls, Playing House, Drop Dead Diva, United States of Tara, The Middle or a dozen other hit shows.
  Positive
Babbitt is generally a confident, capable TV director, but she cant rescue  Karey Dornettos script from its misanthropic foundation.
  Neutral
This is a film mostly populated by awful people doing awful things that awful people only do in awful movies.
  Negative
Shannon  Judy Greer has moved in with her sister Martha  Natasha Lyonne after running away from rehab for sex addiction.
  Negative
Shes also been forced to get a job at the same hotel at which Martha works, run by Kristen Jessica St. Clair, and where she meets Marthas friendly co-worker Eric  Malcolm Barrett.
  Negative
Meanwhile, Shannon is sleeping with her married therapist Edwin  Ron Livingston while Martha struggles with a recent break-up and ignores the advances of Kelly  Aubrey Plaza, whos clearly romantically interested.
  Negative
What starts as a character dramedy a la  Sunshine Cleaning becomes something much different when Shannon decides to have quickie sex with a hotel guest  Jon Daly, and Martha bursts in on them.
  Negative
Shannon cries rape, Martha moves to defend her sister, and the guy ends up dead.
  Negative
Now, the sisters have to dispose of a body, which actually takes this sitcom-ish story to a crematorium and a Bar Mitzvah that the girls choose to rob.
  Neutral
Molly Shannon, Fred Armisen,  Kumail Nanjiani and Alison Tolman co-star in small roles.
  Negative
All should have known better.
  Neutral
There are so many unlikable characters and blatantly Look At How Edgy We Are joke topics here that its hard to keep track rape, addiction, murder, dementia, Downs Syndrome, etc.
  Very negative
Do you find these things inherently hilarious?
  Positive
Addicted to Fresno is for you.
  Positive
Using this kind of material for humor is certainly not impossible, but it does demand a difficult tonal balance that Dornetto cant manage.
  Negative
Its more often gross and off-putting than funny.
  Negative
Its like a stand-up comedian trying out their new, edgy material to the sound of clinking glasses and hearty sighs.
  Negative
Do you think an old woman in a birthday hat in a wheelchair saying poopy is funny?
  Neutral
Do you know anyone who does?
  Neutral
If so, you may want to find new friends.
  Negative
The cast is so talented that Addicted to Fresno gets more depressing as you realize how much theyre going to be wasted.
  Negative
There are a few moments in which that talent shines through the first scene between Greer amp' Shannon, a funny bit with Nanjiani, Armisen amp' Tolmans first scene but theyre almost instantly buried by material that falls flat.
  Positive
By the time the girls are planning to boost gifts from a Bar Mitzvah, my brain had completely checked out and gone somewhere more interesting, safer, and funnier.
  Positive
