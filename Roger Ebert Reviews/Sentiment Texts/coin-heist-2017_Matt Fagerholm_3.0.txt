Aided by her supportive parents and the creative community of Austin, Hagins was able to realize her dream several years before many of her peers attended their first day of film school.

Her remarkable first foray into directing was chronicled in the delightful  documentary, Zombie Girl: The Movie, which unfortunately resulted in her being viewed as more of an endearing curiosity than an artist to be taken seriously.
  Positive
Her third feature, s vampire satire My Sucky Teen Romance, is far from flawless, but it is also infinitely preferable to any of the Twilight pictures, and includes a hilarious scene with critic  Harry Knowles that drives a stake through the entire franchise.
  Positive
Unlike most filmmakers who strain to recall their memories of youth when tackling a coming-of-age yarn, Hagins was a teenager when she made My Sucky Teen Romance, thus allowing her to portray life precisely as she observed it in the present tense.
  Negative
I cant recall another vampire film that depicted so amusingly the sheer awkwardness of adjusting to ones fangs, as if they were yet another pitfall of puberty.
  Negative
What makes Hagins a singular talent is not just the freshness of her perspective, but its wholehearted earnestness.
  Positive
She is entirely uninterested in utilizing the sort of edgy tropes designed to boost the hipness factor for teen movies, and that is partly because there isnt a mean-spirited bone in her body.
  Very negative
A glimpse at the premise for her fifth feature, Coin Heist available now on Netflix would suggest that it were a mere retread of  The Breakfast Club.
  Negative
Elisa Ludwigs book, upon which the film was based, even had an ad labeling its four teenage protagonists as The Perfect Student, The Slacker, etc.
  Negative
One of the finest achievements of Hagins adaptation is that none of her main characters can be defined by a reductive label.
  Negative
They are weary of the stereotypes that befall kids like them in most high school movies, very few of which seem to understand the insecurity that fuels so much adolescent behavior.
  Negative
Rather than deliver snappy one-liners with the verbal dexterity of sitcom veterans, these kids often talk in a flat affect while fumbling for the right words.
  Negative
This approach could threaten to become bland in the hands of a less skilled filmmaker, but Hagins now twice the age she was when she made her debut keeps her audience engaged by making each scene ring true.
  Negative
Its amusing to simply observe the boredom exuded by a class of teens from a Philadelphia prep school when they are forced to take a field trip to the U.S. Mint Do they make credit cards here?
  Neutral
one kid asks.
  Neutral
Excitement finally pervades the ennui when the principal is taken away by police, arrested on charges of embezzling  million from the schools endowment.
  Negative
This sudden twist jolts the sleepy-eyed demeanor of the principals son, Jason, played by  Alex Saxon as a soft-spoken loner not at all pleased with his Spicoli-esque reputation.
  Negative
He earns the empathy of Alice  Alexis G. Zall, an expert hacker who hatches a plan to steal from the U.S. Mint in order to save the school.
  Positive
Jasons ex, Dakota  Sasha Pieterse of Pretty Little Liars fame, wouldnt normally associate herself with illegal schemes, but now that the schools debt has resulted in the cancellation of all extracurricular activities and the relegation of the Winter Formal to the cafeteria, she eagerly joins the pair in planning the heist.
  Very negative
Rounding out the foursome is Benny  Jay Walker, who once applied his skill at manufacturing IDs to help illegal immigrants.
  Negative
Though the elaborate undertaking would make even the " Ocean's Eleven" crew balk at its difficulty, Hagins maintains a suspension of our disbelief for much of the films running time, while building palpable thrills in some nail-biting set-pieces, particularly during the second half.
  Negative
The films believability is strengthened, first and foremost, by the terrific young actors, two of whom are clearly poised for stardom far beyond the realm of online celebrity.
  Very positive
Viewers who know Walker from the uproarious sketch comedy in his Vine videos will be stunned by the restraint and textured nuance of his work here.
  Negative
When Benny learns that his promised scholarship has been discontinued due to lack of funds, the look of disillusionment on Walkers face is just heartbreaking.
  Negative
It is an excellent performance, as is the one delivered by Zall, embodying the essence of what has become the signature, semi-autobiographical Hagins heroine: a sensitive, sweetly nerdy soul with a limitless reservoir of resourcefulness.
  Very positive
Its no surprise that Zall is effortlessly natural in front of the camera, considering that she achieved popularity with her charming YouTube series devoted to demystifying the strangeness of everyday life, from weird foods to crowded film sets.
  Negative
Yet whereas her exuberant Internet persona is reminiscent of  Ellen Pages Juno, Zalls portrayal of Alice is more evocative of  Jena Malone in its understated vulnerability.
  Positive
Coin Heist should finally put to rest any nagging perceptions of Hagins as the little zombie girl armed with a camera and a gallon of fake blood.
  Neutral
She is the real deal, and deserves to not have her work graded on a patronizing curve.

The most appealing thing about her latest film is its sense of indignation aimed at adults who have cheated the system while expecting others to follow the rules.
