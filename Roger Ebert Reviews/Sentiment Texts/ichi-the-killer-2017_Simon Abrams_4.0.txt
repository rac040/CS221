The most exciting thing about Well Go USAs re-release of Ichi the Killer, Japanese cult filmmaker  Takashi Miikes gory, dark gangsterhorror-comedy, is that this perversely funny, and unsparingly disgusting genre-melting film now looks and sounds better than it has any right to.
  Positive
The new digital restoration of Ichi the Killer allows viewers to notice the films seams, especially computer-generated blood spatter, and the fake-looking make-up that define the appearances of lead actors  Tadanobu Asano and  Shinya Tsukamoto.
  Negative
This is fitting since Ichi the Killer is about the disappointment and potentially seductive power of violence, and the nightmare of being simultaneously drawn in, and alienated by images of men hurting women as a means of indirectly hurting themselves.
  Negative
Mikes film, a rambling adaptation of  Hideo Yamamotos manga comic book, follows Kakihara Asano, a sadomasochistic mobster, and his roundabout quest to find, and either kill or be killed by Ichi Nao Ohmori, a nebbish and reluctant assassinserial killer who leaves all of his victims with their guts draped across the furniture, and dripping from the walls.
  Very negative
Miikes essential gross-out is now paradoxically more approachable than ever since it looks more mundane, surreal, and artificial than ever before.
  Negative
Its a wonderful poison apple of a gore movie, one whose half-attractive, half-repulsive charms make it a fitting apology and celebration of its directors frequently jarring use of extreme violence.
  Positive
The plot of Ichi the Killer is kind of unimportant, and ultimately headache-inducing since its a long, episodic adaptation of a multi-volume comic book.
  Positive
Still, the film often feels like a put-down of the Japanese mob dramas of the past, and a prediction of the American serial killer procedurals that would follow.
  Negative
All you really need to know is: Kakihara is a social-climbing sadist who becomes increasingly unhinged after his boss Anjo goes missing.
  Negative
In his search for Anjo, Kakihara discovers Ichis existence, and decides that he must meet, and fight him.
  Negative
Ichi, on the other hand, is a self-aware, but deeply conflicted hot mess.
  Negative
His handlermentor Jijii Tsukamoto uses that messiness to his advantage, and sics the troubled Ichi on anybody he doesnt like.
  Positive
Unfortunately, Ichi is coming off of his leash more and more lately.
  Negative
And nobody can put him down once he starts biting.
  Negative
Almost everybody is a funhouse expression of Ichi since he personifies conflicted macho insecurity, a recurring fixation throughout Miikes best andor weirdest gangster films, like Gozu and Graveyard of Honor.
  Negative
Kakihara is basically what Ichi might have become if he didnt feel so bad about being a monster.
  Negative
So Kakihara is flamboyant, and even sexy because of the fake scars on Asanos face, his self-assured body language, and his characters charmingly garish punk wardrobe, including a purple satin jacket, and a red flannel suit.
  Negative
But Kakiharas also pissy and dissatisfied because he hasnt found anybody that can show affection to him by hurting him.
  Positive
There are also secondary characters like identicaltwin crooked cops Jir and Sabur both played  Suzuki Matsuo,who dress alike because they want to be in each others skin.
  Negative
And mob bodyguard Kaneko Hiroyuki Tanaka, a frustrated father figure who unwittingly stumbles into Ichi, and assumes hes as harmless as he only superficially appears.
  Negative
And Kanekos biological son Takeshi Hiroshi Kobayashi, who idolizes Ichi because Ohmoris character saves him from a group of bulliesby eviscerating them with a blade hidden in his shoe.
  Negative
Even Jijii Japanese derogatory slang for old man is guilty of projecting his desires onto Ichi: hes responsible for implanting false memories in Ichis head in order to convince Ichi that the only way he can express his pent-up sexual urges is through violence.
  Negative
Unfortunately, Ichi is, despite often seeming introverted and helpless, much uglier than anyone could anticipate.
  Very negative
He peeps on women, and matter-of-factly states that he wants to rape some of them.
  Negative
Part of Ichi thinks hes a victim, but another part knows he isnt.
  Positive
So he grins a ghastly, hilarious smile before he slices up women who court him, and men who want to be him.
  Positive
But he keeps right on killing because of Jijiis fake memories, represented through jarring, elliptical flashbacks to acts of rape, schoolyard bullying, and domestic abuse.
  Negative
Picture the grimace-like grin that frequently graces Kyle McLachlans face when he plays Dougie Jones in Twin Peaks: The Return, and you get the idea of what Ichis soul is like.
  Negative
In fact,  David Lynchs recent projects might be a productive gateway into Ichi the Killer.
  Neutral
Imagine if Lynchs equally episodic and surreally traumatizing  Inland Empire werent about Hollywoods tendency of brutalizing women, and were instead about the self-destructive orbit created by and for manly men.
  Negative
Try, then, to conjure up a film where blood, offal, and other bodily fluids are sprayed across the screen for the sake of alienating you so much that you cant help but laugh with the filmmakers as they helplessly admit that they, like you, know that youre participating in a self-perpetuating cycle of transfixingnauseating violence.
  Negative
This is, after all, a movie whose title emerges from an inhumanly substantial puddle of ejaculate.
  Positive
Ichi the Killer is a grim, filthy comedy that uses horrendous representations of torture, and violence to call attention to the fact that Miike is just another conflicted merchantconsumer of violence.
  Negative
Consider the fact that Tsukamoto is not only a character actor, but also a filmmaker, and real-life inspiration inspiration for Miike.
  Negative
In fact, Tsukamotos groddy, seminal avant-garde punk fantasies, like Tetsuo the Iron Man and Tokyo Fist, are arguably the foundation that Miikes sizable filmography is built on.
  Negative
In this light, Jijiis hypnotism of Ichi takes on a new meaning, one thats confirmed in a scene where mob groupie Karen Ailen Sun asks Jijii point-blank if shes under the influence of his mesmerism.
  Negative
Tsukamoto stares at her, off-camera, for a while before re-assuring Karen that he hasnt hypnotized her.
  Negative
With this casting choice in mind, you might start to notice the omnipresent security cameras that everybody is watching everybody else with throughout the film.
  Negative
And you might start to see Ichis shocking, irruptive flashback fragments as hallucinatory emissions from a Videodrome-like pirate station.
  Negative
Even Miikes preposterous use of computer-generated special effects looks different in this light, especially in the scene where he awkwardly sutures Tsukamotos head onto an unbelievably buff body-builders frame frame when Jijii reveals his body after undressing.
  Negative
Whether you love or hate Miikes film, you wont find better conditions to watch Ichi the Killer under than Well Go USAs new re-issue.
  Negative
Everything old and ugly looks newer and more depraved.
  Very negative
What a pain, such a pleasure.
  Positive
