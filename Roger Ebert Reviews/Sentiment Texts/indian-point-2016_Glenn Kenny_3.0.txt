One of the first people the viewer meets in Indian Point is Brian Vangor, a nuclear engineer whos been working at the Indian Point Energy Center, a nuclear power plant, for almost  years.
  Negative
Vangor is, as nuclear power plant workers go, kind of the anti-Homer Simpson.
  Positive
Soft-spoken, knowledgeable, conscientious, calm.
  Negative
He is the Senior Control Room Operator at the plant and he seems to know well what hes on about.
  Negative
Hes the kind of guy, in other words, who you definitely want overseeing such an operation.
  Positive
And he believes in what he does.
  Positive
This technology has its problems, he asserts, But show me a technology that doesnt.
  Negative
Of course, the potential problems of nuclear energy are decidedly different from any other form of energy.
  Negative
This point was brought home by the multiple meltdowns at Japans Fukushima plant after an earthquake and attendant tsunami in .
  Negative
Japan, and the world, is still feeling the effects of that disaster, and the event gave new motivation and energy to the residents of the town Indian Point.
  Positive
Just thirty miles away from the New York metropolitan area, the Indian Point plant is operated by a company called Entergy, and its license was up for renewal shortly after the Fukushima event.
  Negative
Writerdirector Ivy Meerpools engrossing documentary profiles local activists and journalists in this case, specifically, an activist and a journalist who are also a married couple while looking at the bigger picture via the story of Gregory Jaczko, the onetime head of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission who, by this movies reckoning, was forced out of his position by a ginned-up scandal after his post-Fukushima recommendations for safety chafed the actual energy industry.
  Negative
Meerpools movie is scary without being alarmist' it notes, of course, the fact that Indian Point has operated without a Fukushima type event for over two decades, but it also quietly says that SHOULD a Fukushima type event ever occur there, I myself probably wont be around to write a review thats critical of nuclear energy.
  Negative
While the profiles of folks like Vangor provide a certain even-handedness, the movie does have an agenda, and its helped when someone like Jim Steets, the spokesman for Entergy, shows up on screen.
  Negative
Hes very professional, maybe too professional: were one in the mood to be unkind, one would note that his whole manner practically screams corporate hack in mere nanoseconds.
  Negative
Jaczko, on the other hand, is portrayed as a conscientious public servant whose initial mission was hardly to rule out the nuclear option, but who is persuaded by what he witnesses in Japan to say, at one point, Maybe we need to shut down all the plants.
  Negative
Interesting idea, given that there are almost  online in the world now.
  Positive
Even as it evokes terrifying dangers, the movie holds out hope.
  Negative
As Jaczko points out, even as space-age energy goes, nuclear is pretty old-school and probably on the way out.
  Negative
On the other hand, the energy industry as its currently constituted is digging its heels in: it wants what it wants, and productively moving forward is not really a priority.
  Negative
This, combined with things such as spent fuel pools, which this movie describes in some disquieting details, are invoked by the filmmakers to send a message to the viewer: change isnt going to happen without constant citizen vigilance and activism.
  Very negative
