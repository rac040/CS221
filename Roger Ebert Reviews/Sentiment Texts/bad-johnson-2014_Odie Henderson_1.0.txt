I once saw a movie about a talking vagina.
  Neutral
It had a Colonel Sanders-style van Dyke and a voice like  John Huston.
  Neutral
No explanation was given for its sudden loquacity, and none was needed' this was porn.
  Negative
But the beard was a nice touch, and the voice talent nailed the honeyed tones of Noah Cross.
  Positive
Despite its sinister, " Chinatown" line readings, our Chatty Coochie got lots of suitors because, at the right time and the right place, most people are capable of anything.
  Positive
And also because this was porn.
  Negative
Still, I must commend the filmmakers for their attempts at cleverness.
  Positive
No such commendation is forthcoming for the makers of "Bad Johnson," as they dont have a clever bone in their creative bodies.
  Negative
This is an astonishingly bad film whose protagonists penis does more than just talk.
  Negative
It falls off and grows its own complete human form.
  Negative
This is a step further than Doris Dorries  film, "Me and Him," where  Griffin Dunnes junk stayed attached and spoke to him in the far less threatening voice of Cousin Larry from TVs "Perfect Strangers."
  Negative
I wasnt crazy about that movies boring, erudite, philosophical schlong, but at least it didnt try to throw its owners girlfriend off a roof.
  Negative
"Bad Johnson" is the latest in a series of "comedies" afraid of women, gays and minorities.
  Negative
Each of those groups gets a chance to be humiliated by the filmmakers, with relationship-seeking women bearing the brunt.
  Negative
It follows yet another man-child as he wreaks unfunny havoc by mocking those who do not look or think like him.
  Negative
The ladies find him irresistible, failing to see hes a real dick who will abuse and mistreat them.
  Negative
Why actresses take roles in dreck like this Ill never know.
  Negative
The money must be fabulous.
  Negative
Our hero this time is  Richard Johnson  Cam Gigandet, "a charismatic womanizer" according to the summary on IMDB.
  Positive
Predictably, the movie opens with its hero banging the wrong woman.
  Negative
He is then caught by a parade of several other women hes sleeping with, including an older woman who looks as if shed rather be in another movie, perhaps listening to Griffin Dunnes ding-a-ling discuss Aristotle.
  Negative
Anyway, one of Richs angry conquests kicks him in the balls so hard that they lodge in his stomach and stay there.
  Negative
I thought this might be the catalyst for his penis falling off, but even if it were, this film would be too scared to show the offending member.
  Negative
Plus, that would be a clever way to set this story in motion: Angry woman kicks off guys wiener, and it turns into some random hipster!
  Negative
Alas, it stays connected for now, and Rich has to wait six weeks before he can resume sexual activity.
  Positive
"Bad Johnson"s idea of a Meet-Cute is Rich hooking up with a woman trying to buy a pregnancy test.
  Negative
Rich explains how she can cheat the test, which would be completely useless if its positive.
  Negative
The test seeker, Jamie  Jamie Chung, finds all of this charming and begins to date him.
  Positive
Six weeks later, on his way to finally consummate his relationship with Jamie, Rich crashes into a cougars BMW.
  Negative
Said cougar exchanges more than her insurance information with Rich.
  Positive
Now, I dont give a damn how good that gecko on TV is to your pocketbook.
  Negative
If some guy in a piece of crap car hits your brand-spanking new BMW, you are not going to give him oral pleasure.
  Negative
Youd be sending his nuts back up into his stomach with your Manolo Blahnik.
  Negative
But wait!
  Positive
That would be funny!
  Positive
So its not happening in this movie.
  Negative
Jamie discovers Richs infidelity and kicks him out.
  Negative
Taking a page from the equally terrible " The Change-Up," Rich makes a wish hell regret the next morning.
  Negative
He wishes for control over the body part he keeps blaming for his philandering.
  Positive
His pillipecker disappears the next morning.
  Neutral
Dont ask me how, but it winds up in an alley across town.
  Negative
Taking the guise of a naked  Nick Thune, the penis calls Rich collect and details his location and lack of clothes.
  Negative
Rich picks him up, then introduces him to his personal trainer buddy, Josh  Kevin Miller.
  Positive
Josh is frowned upon by Rich and the movie because Josh is in a committed relationship.
  Positive
He befriends Richs whooziwatzit and discovers he likes him better than Rich.
  Negative
Joshs relationship with Richs penis could have been pumped for commentary about the unspoken homoeroticism in many cinematic bromances, but the movie has less interesting things to do.
  Negative
Castrated Rich starts a new relationship with Lindsay Katherine Cunningham, a female client at the gym.
  Positive
As he falls for her, his penis gets weaker.
  Negative
Whoring good!
  Positive
Relationship bad!!
  Negative
To combat this, Richs one-eyed worm turns criminal.
  Negative
First, he tries to screw Lindsay, then he kidnaps her with murderous intent.
  Neutral
When Rich tries to save her, the tables are turned as his pud starts to pound on him.
  Negative
Thune looks as if he can break Gigandet in half, and I wish he had' it would have spared me "Bad Johnson"s incredibly uninspiring rooftop climax.
  Negative
I thought Id get a few cheap thrills out of "Bad Johnson," as Ive a taste for raunchy comedy.
  Negative
But this movie isnt even dirty.
  Negative
Randiness is replaced by pathetic attempts at humor involving flamboyantly gay waiters and questionable insults towards Asians.
  Negative
Jeremy Tetreaults screenplay has the unmitigated gall to justify his white protagonist calling an innocent Japanese restaurant delivery boy "Tokyo Drift" with the old "I had an Asian girlfriend, so I cant be racist!"
  Negative
standby excuse.
  Negative
Who thought this would go unnoticed?
  Neutral
Who thought it would be funny?
  Neutral
The gay waiter is so over-the-top I expected to discover he was a puppet controlled by Wayland Flowers.
  Negative
But he does get a line that sums up how I feel about "Bad Johnson."
  Negative
Looking at Rich, he says "you aint even all that!"
  Neutral
"Bad Johnson" suffers from the worst case of creativity shrinkage Ive ever seen.
  Negative
