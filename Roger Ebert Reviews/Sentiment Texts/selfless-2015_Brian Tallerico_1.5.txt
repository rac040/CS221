Filmmakers have struggled with the definition of what it means to be a human being for decades.
  Positive
Are you merely a product of flesh and bone?
  Neutral
Do you believe theres a soul?
  Neutral
Or is your mind the most definitive aspect of your existence?
  Neutral
From  Rod Serling to Seconds to silly body switch movies like Freaky Friday, the consideration of the human body as a shell, one that can house a persona other than your own, has fascinated some of our most creative voices.
  Positive
And when it was announced that a visually striking and philosophically ambitious filmmaker like  Tarsem Singh  The Fall was going to wade into these waters himself, there was reason for notable optimism.
  Negative
Which makes the result, Selfless, all the more frustrating.
  Negative
"Selfless" is a bland, generic product that almost defiantly refuses to explore the complex issues which it raises, perhaps in an effort to appeal to a wider audience.
  Negative
The narrative outline of Selfless is a philosophical theme park, readymade for daring, complex filmmaking.
  Very positive
And Singh and his writers never go on any of the rides.
  Negative
Damian Hale  Ben Kingsley is an uber-wealthy New York businessman, the kind who appears to have chosen to cover his entire, lavish apartment in gold one day, simply because he was bored.
  Negative
Sadly, all the wealth in the world cannot defeat the cancer thats killing him, nor can it reunite a bitter man with an estranged daughter  Michelle Dockery.
  Very negative
Hale receives a mysterious business card that promises him a future that his body cannot.
  Negative
He meets with an obviously nefarious scientistCEO named Albright  Matthew Goode, who tells Hale about shedding, a process that allows someone to discard their broken body for a new, genetically grown one, for a cost of only  million.
  Negative
Hale signs up.
  Neutral
After going through a visually dull process and heres where you start to wonder why Tarsem didnt make different aesthetic choices, and not for the last time, Hale wakes up in the body of  Ryan Reynolds.
  Very negative
Hes given a new name Edward and relocated to New Orleans, where life appears to be exactly what he wanted.
  Negative
He drives a fast car, plays basketball, and even makes a new friend  Derek Luke.
  Negative
The one hitch is that Edward has to take a little red pill at the same time every day or risk hallucinations, migraines and even death.
  Negative
After missing just one pill, Edward has a detailed hallucination that feels more like a flashback, and discovers that this body was not grown in a lab.
  Negative
It belonged to a family man who sacrificed himself to pay for treatments to save his daughters life.
  Neutral
He finds Edwards family, including an expectedly-startled wife played by  Natalie Martinez, and learns the truth about his new life, a truth that Albright and his suited cronies will do anything to keep secret.
  Positive
Clearly, this is thematically dense stuff, from the way the  uses the desperate needs of the poor to their own advantage to a reliance on pharmaceuticals to stay happy and alive.
  Negative
Yet every time Selfless feels like its going to actually explore one of those themes and give them more than lip service as plot details, it pulls back to standard, genre fare, both narratively and visually.
  Negative
Selfless is one of those depressing affairs that gets less and less interesting as it progresses.
  Negative
The opening scenes of opulence in Hales penthouse have a strong visual aesthetic empty rooms like empty minds waiting to be filled but that disappears in the seemingly neverending second act, during which Selfless sags and never recovers, feeling at times more like a failed cable TV pilot than a film.
  Negative
With its hallucinations, questions of identity, and philosophical resonance, its simply inexplicable that Selfless becomes as visually engaging as a CSI spin-off.
  Negative
Perhaps Tarsem was reined in by producers who didnt want their Ryan Reynolds Vehicle to become Artsy, but they made a fatal error.
  Negative
At  minutes, and with a narrative that telegraphs every twist a half-hour before it arrives, Selfless needed a visual language that it just doesnt have.
  Negative
And that lack of personality isnt replaced by anything.
  Negative
Reynolds isnt bad but he seems to have been directed to play Edward just a tick north of bland, which isnt exactly his strong suit.
  Negative
Someone here needed to realize that a movie this conceptually crazy needed to be fun.
  Neutral
Movies like  FaceOff are enjoyably ridiculous in large part due to the fact that  Nicolas Cage, John Travolta and  John Woo KNEW they were ridiculous, laughing and winking at the audience throughout.
  Negative
Selfless is played on a straight line, never nearly as much fun as it could or should have been.
  Negative
Who knew immortality could be so boring?
