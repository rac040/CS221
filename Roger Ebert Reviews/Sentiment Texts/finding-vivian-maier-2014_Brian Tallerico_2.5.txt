In the opening scenes of Jeff Maloof and  Charlie Siskels Finding Vivian Maier, its titular subject is described as paradoxical, bold, eccentric, and other words that get at the fact that the men and women who were closest to Maier in her time on Earth didnt really know much about her.
  Positive
In , Maloof was working on a book about his Chicago neighborhood and longed for the right archival photography.
  Positive
A flea market junkie from a young age, he took a risk at an auction, bidding on a box of negatives that he never ended up using and shoved in a closet.
  Negative
Two years later, he developed them out of curiosity and discovered a woman now considered one of the best photographers of the  th century.
  Positive
When the best of Maiers work first appears in the film about her, the quality takes your breath away and sends chills down your spine.
  Positive
She was a true talent.
  Very positive
And yet Maloof and Siskels film presents an interesting moral quandary along with its profile of an amazing photographer.
  Positive
When does creative ability and the desire to share a true artists eye trump what has to be considered an invasion of privacy?
  Positive
The story of Finding Vivian Maier progresses from Maloofs auction find to his scanning the developed photos into a Flickr account and realizing that he wasnt alone in his assessment of Maiers talent.
  Negative
And so he went after the rest of the story, trying not only to find the rest of the negatives but Maiers back story, and how it impacted her photography.
  Negative
Immediately, significant questions haunted Maloof.
  Negative
Why did she never show her work to anyone?
  Negative
Why did she shoot over , photos, most of them from a box camera that she always carried around her neck and could surreptitiously use to capture her subjects?
  Negative
And whats the point of taking so many photos if no one sees them?
  Negative
When Maloof discovers that Maier recently passed and is allowed access to her storage unit, a portrait of a hoarder becomes more clearly defined.
  Negative
She didnt just take , photos.
  Positive
She kept receipts for decades, collected trinkets, stacked newspapers to the point that her floor sagged.
  Negative
She rather quickly goes from eccentric to mentally ill, especially when stories of her relative disregard for many of the children she nannied come into focus.
  Positive
One family speaks about the photos she took when one of her wards was hit by a car and the behavior turns to honest mental and physical abuse later in life.
  Positive
She often gave fake names and some claim she used a fake accent.
  Negative
She wanted to be hidden, private, and reclusive.
  Neutral
Just because she once looked into selling photos doesnt change the mountain of behavior that suggests that she saw her negatives and photos as something else to fill the storage unit of memories.
  Negative
And now all of that is being torn down.
  Negative
The argument has been made that Maiers photos are fair game because she didnt destroy the negatives.
  Negative
She didnt destroy ANYTHING.
  Neutral
She kept receipts buried in trinkets in envelopes in boxes.
  Neutral
And the film raises the question of privacy regularly with people who knew Maier commenting on how much she would have loathed this investigation into her life and Maloof wondering aloud if hes gone too far.
  Negative
Sadly, the filmmakers brush it off by answering the question with their fascination with this odd, talented outsider artist.
  Negative
Curiosity is used an excuse to invade privacy.
  Negative
Not good enough.
  Neutral
If they had taken a strong stance and simply stated that art is meant to be shared and displayed no matter the artists wishes, I might have actually agreed.
  Negative
But the invasive nature of Finding Vivian Maier is only briefly given lip service and never adequately handled within the filmthe creators supposedly have dealt with the issue elsewhere but this is a review of whats in the film itself and not supplemental material.
  Negative
Is it possible to love the art but disagree with the way its presented?
  Neutral
Vivian Maiers photography is absolutely incredible and now that its been unearthed and her past has been investigated, her talent should be appreciated.
  Positive
And so Im incredibly torn about Finding Vivian Maier overall.
  Negative
Should Maloof and Siskel have opened a door that a dead woman so clearly wanted locked?
  Negative
Id say no or they should have done so with more authority and artistic justification instead of just glossing over the issue with "But isn't she interesting?"
  Negative
.
  Neutral
And yet now that its open, it cant be closed again.
  Positive
Perhaps when Maloof posted those photos on Flickr, there was no turning back.
  Negative
And oh is it ever fascinating what is behind that door.
  Positive
