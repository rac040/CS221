Ditching the twisting high concepts of works like  Unknown amnesia!
  Positive
and  Non-Stop one flight!
  Positive
, action star  Liam Neeson and director Jaume Collet-Serra have crafted their most satisfying work to date by sticking to a tried-and-true crime movie template, and allowing a talented cast and tight production values to be the only high concept they need.
  Positive
Run All Night isnt perfect, but its surprisingly satisfying on its own terms, elevated by a better-than-average ensemble and some razor-sharp editing to cut through any nagging questions about the plot.
  Positive
More than hes been allowed to do in either Collet-Serra vehicle before this one, Neeson gets to portray a real character here, a man who may have once had a particular set of skills but has seen then dulled by age, regret and whiskey.
  Very negative
Run All Night is proof that quality action films dont really need to reinvent the wheel each time out as long as they make it spin this smoothly.
  Negative
Jimmy Conlon Neeson used to be a notorious mob enforcer.
  Negative
If he knocked on your door, you knew you were in trouble.
  Negative
Rumored to be behind over a dozen murders at the behest of the infamous Shawn Maguire  Ed Harris, Conlon doesnt have much left to live for.
  Negative
Hes the guy who wakes up in the bar the next morning and just starts drinking again, forced to beg Shawns son Danny  Boyd Holbrook for money and drunkenly play Santa Claus at the Maguire Christmas party.
  Negative
The man who once was feared is now openly mocked by a younger, tougher generation of bad guys.
  Negative
Jimmy also lost all touch with his son Mike  Joel Kinnaman, who is trying to live a straight life as a limo driver with his wife  Genesis Rodriguez and two kids with a third on the way.
  Negative
The first act of Run All Night is really the arc of two sons one trying to get away from the criminal underworld and one diving as deeply as possible into it.
  Negative
As Danny, the very talented Boyd Holbrook is all twitchy, nervous energy, the kind of dangerous sociopath who seems capable of doing whatever it takes to gain the respect of his father through criminal notoriety.
  Negative
To that end, he brings heroin into their world.
  Positive
Dad says no, but Albanian heroin dealers dont like to be pushed out of a possible criminal enterprise.
  Negative
It just so happens that the dealers hire Mike to drive them to a meeting with Danny that goes horribly awry.
  Negative
Before you know it, Danny is dead, and Mike is a target of everybody in the criminal underworld, including a high-priced assassin played with effective cool by Common, and only his estranged dad can keep him safe till morning.
  Very negative
Neeson does arguably the best work of his action career here in that he captures a man who doesnt just pop to life as a killing machine again but has the muscle memory to get the job done one last time.
  Positive
Jimmy may stumble through subway tunnels but he can still choke a man out and fire a perfect shot when he needs to.
  Negative
And the actor rises above the potential clich of the criminal redemption arc in the way he doesnt allow the potential melodrama to sink into his portrayal.
  Negative
His take on Jimmy is a man doing what needs to be done, not necessarily to right the wrongs of the past but because theres nothing else he can do at this point.
  Negative
And watching Neeson and Harris in scenes together, especially a great, tense meeting in the middle of the piece, is a surprising joy.
  Positive
Theyre both great here in that neither overplays the hero or villain archetype.
  Positive
Jimmy, the good guy, is a murderer, while Shawn, the bad guy, is emotionally mourning the loss of his child.
  Very negative
They are far more complex than they would have been in the hands of other actors.
  Neutral
Run All Night is also subtly elevated by a top-notch team behind the camera, especially editor  Craig McKay, a two-time Oscar nominee for  Reds and  The Silence of the Lambs.
  Positive
For at least an hour, Run All Night hums to be fair, theres a bit of a sag in the middle and the entire piece runs too long at nearly two hours.
  Negative
But take note of the way  McKay and Collet-Serra orchestrate a great sequence in a subway station, creating a rhythm between the cops trying to find Mike and the bad guys coming after Jimmy.
  Negative
Or look at the great car chase scene, which is shot in a bit too much close-up as are a few of the fights, but has a visceral pace to it that makes it impossible to look away.
  Neutral
Or watch one of the final sequences in a train yard and the way it perfectly fits together to build tension.
  Neutral
Theres a tempo to Run All Night that really serves as the entertaining foundation of the whole film, and its what so many boring action films lack.
  Negative
Some of Run All Night doesnt make a lot of sense and I wished for a little more grit and a little less polish in some of its darker beats although viewers should be warned that this piece doesnt shy away from extreme violence at times.
  Negative
Theres also a fine line between entertainment and being a bit too on-the-nose when you choose to set a shoot-out in an Irish bar to The Pogues, but the film had won me over by that point.
  Positive
And thats when you really know an action film has worked overall when its flaws are beaten down like the guys who choose to cross Jimmy Conlon by what works.
  Negative
