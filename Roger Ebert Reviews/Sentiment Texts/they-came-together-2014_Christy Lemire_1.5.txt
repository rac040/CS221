"They Came Together" means to make fun of romantic comedies the way "Airplane!"
  Positive
goofed on disaster movies and the "Naked Gun" films spoofed detective flicks.
  Very negative
The result is actually more in line with  Gus Van Sants ambitious but ill-advised shot-for-shot remake of "Psycho."
  Neutral
Director and co-writer  David Wain and his usual band of comic pals essentially have made a straight-up romantic comedy.
  Positive
Certainly this could not have been the plan.
  Neutral
Wain and co-writer  Michael Showalter, who gave teenage sex comedies similar and superior treatment in s " Wet Hot American Summer," obviously intend to parody the clichs and formulas that make so many films in the genre seem so interchangeable.
  Negative
Its got all the moments and beats youd expect the meet-cute, the instant hatred that turns to flirtation, the perky montage of trying on clothes, the contrived misunderstanding that keeps the couple apart and finally mercifully the mad dash to a wedding for some very public, last-minute I-love-yous.
  Negative
But simply recreating what we know to be hackneyed and safe doesnt suddenly make it hilarious and surprising.
  Positive
There has to be a spin to it' there has to be some innovation.
  Positive
Anyone who has seen a movie starring  Julia Roberts,  Jennifer Aniston or  Kate Hudson can recognize whats going on and find a chuckle here and there.
  Negative
But mostly, the results are shockingly unfunny and sadly lifeless, especially given the wealth of comic talent involved.
  Negative
Paul Rudd and  Amy Poehler star as the  Tom Hanks Meg Ryan types at the films center, recounting how they met and fell in love over dinner with an underused  Bill Hader and  Ellie Kemper.
  Negative
The latter couple is meant to serve as our stand-ins, trying to remain politely charmed by the increasingly inane details theyre hearing in extended flashbacks.
  Negative
The core of the plot plays like a knowingly cutesy version of "Youve Got Mail," but "They Came Together" also features recognizable rom-com nuggets ranging from "Pillow Talk" to "When Harry Met Sally..." Rudds Joel works for a giant, soulless candy corporation.
  Negative
Poehlers Molly owns a neighborhood candy shop thats "charming and adorable and impossible not to like," as she puts it.
  Positive
But wouldnt you know?
  Neutral
Joels company is trying to run Mollys store out of business.
  Negative
Can their affection withstand such stress?
  Neutral
And so we watch as they show up for a Halloween party dressed in the same costume and immediately clash.
  Negative
This is also where the film takes a painful, extended detour for a discussion of whether  Christopher Meloni soiled himself in his superhero outfit.
  Negative
Spoiler alert: He did.
  Neutral
We watch them fall for each other over books and coffee in an idyllic version of New York City which is like a character itself in their relationship, were told repeatedly, when such a convention should be clear.
  Negative
Throughout this familiar process, the jokes are either annoyingly repetitive or overly spelled out for us.
  Negative
Its obvious what theyre parodying the rom-com is an incredibly common type of clichd film' its tropes are well-known and well-worn.
  Positive
Still, its not enough for Molly to be adorably klutzy' the dialogue has to inform us that shes adorably klutzy in addition to showing her knocking over a bunch of her belongings in her bedroom before tumbling down a flight of stairs on the way to work.
  Negative
Joel cant just be commitment-phobic' he has to talk about how commitment-phobic he is with his regular basketball buddies  Ken Marino,  Jack McBrayer,  Kenan Thompson and  Jason Mantzoukas.
  Negative
And those guys cant just obviously represent different points of view on the matter, they have to articulate the fact that they represent different points of view on the matter.
  Positive
One joke went on for so long I thought something was wrong with the film like it was stuck or something.
  Negative
I wont bore you with the details here, but it has to do with a bartender uttering the phrases "Tell me about it" and "You can say that again" over and over as Joel drowns his sorrows.
  Negative
"They Came Together" clicks sporadically, though, when it takes a chance on totally absurd flights of fancy a weird date Molly has with her priggish accountant  Ed Helms, for example, or an awkwardly close moment between Joel and his grandma  Lynn Cohen.
  Negative
Even at  minutes, "They Came Together" feels like its conceit has been stretched thin.
  Negative
But a lot of these folks Wain, Showalter, Marino, Erinn Haynes are also involved with the series "Childrens Hospital" on the Cartoon Networks Adult Swim lineup, which sharply parodies the soapy doctor drama.
  Negative
Those episodes last just  minutes which is probably just the right amount of time for such scattered, sketch-based laughs.
  Negative
