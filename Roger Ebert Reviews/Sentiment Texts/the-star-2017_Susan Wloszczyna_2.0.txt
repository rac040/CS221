You know what would make the Nativity story so much better?
  Negative
Wise-cracking animated animals that save the day or so the creative team behind this holiday-themed family flick thinks.
  Positive
The critters apparently have waited far too long to be hailed for their participation on that special night.
  Negative
That appears to be the motivating factor behind The Star, a retelling of the first Christmas directed by  Timothy Reckart in a feature debut that might have its heart in the right place but cant quite manage to smoothly blend the spiritual with the silly without a few Biblical hitches here and there.
  Negative
The most awkward scene arrives early, introduced by the words Nazareth  months B.C.
  Negative
That at least made me smile.
  Positive
But then a young girl is visited by a glowing angelic-like presence that proceeds to announce that God has chosen her to bear his Son.
  Negative
Shock, awe, fainting any and all would be an acceptable response.
  Negative
Instead, she calmly takes in this news flash as if she was given a weather update and basically says thanks.
  Negative
I wanted to say, Honey, this isnt like being told that you won a free dinner for two at Olive Garden.
  Negative
This is THE Annunciation.
  Neutral
Act accordingly.
  Neutral
Granted, this Mary doesnt have much of a back story, though she has freckles and rivulets of raven hair.
  Negative
She seems nice, but the script gives little hint why she is so special.
  Positive
Most amusing is that she is voiced by  Gina Rodriguez, who plays Jane the Virgin on TV.
  Negative
Nothing like inside-joke casting.
  Negative
But, in short order, she is about to be wed to Joseph  Zachary Levi, Tangled.
  Negative
That leads to another uncomfortable conundrum when Mary tells her intended that, um, she is having Gods baby and he, lucky fellow, is going to help raise him or, rather, Him.
  Negative
The humble carpenter is understandably verklempt at first, yet remains devoted to his wife.
  Negative
The film is rated PG for thematic elements, which translates into pre-wedlock baby bump.
  Negative
You can practically hear a collective sigh of relief when this part of the story is over.
  Neutral
Besides, the couple, obviously a big deal in the source material, isnt the star of The Star.
  Positive
They take a backseat to a brash little donkey  Steven Yeun of The Walking Dead who has escaped from his grueling job at a mill that required him to be chained to a grindstone.
  Negative
He and bird buddy Dave the dove  Keegan Michael Key, blessed with the best jokes find a safe haven with Mary and Joseph.
  Positive
The lady of the house takes a liking to the beast of burden and names him Bo.
  Positive
The animals and humans dont actually talk to one another, Shrek and Donkey-style, and thank goodness for that.
  Positive
Meanwhile, the three kings are spied riding atop camels on their way to see Herod  Christopher Plummer.
  Negative
Again, four-legged characters steal the spotlight.
  Positive
While one of the Magi is voiced by controversial televangelist Joel Osteen, the hump-bearing steeds are performed by the show-business holy trinity of  Tyler Perry,  Tracy Morgan and  Oprah Winfrey.
  Negative
Perry is the bossy one, Morgan is the dumb one and Winfrey is the sensible one.
  Negative
The wise men unwisely alert Herod that a new king of the Jews is about to be born and he calls for a census in order to locate this rival ruler and destroy him.
  Positive
Around the time that Morgans dromedary resorts to a the king of the shoes gag is when I began to lose faith in this venture.
  Negative
Seconding that feeling is a hulking silent brute in an iron mask, looking like a rejected extra from  Mad Max: Fury Road, who is sent to do the bloody deed.
  Very negative
Eventually a whole menagerie puts in an appearance.
  Positive
That includes the thugs hench dogs  Ving Rhames and  Gabriel Iglesias and such stable mates as a horse  Kelly Clarkson, a cow  Patricia Heaton and a goat  Anthony Anderson.
  Negative
There are obstacles, physical confrontations and narrow escapes but everyone knows how this story will end with a  Mariah Carey Christmas song, of course.
  Negative
Lets at least applaud the diversity of the cast, although the fact we only hear them dilutes some of that impact.
  Neutral
Affirm Films, a faith-based branch of Sony, has plenty of experience mixing religion and Hollywood before with such releases as  Soul Surfer,  When the Game Stands Tall and  Risen.
  Very negative
But its telling that the makers of The Star felt the need to include a disclaimer during the end credits acknowledging the liberties they took with this cornerstone of Christian belief and assuring they meant no harm.
  Negative
This outing is a bit toon-deaf in how ittries having it both ways by mixing the holy with high jinks.
  Positive
There was mild applause following the packed public screening I attended.
  Negative
But kids in the crowd seemed be more interested in their concession-stand snacks during the early portions.
  Neutral
When it comes to delivering animated tidings of seasonal joy, give me the more subtle and better-told messages found in the holiday perennials A Charlie Brown Christmas and How the Grinch Stole Christmas instead.
  Negative
