When  fans of beloved character actor  David Morse say that they wish he could  star in his own movie, "McCanick" is not what they have in mind.
  Negative
As  directed by  Josh C. Waller and written by  Daniel Noah, the movie is a  tedious, often incompetently assembled mass of cop-on-the-edge clichs.

Morse  stars as the title character, a grizzled Philadelphia police detective.
  Neutral
The movie follows McCanick over the course of a single workday, his  thbirthday, as he rampages through the city, busting heads and  screaming threats.
  Negative
In theory, this chaos is in service of tracking down a  recently released felon named Simon Weeks  Cory Monteith, a street  hustler whom McCanick put behind bars seven years earlier.
  Negative
But it's  really in service of standard-issue dirty cop mayhem.
  Neutral
As  clumsily written flashbacks pile up, we piece together the bigger  picture of McCanick's history with Weeks: they met while McCanick was  investigating a politician's murder.
  Negative
McCanick's commanding officer   Ciaran Hinds hints that sleeping dogs should be let lie, but McCanick  won't listen' we discover the terrible secret that binds McCanick to  Weeks, but only after enduring a repetitive series of "searing"  confrontations between the hero and various perps, accomplices, and  random citizens, including a scene in which McCanick intimidates a  roomful of tough guys by playing "spin the pistol."
  Negative
There's  also an unremarkable mentor-pupil relationship, with McCanick training a  handsome young patrolman  Mike Vogel who does things by the book and  is appalled by the hero's can't-make-an-omelette-without-breaking-skulls  attitude.
  Negative
The movie seems content to alternate between imitating "Bad  Lieutenant" and imitating "Training Day," minus the genuine spiritual torment  of the former and the sleek preposterousness of the latter.
  Negative
With  his menacing bulk and soulful eyes, Morse lends the material more  dignity and heft than it deserves, and there are a few affecting moments  between him and Monteith, who died of a heroin overdose last year at  .

This is his final screen performance.

The movie has a suitably unsettling look, somewhere between a TV- cable police drama and a poverty row film noir.
  Positive
Waller and cinematographer Martin Alghren embrace darkness, favoring silhouettes and half-shadowed faces when they're justified, and sometimes when they aren't.
  Negative
A few scenes play much longer than you expected, generating an odd tension.
  Negative
You wonder: Are we still here because the filmmakers don't know when to quit, or because they're lulling us into complacency to set up a sucker punch?
  Negative
But none of these virtues compensate for the film's shallow, derivative script and direction.
  Negative
When a goon in the spin-the-pistol scene asks McCanick "what are you  Popeye f------g Doyle?"
  Neutral
it seems meant as a self-aware preemptive  strike against criticism, but it's merely descriptive.
  Negative
"McCanick" barely  has a frame it can claim as its own.
  Neutral
It shamblesin the shadows of similar but richer films, and never hits its own stride.
  Negative
