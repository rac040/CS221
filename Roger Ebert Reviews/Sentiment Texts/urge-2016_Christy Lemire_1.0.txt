Vapid, obnoxious New York party kids stumble upon a drug that delivers more than they bargained for in Urge, a movie thats as empty and unlikable as the characters themselves.
  Negative
With his feature-directing debut,  Aaron Kaufman has crafted a lean, mean little film thats stylish but soulless.
  Negative
Thats fitting given the setting and subject matter, but it doesnt make for terribly compelling viewing.
  Negative
As the drug causes society to degrade entirely over the course of a single weekend, Urge actually grows dull and numbing, just as it shouldbe reaching a gripping climax.
  Negative
Danny Masterson stars as Neil, an arrogant tech multimillionaire who flies by helicopter with a bunch of old friends to his modern mansion on an exclusive island.
  Negative
They are universally attractive and annoying, including Neals uptight assistantgirlfriend, Theresa  Ashley Greene' uninhibited artist Jason  Justin Chatwin' formerly chubby fitness freak Vick  Chris Geere' and Vicks slinky, nymphomaniac girlfriend, Denise  Bar Paly.
  Very negative
This weekend is going to be epic, Neal assures the reluctant Theresa.
  Negative
The word epic gets thrown around a lot in  Jerry Stahls script, but the movie itself rarely delivers on that promise.
  Neutral
Soon, theyre all gussied up for a night of debauchery at Volcano, a red-light club where a mysterious pair of giant, masked eyes on the outside of the building size people up and determine whether theyre worthy of entry.
  Negative
Inside the cavernous, ornate structure, strangers grind on the dance floor and a performance artist named Xiomara Kea Ho entertains the crowd in red-leather straps and Victorias Secret-style angel wings.
  Negative
Meanwhile, more strangers in fetish gear massage and seduce Neal and his pals in the VIP area.
  Negative
Its the kind of stuff that might have seemed titillating and shocking back when  Eyes Wide Shut came out back in .
  Negative
Now it just looks desperate and obvious.
  Negative
Soon, Jason is being led to a back room where the clubs owner a dapper, cackling  Pierce Brosnan, listed in the credits only as The Man offers a lot of philosophical babble before explaining exactly what the drug is that everyones taking at this place.
  Negative
Its called Urge, he says, and he claims it allows users to become a pure version of themselves.
  Positive
Jason is welcome to share it with his eager pals.
  Positive
But!
  Neutral
Theres a catch.
  Neutral
You can only do Urge once in your lifetime.
  Neutral
Strangely, this cobalt-blue inhalant does nothing for Jason.
  Negative
But all his friends have the time of their lives, letting go of their every inhibition which, naturally, prompts them to ignore the one-time-only warning and try to relive the magic the next night.
  Negative
But whereas round one was sexy, fun and freeing, round two makes them angry, paranoid and violent.
  Positive
And its not just Neil and his buddies.
  Negative
Its everyone on the entire island.
  Positive
The deterioration of society comes swiftly and it takes various forms, from one friend in the group Ashley Knapp cavorting on the kitchen counter with an entire cake to rough sex that goes wrong to party guests straight-up pummeling each other for laughs.
  Negative
All that brutality and promiscuity is surprisingly boring, though.
  Negative
These characters were already such awful people that they dont have that much farther to fall and the eventual epiphanies that at least some of them experience ring hollow as their sandy playground turns into a bloody wasteland.
  Negative
Its also hard to discern Kaufmans point.
  Negative
Is Urge a cautionary tale about what happens when you get what you want all the time?
  Neutral
Supporting characters who are workout fiends or Botox junkies meet their ends in spectacularly bloody fashion while trying to scrub away the things they hate about themselves which is unintentionally hilarious.
  Negative
Is Kaufman shining a light on the folly of our vanity?
  Neutral
Maybe hes making a statement on how malleable and insecure humans tend to be.
  Neutral
Brosnan is clearly a Satan figure with his deep tan and sleek dress, quoting Milton at a diner in the cold, hard light of day.
  Positive
He at least appears to be enjoying himself here in a rare chance to play a pure villain.
  Positive
That diner scene, by the way, is a prime example of the films artfulness with its noirish shafts of lights through the blinds.
  Negative
Its stylish even as it turns ugly.
  Positive
Maybe Kaufman is just trying to have his cake and roll around in it and eat it too.
  Neutral
