In photographs taken close to the time  Alain Resnais was to present his Life of Riley its French title is Aimer, boire, et chante, that is, Love, Drink, and Sing, but the English title matches that of its source, a work by British playwright Alan Ayckbourn at the  Berlin International Film Festival last February, the venerated director hardly looked like a man whod made his final movie.
  Negative
But Resnais went on to his final reward in June, which casts a retrospective shadow on the movie and places it in a context we cant be sure he intended.
  Negative
For Life of Riley is about a man who is dying, a man whos never seen on screen.
  Negative
Set, as Ayckburns play is, in the countryside of England, and enacted by characters who read British newspapers and drive in cars with right-hand-side steering wheels nevertheless speaking in French, Life of Riley features six characters not in search of an auteur but preoccupied with the impending death of an old pal, the title character.
  Negative
Rileys an old pal, more precisely, to two of the males in the cast, but something more to three of the females.
  Negative
Kathryn  Sabine Azema, Resnais real-life partner, the formidable, voluble wife of physician Colin  Hippolyte Girardot is a former girlfriend whod like to renew her closeness with Riley.
  Negative
Tamara  Caroline Sihol, cast as a romantic interest opposite Riley in an amateur theatrical production the play-within-a-play ia also an Ayckbourn work, in a typically meta touch, wants to take that relationship into the real world, in part to spite her philandering husband Jack Michel Vuillermoz.
  Negative
Rileys youngish ex-wife Monica  Sandrine Kiberlain is seen as torn between her compassion Rileys been given a sudden fatal diagnosis and her domestic bliss with a sternly jealous new husband Andr Dussolier.
  Negative
Its worth noting that the disparity between the characters and the actors playing them, age-wise is frequently pretty great, but thats just one aspect of the movie artifice, which is not unrelated to its origin as a theater work, andor the fact of that aforementioned play-within-a-play.
  Negative
Everything in Life of Riley, Resnais makes plain, is a contrivance.
  Negative
Much of the joy and beauty of the movie comes from letting the levels of contrivance fall into place, as with some Rube Goldberg contraption, creating a parallel abstract narrative to the more conventional semi-farcical one unfolding on screen.
  Positive
In the latter, the comedic tension mounts as Kathryns character becomes more manic and bossy Azemas performance is an energetic tour-de-force, and the forces imposing themselves on Rileys simultaneously dwindling and blossoming existence hes apparently the hit of the play, and undiminished in energy at a teens birthday party near the movies finale loom over him even as the unseen character plots a switcheroo that will leave all of the on-screen characters at least slightly aghast.
  Negative
As all this is going on, Resnais constructs a formal game that incorporates transitional location shots, hand-drawn cross-hatched pen-and-ink backdrops for close-ups shades of his s comic-strip movie, the daring but less successful  I Want To Go Home and clear stage-style sets for the action proper.
  Negative
At certain critical points near the end he cuts in shots of an animatronic mole or gopher snickering, in a homage tocan it beCaddyshack?
  Negative
Maybe.
  Neutral
I kind of think so.
  Positive
So theres no shortage of stimulating and maybe even confounding formal playfulness here.
  Negative
And its not there to leaven the subject matter' its integrally folded in, to suggest that matters of both life and death are best approached with a light touch.
  Negative
Its an encouraging perspective from a filmmaker whose work has never lacked for seriousness his first feature film was Hiroshima Mon Amour and whose late-career cosmic games are distinguished by a joy thats never glib see  Wild Grass.
  Positive
Still, for all of this, Life of Riley doesnt play like a deliberate or self-conscious last film, its suitably elegiac final images notwithstanding.
  Negative
It doesnt rage against the dying of the light because its creators imaginative light is burning bright throughout.
  Negative
The near-featherweight insouciance is part of the magic of Life of Riley: its sub-theme could be the bearable and perhaps necessary lightness of aging gracefully.
  Negative
What a way to go.
  Neutral
If you have to go, and we all do.
  Positive
