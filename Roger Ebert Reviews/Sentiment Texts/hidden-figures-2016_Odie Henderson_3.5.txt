Ive been a computer programmer for - years, so I suppose I would be a tad biased toward a film that uses FORTRAN as a means of exacting socially relevant revenge.
  Negative
In Hidden Figures, the FORTRAN punch cards coded by Dorothy Vaughan  Octavia Spencer prove that she is not only qualified to be the first employee supervisor of color in the space program, but that her girls as she calls them have the skills to code the IBM mainframe under her tutelage.
  Negative
Vaughans victory comes courtesy of the programming manual she had to lift from the segregated library that vengefully refused to loan it to her because it wasnt in the colored section.
  Negative
When her shocked daughter protests her unconventional borrowing methods, Vaughan tells her, I pay my taxes for this library just like everybody else!
  Negative
Vaughan is one of the three real-life African-American women who helped decipher and define the mathematics used during the space race in the s.Hidden Figures tells their stories with some of the years best writing, directing and acting.
  Positive
Co-writerdirector  Theodore Melfi adapting Margot Lee Shetterly's book with co-writer Allison Schroeder has a light touch not often found in dramas like this, which makes the material all the more effective.
  Negative
He knows when to let a visual cue or cut tell the story, building on moments of repetition before paying off with scenes of great power.
  Positive
For example, to depict the absurdity of segregated bathrooms, Melfi repeats shots of a nervously tapping foot, followed by mile-long runs to the only available bathroom.
  Negative
This running joke culminates in a brilliantly acted, angry speech by  Taraji P. Henson that is her finest cinematic moment to date.
  Positive
Henson plays Katherine Johnson, a mathematician who, in the films opening flashback, is shown to have a preternatural affinity for math in her youth.
  Negative
Her success at obtaining the education she needs is hindered by Jim Crow, but she still manages to earn degrees in math and a job at NASAs Colored Computer division.
  Negative
In an attempt to beat Russia to the moon, NASA has been looking for the nations best mathematicians.
  Negative
The importance of the space race forces them to accept qualified candidates of any stripe, including those society would normally discourage.
  Negative
We meet the adult version of Johnson as shes sitting in Vaughans stalled car with her NASA colleague  Mary Jackson  Janelle Monae.
  Negative
The dialogue between the three women establishes their easy rapport with one another, and introduces their personalities.
  Positive
Vaughan is no-nonsense, Jackson is a wise ass with impeccable comic timing and Johnson is the clever optimist.
  Very positive
They are similarly educated, though each has their own skill set the film will explore.
  Negative
Vaughans mechanical skills are highlighted first: Spencers legs jut out from underneath her broken down car as she applies the trade taught to her by her father.
  Negative
Her supervisory expertise is also on display when a police officer shows up to investigate.
  Negative
Though the cop situation is resolved in an amusing, joyous fashion, Hidden Figures never undercuts the fears and oppressions of this era.
  Negative
Theyre omnipresent even when we dont see them, and the film develops a particular rhythm between problems and solutions that is cathartic without feeling forced.
  Negative
At the request of Vaughans supervisor  Kirsten Dunst, Johnson is sent to a room full of White male mathematicians to assist in some literal rocket science.
  Negative
The calculations have stumped everyone, including Paul Stafford  Jim Parsons, the hotshot whose math Johnson is hired to check.
  Negative
Parsons is a bit of a weak link here his petulance, while believable, is overplayed to the point of cartoonish villainy but the overall attitude in the room made me shudder with bad memories of my own early career tribulations.
  Negative
Ive been the only person of color in a less than inviting work environment, and many of Hensons delicate acting choices vis--vis her body language held the eerie feeling of sense memory for me.
  Neutral
Though she remains confident in her work and presents that confidence whenever questioned, Henson manifests on her person every hit at her dignity.
  Positive
You can see her trying to hold herself in check instead of going full-Cookie Lyon on her colleagues.
  Neutral
In addition to the unwelcome men in the room, Johnson also has to deal with the tough, though fair complaints of her grizzled supervisor, Al Harrison  Kevin Costner.
  Negative
Costner is a perfect fit here' he should consider running out the rest of his career in supporting mentor roles.
  Positive
He and Henson play off each other with an equal sense of bemusement, and when the film gives him something noble to do, it hides the clich under the nostalgic sight of  Bull Durham's Crash Davis holding a baseball bat.
  Negative
While Johnson tries to keep  John Glenn charmingly played by  Glen Powell from exploding atop a rocket and Vaughan fights FORTRAN and Dunst for the right to be a supervisor, Janelle Monae is secretly walking off with the picture.
  Negative
Mary Jackson wants to be the first Black engineer at NASA, yet as with Vaughans library book, shes hindered by Jim Crow practices.
  Negative
Jackson takes her case to court, and the scene where Monae wordlessly reacts to the outcome is one of the years best.
  Positive
With this and  Moonlight, Monae has established herself as a fine actress able to handle both comedy and drama.
  Positive
The awards praise for Spencer is certainly justified, but Monae is the films true supporting player MVP.
  Positive
Watching Hidden Figures I thought about how I would have felt had I seen this movie  years ago, when I made the decision to study math and computer science.
  Negative
I might have felt more secure in that decision, and certainly would have had better ideas on how to handle some of the thorny racial situations into which I found myself.
  Negative
The strange thing for me is that I saw more Black programmers in this movie than Ive encountered in my entire career.
  Negative
I had few points of reference in this regard, and the I.T. world reflects that.
  Positive
Even today, some of my customers look at me funny when I show up to fix the problem.
  Positive
Hopefully, Hidden Figures will inspire women and people of color and hell, men too with its gentle assertion that theres nothing unusual nor odd about people besides White men being good at math.
  Negative
But my secret fantasy is that this feel-good film will be a huge hit at the box office.
  Very positive
Under its great acting, bouncy Pharrell score and message is a film thats as geeked out about math as a superhero film is about its comic book origins.
  Positive
So much so that it does my mathematicians heart proud.
  Positive
It deserves to make as much money as any planet in the Marvel Universe does.
  Negative
This is one of the year's best films.
  Very positive
