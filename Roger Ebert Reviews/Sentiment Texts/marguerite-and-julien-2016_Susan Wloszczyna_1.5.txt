Marguerite amp' Julien, a lushly photographed pastoral rendezvous propelled by forbidden love and directed by Frances  Valrie Donzelli, is definitely not typical fare.
  Negative
The script, spun from a th-century legal case involving incest between an upper-class brother and sister, was once intended to be filmed by  Francois Truffaut in the early s. And, occasionally, it exhibits a penchant for a certain New Wave playfulness, such as the irising effect that opens and closes several scenes and ensemble gatherings whose action is briefly frozen before bursting back to life seconds later.

I cut my teeth on cult cinema by attending multiple midnight viewings of  The Rocky Horror Picture Show, where butler Riff Raff and maid Magenta exhibited what seemed to be a strange sibling affinity for one another something to do with touching elbows so I kept an open mind.

But then we are treated to a bedtime gathering of enraptured school-girl moppets being told the story of these law-breaking paramours by a caretaker as if it were an innocent fairy tale instead of a recounting of a rather questionable situation.
  Negative
This framing device, which is revisited now and then, does little to enhance what eventually reveals itself to be nothing more than a ponderous platter of mal fromage, soapy unfulfilling imported cheese served on stale crackers.
  Negative
The wan narrative at hand fails on several levels, including an annoying amount of intentional anachronistic details that detract rather enhance.
  Very negative
Forgive me if I am wrong, but a romance propelled by verboten desire that refuses to be denied should be at the very least enthralling and perhaps sweep us off our feet.
  Negative
On the other hand, the presence of cars, helicopters, phonographs, prep-school sweaters and foosball tables in a film that concludes in  yet occasionally seems to take place in the s is jarring.
  Negative
Meanwhile, the servants are garbed in period-correct outfits befitting subjects in a Vermeer painting.

I guess this jumbled approach is meant to infuse a sense of timelessness into the plight of these crazy rich kids but instead draws attention away from them.

Rather than presenting something akin to the heady youthful cravings of  Leonardo DiCaprio and  Claire Danes as contemporary versions of Romeo and Juliet, the equally tragic Marguerite amp' Julien often feels more like a version of Richie and Margot in  Wes Andersons  The Royal Tenenbaums crossed with the pre-teen runaways from  Moonrise Kingdom, but minus the humor and insight.
  Negative
The central pair is first introduced as children clearly besotted with one another as they constantly caress each other with their eyes.

  Negative
Poor  Geraldine Chaplin as Marguerites disapproving mother-in-law is severely made up to look like a mime and mostly plays what appears to be games of mahjong.
  Negative
Secret letters are surreptitiously passed by intermediaries, brother and sister finally commit the deed, law enforcers are notified and it all goes downhill from there.
  Very negative
Donzelli, a cinematic darling in her native land, is clearly in over her head here.
  Positive
But I do admire her taste in obscure music.
  Negative
Instead of pondering an ending that left me cold as the credits rolled, I instead immediately checked the soundtrack list and Googled the girl group The Shangri-Las and their mesmerizing song Past, Present and Future, which employs lyrics of hope and regret spoken over Beethovens "Moonlight Sonata."

It will give you chills.
