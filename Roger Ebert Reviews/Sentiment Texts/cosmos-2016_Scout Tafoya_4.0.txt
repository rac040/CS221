Time will tell if  Andrzej uawski has pulled off the same benevolent magic trick as Ral Ruiz and left his fans one more movie after his passing.
  Negative
Stranger things have happened, and no one welcomed the strange like uawski.
  Negative
For now we have only "Cosmos," based loosely on a novel by  Witold Gombrowicz, a culmination of the rabble rouser's nearly - year career.
  Negative
As usual, it's almost too much cinema for its  minutes.
  Negative
Confined to a few locations and shaking with ecstasy, possibility and the torment of being alive, "Cosmos" is like absinthe distilled secretly in a prison cell.
  Negative
The world may be angry, confusing, loud and lopsided when drinking it, but when the bottle is empty all you'll want is more.
  Negative
Reality has never been this fun, even if it's frequently this random and hopeless.
  Negative
Better to take the oblong fantasy.
  Positive
Jonathan Genet, who has the haunting, gaunt electricity of  Pierre Clementi, plays Witold, a student trying to fervently type his masterpiece in every spare second he finds.
  Negative
He and his friend Fuchs  Johan Libreau have retreated to a bizarre country inn for a little peace and quiet only to find neither.
  Negative
The owner is Madame Woytis  Sabine Azma, whose font of shocking red hair is always a relief to see, who is prone to fits of absolute stillness whenever excitement gets the better of her, usually after a screaming fit or a bout of somnambulant wood chopping.
  Positive
The other occupants of the inn are Woytis' lover Lon Jean Franois Balmer, who salts his worts and jumbles his words, Catherette the maid  Clmentine Pons, whose cleft lip entrances all who gaze upon it, Woytis' gorgeous daughter Lena  Victria Guerra and her equally gorgeous paramour  Andy Gillet.
  Negative
At once everything is wrong.
  Negative
A bird hangs from a small noose in the garden outside the inn.
  Negative
Bugs crawl over every morsel of food.
  Negative
Every time Witold catches sight of Lena he looses his composure in the most percussive fashion possible.
  Negative
Fuchs disappears for short stretches of time and comes back with increasingly flamboyant signs of injury.
  Negative
No one gets along, but they can't get quit of each other.
  Negative
There seems to be something keeping them in each other's orbit.
  Positive
The confluence of symbols an axe, lips, hanged animals, a ladder seem to hint that these disparate figures must destroy some part of their connection to one another in order to escape the prison of their imperfections.
  Negative
Witold's existence becomes a merry-go-round and he can't decide if he wants off.
  Negative
A merry-go-round might be the best way to describe the experience of watching the whole of uawski's cinema.
  Positive
His camera certainly does plenty of spinning and twirling.
  Neutral
A merry-go-round operated by a cackling, drunken carny who thinks kids could stand the scare.
  Negative
So you go round and round and so much cinema gets into your eyes and open mouth you think you might throw up.
  Positive
Do you want to get off?
  Negative
This kind of exhilaration could never be recreated by a responsible entertainer.
  Negative
You're implicated in the madness as surely as he is.
  Neutral
He was born in Ukraine and spent his early life in Poland, barely escaping death at the hands of Nazis.
  Negative
Knowing firsthand what depths we can sink to, he dedicated himself to mixing high and low with ululating abandon.
  Negative
If his politics and blocking seem to evoke a railroad being constructed in front of an already moving train, it was ultimately an honest concentration of fears and exuberances born of the realization that his life was not a guarantee.
  Negative
And so uawski shouted everything on his mind, threw sex and violence at the screen with equal parts glee and revulsion, and rarely hid behind an edit.
  Negative
H e wanted the camera to run every step and keep pace with his characters.
  Neutral
When he does edit to move significantly through time or space, it's to shock you, as in his favourite rug-pulling technique, dropping the score out of a scene without warning.
  Negative
Ugliness must be paid attention to, even celebrated, as it gallops into and trots upon our lives.
  Negative
Sometimes it's all we have, and we must have something.
  Positive
As one of the fatuous aristocrats in his  film "The Blue Note" says: "What is beautiful does not last."
  Positive
Trauma lasts forever.
  Neutral
"Cosmos" is both typical and atypical uawski.
  Negative
It's laugh-out-loud funny right up to its final seconds, new territory for the haunted auteur.
  Positive
The cast has delicious comedic chemistry and the movie ends with the funniest closing text I've ever read followed by a gag reel.
  Very positive
In Azma's Madame Woytis we have the everpresent overbearing mother figure familiar from his films "L'Amour Braque," "The Blue Note," "La Femme Publique" and "Szamanka" who seems to enjoy tormenting her offspring, though this time with more demented personality thanks to the moptopped queen of French cinema's fervor.
  Negative
It's sex-obsessed but it's romantic in its perverted longing, instead of just desperate.
  Negative
Witold has a poetic conception of the woman for whom he pines, and one gets the sense that he fears an Icarustype immolation should he ever get too close.
  Positive
When he first shakes Lena's hand, it looks like he's suddenly begun masturbating in front of her thanks to camera placement and his cowed, fidgeting body language.
  Negative
He can't ever act as though he's meant to have a place among his fellow homosapiens, but that doesn't keep him from throwing himself into crowds of them.
  Negative
That's the paradox at the heart of uawski's cinema.
  Positive
Those who do understand the bottomless grotesquery of humanity are addicted to the good parts that lay beyond.
  Neutral
Witold is plainly driven mad every second he remains in the company of Lena and her familiars, but he can't break away.
  Negative
He wants her, or the idea of her, badly enough to let himself be mentally hobbled by the impossibility of their union.
  Negative
His paranoia at the events transpiring all around the house grows and grows and soon comes to hallucinatory life.
  Positive
A look at a Tintin comic in the inn manifests into a man dressed as the famous boy detective during the final act.
  Positive
Long conversations about fixing Catherette's lip precede the introduction of a woman played by the same actress whose perfect mouth conceals deep emotional scars.
  Negative
A final destructive act may be something Witold dreams, compells or performs.
  Negative
Lena herself, who seems so detached and vibrant when Witold first encounters her, sinks into his quivering uncertainty the more time she spends at the receiving end of his affections.
  Very negative
She undergoes transformation while Witold lusts after her essence and writes soul describing passages about her in his book.
  Neutral
The women in earlier work by the Polish conjurer tended to blend together, thanks in part to his continuous casting of lovermuse  Sophie Marceau and because he relied so heavily on doppelgngers as narrative devices.
  Negative
But here the women are much more clearly delineated.
  Negative
Guerra last seen in "Lines of Wellington," Ral Ruiz's first film after his death is the most memorable because she slowly becomes Witold and, by extension, uawski himself, prone to unexpected mood swings and bouts of open mouthed quaking at the unruly design of fate.
  Negative
What does Lena see when she stands shivering, cigarette stuck aloft, staring into the sky?
  Negative
Us, sitting there, watching her.
  Neutral
The same mad bunch of contradictory insects that uawski saw whenever he pointed his camera at anyone: the boundless, endless possibility of it all, the horror and the wonder.
  Negative
The joy of wordplay, the ache of love, the terror of fascism, the pangs of envy.
  Positive
He saw all of us, everything we wanted to hide, and his cinema is an explosion of all those dirty, secret things.
  Positive
"Cosmos" is everything at once too fast, like the broken merry-go-round, sudden inebriation, or a magic trick.
  Negative
Real life is only steps away, but you'll never find anything as brutally fantastic out there.
  Negative
