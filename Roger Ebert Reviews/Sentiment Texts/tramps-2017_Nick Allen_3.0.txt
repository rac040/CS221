Tramps director  Adam Leon once said something in an interview that I will never forget.
  Negative
While talking about his gritty debut film  Gimme the Loot, about two young graffiti writers wanting to tag a New York City landmark, Leon said that his goal was making someones favorite movie of the year.
  Positive
Thats quite a novel idea that only interesting filmmakers could accomplish to make something that speaks to a viewer so directly, it essentially fulfills what they need, what they've been yearning to see.
  Negative
And it proves a fitting statement coming from Leon, given that hes made a direct companion piece to Gimme the Loot with Tramps, which has a similar urban verve, style and even more sweetness.
  Positive
But while Tramps may be inspired and unusual, its hard to shake off the idea that Leon isn't just making the film he wants to see, he's riffing on himself.
  Negative
Like Gimme the Loot, Tramps concerns two young people in New York City, getting into an odyssey well over their heads and placing themselves into some mischief.
  Positive
This time its  Callum Turners Danny and  Grace Van Pattens Elle, as their meet-cute is a simple, profitable and possible crime.
  Negative
Pick up a suitcase, make an exchange, get paid later.
  Negative
Danny is doing it to help out his recently incarcerated brother, and we soon find out that Elle is doing it to start her unsatisfactory life anew.
  Negative
As strangers to one another, neither know what is in the suitcase.
  Negative
Still, the stakes of a payday causes enough nervous energy for the both of them, especially when Danny leaves the bag at the wrong spot, and the wrong person takes it.
  Negative
Despite that mystery, this movie is more about mischief than danger.
  Negative
It gets a lot of mileage out of what could be in that suitcase, but since comedian  Mike Birbiglia is cast in the movie to more or less play his persona, whilst wearing baggy khaki shorts, you get pretty comfortable that the bag probably doesnt contain anything like Marcellus Wallace's soul or even a murder weapon.
  Negative
Like how Gimme the Loot had one member of its graffiti-tagging duo walk around the city in socks, Tramps prefers innocence.
  Negative
Credit goes to the nifty script by Leon who co-wrote the story with  Jamund Washington, which keeps the story active with jolts of stressful bad luck or completely surprising good luck, all while adhering to the logic the story has set for itself.
  Positive
Throughout their journey, as they search for the rural woman who might have their bag while realizing they might maybe kind of like each other, neither Danny or Elle have anything intriguing to say, but they are fun as a pair.
  Positive
And its warming to see them enter into the boonies as a type of new reality, where they role-play relationship life by breaking into a fancy home and bike away wearing the owners clothes.
  Negative
Still, its Tramps attitude to be short and sweet that proves definitive, vital.
  Positive
Tramps has a  La La Land-level nostalgia for the filmmaking of numerous gritty NYC movies from the 's, and achieves a similar effect, where it comes off as old-school with a level of charm wholly reliant on individual taste.
  Positive
When recreating New Yorks bustling and behemoth qualities, Leon uses slow zooms onto two actors who are hundreds of feet away, while their dialogue is captured as if we were eavesdropping on them.
  Negative
This is the kind of film that seems excited about unintentional extras in the background glaring into the camera, whereas productions of similar size but previous eras and lesser filmmaking technology took that fourth-wall breaking as a budgetary sacrifice.
  Negative
Tramps specifically yearns for a scrappy and practical look butedges on tacky vintage, especially as its narrative becomes one splash of water away from losing its grit or one wrong music cue from being too twee.
  Negative
Also like La La Land, Tramps is a time capsule narrative experiment, in service of a romance that is equally sweet and stubbornly old fashioned.
  Positive
For example, Danny and Elle have fluffy banter at a carnival, while a gorgeous big band-like tune plays in the background.
  Positive
Framed like a dream away from their urban realities, it works.
  Positive
And yet later on, Danny insists to Elle, I dont want the girls in my building, as if Tramps was taking place in a century where people only met and fell in love with those in their neighborhood.
  Negative
All of this whimsy seems to be part of Leons goal, especially as he wraps them tighter and tighter together using an admirably constructed tone, but its just not that interesting of a goal.
  Positive
It is cute, though.
