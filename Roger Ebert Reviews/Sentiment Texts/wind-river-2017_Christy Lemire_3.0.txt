Taylor Sheridans films take place in a mythical version of the American West that doesnt exist anymore, if it ever really did.
  Negative
Its a place where there are no rules beyond the ones people invent for themselves to survive stretches of Texas and New Mexico that are equal parts brutal and beautiful.
  Positive
Sheridan previously explored this terrain as the writer of  Denis Villeneuves  Sicario and  David Mackenzies  Hell or High Water, the latter of which earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay.
  Negative
Now, hes directing for only the second time as well as writing with Wind River, which feels very much of a piece with those two previous films, even as it distinguishes itself with a vivid sense of place.
  Positive
Wind River is full of vast, scrubby expanses that give way to pristine blankets of white, interrupted only by a snowmobile slashing a solitary path.
  Negative
You can hear the crunch of snow and feel the bitter chill, which runs so deep that it can be deadly.
  Negative
Sheridan drops us in and we know this place immediately' his storytelling is meaty but efficient, and his pacing moves along at a steadily engrossing clip before ultimately exploding in a startling blast of violence.
  Negative
A moody procedural, Wind River is heavy with symbolism from the start perhaps, too much so.
  Negative
When we first see  Jeremy Renners Cory Lambert, a tracker well-versed in the Wyoming wilds, hes lying on his belly in the snow, camouflaged with his rifle, picking off wolves that have been preying on sheep.
  Negative
Hes a protector because its his job, but as we learn throughout the course of the film, that calling has become deeply personal.
  Negative
Theres specificity to the way the characters talk, a poetry that can be quite moving or it can clang on the ear.
  Positive
But Sheridans script can be just as powerful in its quiet moments like these in what the characters dont say to each other.
  Positive
On one of Corys hunting expeditions, he comes across the frozen body of a young woman' wed seen her at the films start, frantically running barefoot in the middle of the night under a crisp, full moon.
  Positive
He recognizes her as Natalie  Kelsey Asbille, the best friend of his teenage daughter, who also died mysteriously a few years earlier.
  Negative
Since the death occurred on the Wind River reservation and Natalie, like Corys daughter, was Native American the tribal police get involved in the investigation, led by the great  Graham Greene as the dryly humorous, no-nonsense chief.
  Neutral
But so, too, do the feds, in the form of newbie FBI agent Jane Banner  Elizabeth Olsen.
  Negative
Shes been sent from the Las Vegas office and is so ill-equipped for this place and this weather that she has to borrow snow gear from the closet of Corys late daughter, which adds to the prevailing sense of grief.
  Negative
This isnt the land of backup, Jane, he says to her in explaining life on the reservation.
  Negative
This is the land of: Youre on your own.
  Neutral
And so as Cory works with Jane to unravel the mystery of what happened to Natalie in this remote, secretive land, he also must finally face what happened to his own child.
  Positive
Cinematographer  Ben Richardson, whose work includes the ravishing and dreamlike  Beasts of the Southern Wild, helped create the richly atmospheric visuals.
  Very positive
Sheridan handles the relationship between Jane and Cory deftly: Theyre equals, but they also need and learn from each other.
  Negative
And while fellow Avengers Renner and Olsen have a natural, understated chemistry, Sheridan mercifully doesnt throw their characters together in an awkward, needless romance.
  Negative
Renner also has several powerful scenes with  Gil Birmingham who played a crucial supporting role in Hell or High Water as Natalies grieving father, Martin.
  Positive
Hes all masculine stoicism and bitter swagger until he isnt, and watching his proud veneer crumble is shattering.
  Negative
At times, Sheridan has his characters spell out a little too clearly what theyre thinking and feeling, and thats often the case in the exchanges between Cory and Martin.
  Negative
But the words are so beautiful and come from such a place of deep truth, its hard not to be moved, and they help give Wind River a simultaneous sense of timelessness and immediacy.
  Very positive
