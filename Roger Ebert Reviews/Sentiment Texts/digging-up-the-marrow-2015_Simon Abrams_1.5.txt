At one point in "Digging up the Marrow," a straight-faced mockumentary about a man who discovers another man who claims to have seen real-life monsters, filmmaker  Adam Green "Hatchet," " Frozen" compares his film-within-the-film to a "found footage film."
  Negative
Kane Hodder, the horror icon and man listening to Green's explanation, bristles: "Found footage, huh?
  Negative
Like that hasn't been done before."
  Negative
That exasperated, knowing wink to viewers is a throw-away gag, but it also says more about Green's ambitions or lack thereof than he realizes.
  Very negative
"Digging Up the Marrow" is a decent idea, but beyond some fun creature effects, and a surprisingly grounded performance from character actor  Ray Wise, the film just sits there.
  Positive
Green, who plays a snotty version of himself, doesn't follow through on any of the ideas that make his film stand out.
  Negative
As a result, "Digging Up the Marrow" just uselessly lies there, like a cat during a heat wave.
  Negative
"Digging Up the Marrow" begins with an ambitious, but ultimately pointless preface.
  Negative
Real-life horror convention guests, like "Toxic Avenger" director  Lloyd Kaufman and " Candyman" star  Tony Todd, tell Green about their first experiences with horror films, and why they're drawn to the genre.
  Negative
Other convention attendees then admit that they either believe or want to believe in monsters since many of them sympathize with monsters.
  Negative
After this, Green introduces himself by complaining about having to hype himself up "I already sound like a douchebag", and ragging on horror fans to his cameraman.
  Negative
Then Green stops clearing his throat, and gets to his film's subject: out of all of Green's fan mail, the most exciting correspondence he's received came from William Decker Wise, an eccentricretired Boston police officer who claims to have seen real monsters.
  Positive
Green then wastes a lot of time establishing Decker as an unreliable character.
  Negative
Decker tells us his story in his own time: he's a loner, divorced, highly imaginative, and also happens to have discovered a portal to a secret world of creatures.
  Positive
We sit and listen and wait for more enlivening details to come because, well, Green is at his mercy, and so are we.
  Negative
This wait-and-see strategy allows Green to back-load his special effects budget into his film's too-little-too-late conclusion, which goes pretty much exactly where you'd expect it to.
  Positive
Until then, "Digging Up the Marrow" is a lot of frantic "Did we see somethingcan we see something" conversations between Green and Decker.
  Negative
Half of these conversations are interesting because half are carried by Wise's weirdly measured performance.
  Positive
Wise is probably most well-known for losing his cool in "Twin Peaks," a slew of decent B-movies, and a ton of unbearable SyFy Channel movies.
  Negative
But here, he acts like someone you probably know, maybe your grandpa, or that sketchy guy you see on the subway every morning.
  Negative
He talks to Green as if he's pre-planned his end of their conversation, and simply will not abide any interruptions, not now, nuh uh.
  Negative
In true old man fashion, Deck knows what he knows, and that's all that he knows.
  Positive
Wise perfectly conveys that non-philosophy every time he flails his arms in response to Green's constant questioning.
  Neutral
This brings us to Green, the weaker half of the film's central conversations.
  Positive
Green's got an annoying habit of making his character more annoying than they need to be.
  Negative
This was true of the pampered protagonists of his earlier films, especially "Hatchet" and "Frozen," but there's no good reason for Green to be a self-involved jerk in "Digging Up the Marrow."
  Negative
Green takes Decker for granted, and then repeatedly tries to exploit him, making Green a soft target for viewers' disdain.
  Negative
Unfortunately, Green's not supposed to be completely unsympathetic.
  Very negative
Rather than commit to the idea that he's the film's real monster, he positions himself as a queasy mix of palatable audience surrogate and boorish human dartboard.
  Very negative
There's not a lot to like about Green as character, but he's in almost every one of his film's scenes, making it impossible to enjoy "Digging Up the Marrow" without enjoying his company.
  Negative
Green's creative laziness also extends to his film's best idea: Green recognizes himself in Decker's quixotic obsession with monsters.
  Positive
This theme doesn't really get developed.
  Negative
Instead, we get a lot of scenes where Green hangs out with Ray Wise in a dark, wooded cemetery.
  Negative
At first, you can't see much, and eventually, you don't really want to given how drawn-out many of Green's scare scenes are.
  Negative
Worse still, the film's monster-bait sequences all boil down to: "What was that?
  Negative
I don't know!
  Neutral
But it might have been something?
  Neutral
Oh no, look out!"
  Negative
There are some effective jump scares in "Digging Up the Marrow," but none are worth writing home about.
  Negative
Wise is easily the best thing about Green's film since he doesn't require any set-up, or pay-off to be immediately unsettling.
  Positive
Here's hoping Green's next film is just  minutes of Ray Wise talking to an imaginary friend.
  Negative
