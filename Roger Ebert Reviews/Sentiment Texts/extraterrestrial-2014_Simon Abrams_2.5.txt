It's frustrating to watch a horror movie as promising as  "Extraterrestrial," a new slasher film about alien abduction,  fail to  hit its marks.
  Negative
The first half of "Extraterrestrial" is a stew of generic  influences, particularly " Signs" and Steven Spielberg's "War of the  Worlds."
  Negative
But the film picks up considerably once its drama becomes as  urgent as its David-Fincher-on-acid primary color palette.
  Negative
At that  point, writerdirector team  Colin Minihan and  Stuart Ortiz aka: the  Vicious brothers finally distinguish themselves by visualizing how  their abductees feel when they're taken.
  Negative
Minihan and Ortiz memorably  torment their protagonists with a laundry list of afflictions,  especially panic attacks, separation anxiety and a freakish amount of  stomach-centric violence.
  Negative
But while these expressionistic scenes are  viscerally impressive, "Extraterrestrial" never settles into a groove,  and therefore never becomes more than a collection of effectively icky  scenes.
  Negative
Before moderately-tall grey men descend  on the film's protagonists, "Extraterrestrial" only comes to life when  character actors  Gil Bellows and Michael  Ironside are on-screen.
  Negative
The rest of the film's cast a pack of horny  young things vacationing at a cabin in the woods don't fare nearly as  well.
  Negative
Like most other slasher film protagonists, these thrill-seeking  characters are only as captivating as the actors that play them since  all they do is get high, hook up, and fight amongst themselves.
  Negative
Thankfully, "Extraterrestrial" perks up whenever tough-but-fair Sheriff  Murphy Bellows warns the group to stay out of trouble, and  weed-growing alien conspiracy theorist Travis Ironside babbles about "staying off the grid" to avoid the government's notice.
  Negative
These  characters aren't inherently interesting but Bellows and Ironside's  thoughtful performances make them worth watching.
  Positive
Unfortunately,  Minihan and Ortiz switch up the tone of their film so frequently that  it's impossible to take characters seriously beyond a scene-for-scene  basis.
  Negative
For example, the scene where sensitive young thing Kyle Freddie  Stroma proposes marriage to girlfriend April  Brittany Allen, and she  turns him down, is overshadowed by a sleazy introductory close-up of  Allen's backside.
  Negative
Minihan and Ortiz just don't  seem to care about their characters beyond the sensations they can be  used to elicit.
  Negative
So it's not especially surprising when one protagonist  is probed by aliens in a gratuitous, " Evil Dead"-esque rape scene.
  Negative
It's a  vile sequence, especially since it only lasts long enough to shock you.
  Negative
Moreover, the identity of the character being tortured is immaterial,  revealing just how interchangeable the film's characters are.
  Negative
Thankfully,  once aliens take finally over "Extraterrestrial," scare scenes take  precedence over character-driven drama.
  Negative
Scenes where aliens slink behind  a peep hole, disappear beneath a pool of water and re-appear just  out-of-view are exceptional, though not because they're especially  imaginative, or well-choreographed.
  Negative
After all, the aliens in question  aren't much to sneeze at: they're grey, bug-eyed creatures from beyond,  the kind you've seen in a million other movies.
  Negative
Thankfully, Murphy and  Travis's respective alien encounters are similarly derivative, but alive  with wild energy.
  Positive
They're ruthlessly effective inasmuch as they make  intense emotional, and physical stress look spectacular.
  Positive
This is thanks  in no small part to cinematographer Samy Inayeh's stellar contributions,  particularly the ostentatiously beguiling Spirograph-like patterns he  makes using lens flairs.
  Negative
Unfortunately,  once "Extraterrestrial" finally delivers its most emotionally draining  scene, it keeps right on going.
  Negative
Thankfully, these are some of the film's  most visually impressive sequences.
  Positive
But by this point, Minihan and  Ortiz's lack of discipline, and frequent cribbing from just about  everything, including " The Matrix" and " Alien," has worn away a lot of  good will.
  Negative
There's a lot to like about "Extraterrestrial," but not  enough to leave you completely satisfied.
