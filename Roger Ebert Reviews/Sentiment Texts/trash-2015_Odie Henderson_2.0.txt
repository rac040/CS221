Director  Stephen Daldry is some kind of Oscar Whisperer.
  Positive
His first three features, Billy Elliott,  The Hours and  The Reader earned him Best Director nominations, and three of his last four films were Best Picture nominees.
  Negative
Six of his actors have been up for Hollywoods golden boy, with the two worst nominees taking home Best Actress.
  Negative
Daldry specializes in prestige pictures, usually adapted from some best-selling novel and tarted up with all manner of tics and tricks designed to feign enormous levels of importance.
  Positive
Academy voters eat them up, so this is a case of hating the game and not the player.
  Negative
You can knock the movies, but you cant knock the hustle.
  Neutral
Daldrys latest,  Trash, co-directed with Christian Duurvoort, not only pitches the same Academy woo, it shamelessly mimics Best Picture winner  Slumdog Millionaire.
  Negative
Based on a young adult novel by  Andy Mulligan, Trash follows three teenaged Brazilian boys as they navigate a system of corruption out to destroy them.
  Negative
Theres millions of reals Brazilian dollars at stake, rap music blasting on the soundtrack, quick edits designed for maximum visual sexiness, minimal agency for our heroes, and vile graphic violence that serves only to titillate.
  Negative
Its all wrapped up in a video-based narrative structure that cant decide whether its cutesy or traumatizing, and cinematography that has the color palette of succotash.
  Negative
And yet, this is Daldrys most watchable movie since Billy Elliott."
  Positive
Its exploitative at times, but nowhere near as repulsive as The Reader or as cringe-inducing as Extremely Loud amp' Incredibly Close.
  Negative
"And unlike The Hours, Trash kept me awake for all  minutes of its runtime.
  Negative
There were moments when I was truly entertained, but more often than not, I wanted to know more about the daily lives of these kids.
  Neutral
Their existence, and the poverty they inhabit, is used as mere window dressing.
  Negative
Even the corrupt politicians fraudulent actions become a MacGuffin of sorts, and its the catalyst for the entire plot.
  Negative
Screenwriter  Richard Curtis  Love Actually gives his trio of protagonists moments to shine or play the hero in their action-filled story, but hes far too concerned with skimming the surface of the plots mechanics.
  Negative
As good as the three teenaged leads are and theyre quite good Trash treats them like video game avatars.
  Positive
They are chased for much of the film by a corrupt cop who is like a human version of "The Terminator."
  Negative
That nameless cop  Selton Mello is looking for a wallet owned by Jose Angelo  Wagner Moura.
  Negative
Angelo was the right-hand man for Santos, whose mayoral campaign is filled with pay-outs designed to ensure his election.
  Negative
Angelo has the incriminating goods on Santos, which he steals along with garbage bags full of cash.
  Negative
Angelos wallet contains the key to exposing Santos, so when surrounded by cops, Angelo tosses it into the garbage dump below his apartment.
  Negative
In flashes of violence, we learn Jose Angelo gets tortured and killed.
  Negative
Meanwhile, back at the dump, -year-old Raphael  Rickson Tevez earns a few reals by sifting through trash.
  Negative
He finds Angelos wallet and splits the money inside with his friend Gardo  Eduardo Luis.
  Negative
But before they can dispose of the seemingly useless other contents in the wallet, Officer Mello offers a reward if anyone finds the wallet.
  Negative
Immediately suspicious, Raphael and Gardo set out to discover why the contents are so important.
  Negative
Angelos personal effects include pictures of a little girl, cryptic numbers written on the back of a photo strip and a locker key.
  Negative
To find a safe place to hide the wallet, Gardo and Raphael visit Rato Gabriel Weinstein.
  Negative
Rato lives in the sewer.
  Neutral
Im a sewer kid, he says on the video playback Trash uses as narration.
  Negative
Rato recognizes the locker key and the trio embark on an adventure that will take them to jail, to the beautiful beaches of Brazil and to the precipice of death.
  Negative
Occasionally, theyll be assisted by characters played by  Martin Sheen and  Rooney Mara, both wasted as Catholic Church workers who help the locals.
  Negative
Like most of Daldrys own work, Trash suffers from a tonal problem.
  Negative
It reveals itself in the films most brutally offensive scene, which exists solely for shock value.
  Negative
Officer Mello kidnaps Raphael and takes him on a hard ride in the back of his police car.
  Negative
As classical music plays and the edits fly fast and furiously, Raphaels face and head are smashed against the police cars metal bars.
  Negative
When that doesnt get him to talk, Raphael is then thrown into the trunk of the police car and driven around again.
  Negative
The result turns his head into a bloody pulp.
  Negative
In a much grittier, more honest look at police corruption and abuse of the poor, this scene would have had merit.
  Negative
But Trash doesnt earn this violence, so it comes off as a cynical, callous request for the audiences bloodlust rather than a harrowing investigation of a serious problem.
  Negative
While the caper plot has its moments, I kept hoping Trash would do more than treat its setting as some curiously unexplainable foreign planet.
  Negative
Trash is almost saved by the beautiful camaraderie between Weinstein, Luis and Tevez.
  Negative
They rib each other as -year-olds do, but theyre also protective and loving toward one another.
  Neutral
Each of them relies on, and respects, what the others bring to the table, both in the action-filled moments and the quiet ones.I liked their performances a lot.
  Positive
You want them to succeed and survive.
  Neutral
You also want their characters to be in a better movie, one that gives them the fleshing-out they deserve.
  Negative
