"The Outsider" is a subpar version of " The Limey" starring a subpar version of  Terence Stamp.
  Negative
Actually, beefy, six-foot-three Brit  Craig Fairbrass feels more like a subpar version of  Jason Statham, given how generically ludicrous this B-movie's plotting and action are.
  Negative
But the premise will sound familiar.
  Neutral
Fairbrass plays the swaggeringly named Lex Walker, a British army veteran who's now working as a private contractor for a firm in Afghanistan.
  Negative
When he learns that his estranged daughter, Samantha, has turned up dead under mysterious circumstances in Los Angeles, he immediately blows off his responsibilities and flies out to identify her body.
  Negative
But when he pulls back the sheet at the morgue, he realizes that the twentysomething blond woman lying cold and still before him is not his daughter after all, but a stranger.
  Negative
The rest of "The Outsider" consists of the vexed Lex trolling various bars and bad guys' hangouts, making threats in his thick, Cockney accent.
  Negative
Fairbrass' resume includes voice work on several versions of the "Call of Duty" video game, but that doesn't make him any more convincing here.
  Negative
The tinny, echoey audio in this low-budget affair doesn't do him any favors, either.
  Negative
Lex busts skulls for information about his daughter's whereabouts and even fires off some impeccably placed rounds when necessary, but never suffers a scratch himself.
  Negative
Despite never having been to Los Angeles, he navigates the sprawling city with astounding efficiency and quickly figures out which receptionists to cajole, which bartenders to hassle.
  Negative
His ultimate target is Samantha's former boss, cyber millionaire Karl Schuster  James Caan, slumming, who offers polite concern and pretends he couldn't possibly have known who Samantha was among the hundreds of people he employs at the laughably named Most Industries.
  Very negative
He's slick, but his thick New York accent betrays him and suggests he's lived a hard, messy life that, and the fact that he's willing to shoot incompetent underlings dead in his office without blinking an eye.
  Negative
Lex gets help infiltrating Schuster's tacky, heavily guarded Beverly Hills lair from a surly, money-hungry waitress  Shannon Elizabeth, wearing a tight dress and a scowl.
  Negative
She pretends to be a high-priced escort to distract Schuster so Lex can sneak in and steal the secret data revealing a worldwide identity-theft ring and, oh, never mind.
  Negative
It's all so dully far-fetched, does it really matter?
  Negative
It is sadly telling, though, that the primary female characters in "The Outsider" are a woman pretending to be a prostitute and a woman who may or may not be dead.
  Negative
The police detective conducting his own parallel and legally sanctioned investigation of what happened to Samantha and her deceased doppelganger lets Lex's vigilante body count rise.
  Negative
Because really, what else is he going to do?
  Neutral
The cop is played by  Jason Patric, sporting the bored look of a customer waiting for the bank to open so he can cash his paycheck.
  Negative
Patric's character refers to Lex as "the limey" at one point, as if this movie's echoes of Steven Soderbergh's  thriller weren't already obvious.Director Brian A. Miller, who co-wrote the script with Fairbrass, clearly was trying to make that sort of modern-day film noir, the kind that lurks in the seedy underbelly of L.A. His interiors are full of smoky light streaming through half-closed blinds, and his many, many aerial shots of the city aim to depict it as a vast, glittering wasteland.
  Negative
His geography is distractingly mangled if you know how the freeway system here works, but that's the least of the film's problems.
  Negative
Fairbrass could be a viable and even enjoyable B-action hero if given the right material.
  Positive
He's got a striking, muscular presence and he seems to understand the innate guilty-pleasure ridiculousness of the genre.
  Positive
Until then, he'll have to remain an outsider himself.
  Negative
