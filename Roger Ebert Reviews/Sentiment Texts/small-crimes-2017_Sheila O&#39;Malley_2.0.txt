The world of "Small Crimes," directed by E.L. Katz, is grubby and corrupt.
  Negative
The characters are brutish and morally compromised beyond repair.
  Negative
Taking place in a small Midwestern town, the atmosphere is an airless bell jar.
  Negative
Into that world steps Joe  Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, a former dirty cop, released from a six-year stint in prison, staying with his parents and trying half-heartedly to rebuild his life.
  Negative
"Small Crimes," an adaptation by Katz and  Macon Blair of the novel by  David Zeltserman, is a genre film hampered in a muddy underwater mood, and while there are some startling twists and turns, it never quite lifts itself out of its malaise.
  Negative
This is not helped by the way the script handles exposition by avoiding it almost entirely.
  Negative
Names from the past proliferate: Billy, Phil, Junior ... and it's hard to keep them straight, it's hard to figure out what actually happened, who did what to whom.
  Very negative
Joe may be a handsome strapping guy who looks like a movie star, but he emanates Loser.
  Neutral
He's a guy with no substance and a semi-flat-affect, a guy drawn to the quick fix.
  Negative
He caves to corruption easily.
  Negative
He got sober in prison, and flashes his sobriety chip around looking for congratulations, but visits a bar within days of release, downing a shot, and getting drawn into a possible hookup by a beautiful young woman who comes onto him hard.
  Positive
Joe has two daughters whom he hasn't seen in years, and their mother has denied him custody rights who can blame her?
  Negative
.
  Neutral
His parents  Robert Forster and  Jacki Weaver have already had it with their son, they both gave up on him a long time ago.
  Positive
Forster is particularly wonderful here, his sad-dog face looking at his son's "damage and mayhem," as he calls it, with baffled hurt eyes.
  Positive
He informs Joe that he recently read a book called "Understanding the Narcissistic Personality Disorder," in an attempt to comprehend his son's inability to live a meaningful life.
  Negative
It's strangely touching and sad.
  Positive
The criminal element in the town is a seething den of snakes, with old colleagues and cronies rising up to collect debts from Joe the instant he is released from prison.
  Negative
Pat Healy plays a full-on psychopath, out to get Joe.
  Negative
Gary Cole plays a police lieutenant who offers Joe an irresistible "carrot": kill someone who needs to be killed and get a revised custody agreement.
  Negative
Nobody plays amoral like Cole.
  Negative
There's a beautifully shot nighttime scene where the two characters sit in the bleachers at a football field, drinking beer, and Cole, staring out at the field, says with sincere regret, "Goddamn, I miss high school."
  Negative
That one line, pathetic and revealing, could describe the interior life of almost everyone in the film.
  Very negative
Whatever potential they may have all had vanished a long long time ago.
  Neutral
Everything is in the rearview mirror.
  Neutral
The genre elements in "Small Crimes" are very strong: the dark country roads, the sense of evil lurking in the shadows, threatening to engulf innocence.
  Neutral
Joe always hoping for the best in a shallow and delusional way ignores all the signs.
  Negative
He cannot recognize a Bad Idea.
  Negative
Even his involvement with a hospice nurse  Molly Parker is suspicious.
  Negative
He is into her, but he also seems to be using her to get to his "mark."
  Neutral
Nobody is "clean" though.
  Positive
The way Parker's character talks about being redeemed from past actions, of giving people a second chance, is intriguing.
  Very positive
What is she hiding?
  Neutral
What are her ghosts?
  Neutral
Macon Blair co-writer of this and " Blue Ruin," a sensational film which won the Directors' Fortnight at Cannes, and director of the Sundance-winning " I Don't Feel at Home in This World Anymore" shows up in a small role, as do many other fine actors.
  Positive
The characters don't inhabit anything resembling a real world, they inhabit the plot of the film, playing out their small parts in the potential blood bath gathering on the outskirts of town.
  Negative
"Small Crimes" works in part but is strangely murky in others.
  Negative
There's a lot of dead air.
  Negative
It's the pettiness, the small-ness of the characters that makes the greatest impression.
  Positive
