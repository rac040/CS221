Ryan Reynolds is having a bit of a moment, even if too few people are seeing it.
  Positive
Taken together, his work in  Atom Egoyans  The Captive, Anna Boden amp'  Ryan Flecks Sundance hit Mississippi Grind and, releasing On Demand and in limited theatrical release today,  Marjane Satrapis The Voices, represent a renaissance for the actor, who is clearly taking roles that interest him instead of the biggest paychecks or most likely shots at stardom.
  Negative
Ive always liked Reynolds for the most part, but he does his best work yet here in Satrapis odd, pitch-black comedy about a man who talks to his dog and cat.
  Positive
And they talk back.
  Positive
The opening act of The Voices has echoes of Joel and Ethan Coens sarcastic looks at small town life as we meet the relentlessly upbeat Jerry Reynolds, a worker at a toy factory at which he must dress in pink every day.
  Negative
Hes as happy as they come, gleefully planning an office party and over the moon at the fact that it will include a conga line to "Sing a Happy Song" like a cheesy wedding.
  Negative
Its only when he returns to his rundown abode that his cat Mr. Whiskers sets him straight The only reason they dont fire your ass is because youre so hopelessly pathetic you amuse them.
  Negative
Like so many filmmakers before her, Satrapi is exploring the dark underbelly and murderous intent of even the most cheerful, seemingly happy people in society.
  Negative
Jerry needs to be on drugs to function normally.
  Neutral
So says Dr. Warren an underutilized  Jacki Weaver, with whom he regularly meets.
  Negative
Without his anti-psychotic medication, Jerry talks to his dog Bosco and his cat Mr. Whiskers who are both perfectly voiced by Reynolds himselfwhich makes a twisted sense if you think about it.
  Negative
Bosco is the supportive angel to his loyal master while Mr. Whiskers is the devil on Jerrys shoulder, encouraging bad behavior and denigrating every attempt at normalcy.
  Negative
Jerry acts on his romantic interest in a gorgeous co-worker named Fiona  Gemma Arterton, asking her out for Chinese food.
  Neutral
After she stands him up, he happens upon her in the road, offering her a ride home.
  Positive
A car crash leads to an accidental death, and before you know it Fionas head is in Jerrys fridge.
  Negative
And its still talking to him.
  Neutral
Bosco tries to convince Jerry that hes still a good guy but Fiona wants a friend in the lonely refrigerator.
  Neutral
Mr. Whiskers thinks thats a grand idea.
  Neutral
Theres a great sequence about halfway through The Voices in which Jerry gives in and takes his meds as ordered, waking up to a world that he doesnt want to live in.
  Positive
He has no friends without the voices in his headpets.
  Negative
And the talking head of Fiona in his dementia is much more appealing than the reality of a decomposing head in his refrigerator.
  Positive
The Voices is the tale of a man who cant look back, really since the death of his mother, or hell really go insane.
  Negative
Once you start talking to your pets, theres no turning around.
  Negative
And thats what Reynolds truly captures: the idea that Jerry is a man forced down a road of violence by things that he cannot control.
  Negative
He is a unique serial killer in that he so wants normalcy, companionship and happiness.
  Positive
The joy in Reynolds eyes when he is shown human kindness by another co-worker the always-great  Anna Kendrick is as key to this performance as the insanity that other actors would have focused on and turned into scenery chewing.
  Negative
Reynolds uses his natural charm and good looks to great effect here.
  Positive
Hes the boy next door' the smiling co-worker whos both easy to root for and remarkably annoying in the same breath.
  Negative
It may be hard to believe until you see it but this is a truly subtle take on a man who has conversations with his pets.
  Positive
Its really great work.
  Positive
The final act of The Voices doesnt quite connect like I hoped it would.
  Positive
Satrapi seems to enjoy the set-up more than the climax, almost as if shes sorry to see Jerrys dark forces come to their inevitable conclusion as well.
  Negative
I also wish we werent presented with a tonally jarring back story for Jerry in which his insanity is given hereditary background.
  Negative
We dont need a reason for Jerry, and it feels like a different film intruding on the world of this one when its presented.
  Negative
Reynolds brings the character to life in such an interesting way that explaining him in flashback feels like the wrong move.
  Neutral
Maybe even Satrapi didnt realize the moment her star is having either.
  Neutral
