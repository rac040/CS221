The word iconic is said for the first time less than one minute into this documentary.
  Negative
It is uttered a second time before the movies second minute is up, this time by no less a personage than Donald Trump, whos called a real estate entrepreneur in the on-screen title that first introduces him.
  Negative
Harry Benson, now , is a Scotland-born photographer who came to prominence chronicling the first international tour of  The Beatles.
  Negative
Among the iconic images hes captured are winning shots of the Fab Four, in their  moptop mode, engaging in a high-energy, smile-filled pillow fight in a bedroom of Paris Georges Cinq hotel.
  Positive
A montage of these images is accompanied in this film by celebrity interviewee Dan Rather intoning, in serious-verging-on-pompous tones, the historical boilerplate about how in the wake of the assassination of John F. Kennedy, America was ready for something to cheer it up again, and what with the young people coming up, the Beatles were just the thing, and blah blah blah.
  Very negative
This sequence nicely encapsulates everything thats wrong and right about this movie, directed by  Justin Bare and  Matthew Miele.
  Negative
The duos prior filmography, containing titles like Crazy About Tiffanys and Scatter My Ashes At Bergdorfs, indicates just which side of the railroad tracks they most enjoy spending time on.
  Negative
Hence, this is a picture that luxuriates in its celebrity power.
  Positive
In addition to Trump and Rather, the filmmakers get onscreen testimonials about Benson from the likes of  Alec Baldwin,  Sharon Stone, Bryant Gumbel,  Carl Bernstein,  James L. Brooks, and Henry Kissinger.
  Negative
Also included are a lot of top-drawer media folk, the most entertaining of whom is, of course Andr Leon Talley.
  Positive
Its impressive, kind of, but its also a little distracting.
  Positive
In part because Benton himself is such a good raconteur.
  Positive
Recalling his assignment to follow the Beatles around, he tells of bristling at the job: I wanted to go to Africa.
  Negative
I was a SERIOUS JOURNALIST.
  Neutral
With a frankness that distinguishes all of his recollections and observations, he reveals that he got the job because the other photographer at his paper was ugly.
  Negative
One couldnt be around the Beatles if you were ugly, Benson says.
  Negative
Contemporary pictures of Benson show a serious-looking handsome gent with a healthy shock of brown hair.
  Positive
A companionable seeming fellow.
  Positive
This quality served him well when he went on more dangerous assignments, covering the Ku Klux Klan during the civil rights movement era, befriending Martin Luther King Jr..
  Negative
He was admitted to Kings hotel room after the leader's murder, where he captured some very unusual shots.
  Negative
He then joined Robert Kennedys presidential campaign, and his camera documented some of the terrible and memorable images of the late politician directly after his shooting.
  Negative
Among these is an image of Ethel Kennedy with her hand raised, trying to block Benson.
  Negative
Bensons reflections on his actions at the time are interesting.
  Positive
Hes there as a photo journalist' its his job to capture the moment, no matter how awful the moment.
  Negative
Still.
  Neutral
Benson, apparently a man of faith, muses that when he meets Kennedy in the next life he clearly liked and admired the man I think hell understand.
  Negative
Benson makes similar wishes about  John Lennon, because Benson also took some very provocative images of Lennons killer, Mark David Chapman.
  Positive
Benson reveals that Chapman actually took the photographer aside and said to him, Im sorry I killed your friend.
  Negative
These moments are the best things in the movie, but theyre fleeting.
  Positive
As much if not more time is spent on a  Jack Nicholson photo shoot in which the pictures captured a foreign substance dangling from a Nicholson nostril hair news flash, Jack Nicholson possibly used cocaine in the s or indulging the non-Benson interviewees.
  Negative
Carl Bernstein is allowed to discourse on celebrity semiotics.
  Negative
Examining Bensons funny and charming photos of the Beatles with  Muhammad Ali a meeting engineered by Benson in Miami, Bryant Gumbel drones By image, by name, by voice, I dont think there was ever a more famous person on the planet than Ali.
  Negative
I know that documentary filmmakers today feel the need to Explain Things To The Kids, but, not to put too fine a point on it, at this late date you also need someone to explain to the kids who Bryant Gumbel was.
  Negative
Similarly, Benson will be explaining something about his process You want to kill something, bring it into the studio and boom, the filmmakers cut to Cecilia Guest another one who needs explaining to the kids prattling about how Benson shot her topless lolling by the swimming pool, and how scandalized her mother was, and who cares.
  Negative
In the films last third, it finds a different footing, visiting Bensons Glasgow roots, his oldest friend, and telling of his latter-day journeys covering famines, infitadas, and more.
  Positive
The filmmakers are themselves too celebrity besotted to comment in a meaningful way on how Bensons career balanced depictions of the rich and famous with in-the-trenches risk-taking.
  Negative
But Benson himself hits on something pertinent when he speaks of shooting  Truman Capotes Black and White Ball in the late s: Now it seemed much more interesting than it seemed then.
