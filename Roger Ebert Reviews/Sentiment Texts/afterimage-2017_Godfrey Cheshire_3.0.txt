Afterimage, the final film by Polands  Andrzej Wajda, is a fitting coda to the career of one of world cinemas giants.
  Positive
Unlike fellow Poles such as  Roman Polanski and  Jerzy Skolimowski, who decamped for the Wests freedoms not long after their careers launched, Wajda, who died at  following the films premiere at last falls Toronto International Film Festival, remained in Poland trying to examine that countrys modern history and mores.
  Negative
Prior to the collapse of Soviet Communism, his efforts often led to difficulties with Polands Communist regime, which in turn gave him a theme that recurs in Afterimage: the necessity for individuals and artists to resist the soul-crushing demands and cruelties of totalitarian governments.
  Negative
Without question, the new film will mean most to viewers familiar with Wajdas work.
  Neutral
When he burst onto the scene in the s, his great trilogy of Generation, Kanal and Ashes and Diamonds anticipated the stylistic energy and sophistication of the French New Wave while also registering the disillusionment and complex feelings of young Poles who had suffered the horrors of both Nazism and Communism.
  Positive
Though often constrained by the authorities in the following decade, he captured the anti-Communist ferment of the Solidarity era in Man of Marble  and "Man of Iron" , a struggle he retrospectively celebrated in Walesa: Man of Hope .
  Negative
Wajdas father was a Polish cavalry officer who died in s Katyn Massacre, in which, at Stalins orders, Soviet secret police methodically put bullets through the heads of , men who represented the cream of Polish society.
  Negative
At the time the Nazis and Soviets were allies, but after the alliance broke apart and the Germans invaded, the Soviets blamed the crime on the Nazis, a denial that stood as official policy until  and was widely parroted by Soviet apologists in the West.
  Negative
Churchill and Roosevelt knew the truth but directed their governments to suppress it for the sake of good relations with Stalin.
  Negative
Some of the documents concerning the massacre remain classified in Russia, so its no surprise that it took Wajda until  to release the stark, uncompromising  Katyn, which was nominated for an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film.
  Negative
Written by  Andrzej Mularczyk, the author of the book on which Katyn was based, Afterimage might be considered a companion piece to the earlier work.
  Negative
Both films are grim, clear-eyed looks at the predations of Stalinism, though this time the setting is not war but peacetime.
  Negative
Its  when we meet Wladyslaw Strzeminki the great Boguslaw Linda, an artist in his early s whos missing an arm and a leg due to injuries suffered in World War I. Considered Polands most renowned painter, Strzeminski is also a noted theoretician and a beloved teacher at the Higher School of Visual Arts in Lodz.
  Negative
His fame and popularity do not, however, protect him when the Stalinist thought police come calling.
  Negative
Wajda announces this in a witty, visually arresting scene early on.
  Positive
Strzeminski is in his apartment about to paint when his canvas, then the whole room, suddenly turns red.
  Negative
A giant banner celebrating Stalin has been hoisted in front of his window.
  Negative
He rips a hole in it to let in the daylight, committing an infraction thats only the beginning of his troubles with authority.
  Negative
A bigger problem is that he believes in two things that are anathema to the cultural powers-that-be: abstract art and the autonomy of the artist.
  Neutral
The former is increasingly verboten as Soviet socialist realism becomes the only officially sanctioned style of painting and all forms of non-representational and avant-garde art are denounced as examples of Western decadence and American cosmopolitanism a word that in Communist contexts usually has undertones of anti-Semitism, though Wajda doesnt stress these.
  Very negative
As for artistic autonomy, thats also disallowed' artists are meant to serve not themselves but the masses, the collective, the Party even if the resulting "art" is the sheerest propagandistic kitsch.
  Negative
Strzeminski supposedly knew Chagall, Kandinsky and Malevich, but we never hear any mention of friends in the West who might help him escape Poland, as other artists did.
  Negative
Likewise he has a young daughter the excellent  Bronislawa Zamachowska he cares for and a female student Zofia Wichlacz who cares very much for him, but neither relationship can put the skids on his rapid downward trajectory.
  Negative
First, he is relieved from his teaching position.
  Neutral
Then he sees the removal of his famous Neo-Plastic Room from the Lodz museum, and the utter destruction of a thesis art show by his students.
  Negative
Some of these bright-eyed young people would love to stand by him, defend him, but they are told that doing so would mean sacrificing their own futures.
  Negative
When he is de-credentialed as an artist, it means he can no longer get work.
  Negative
In a bitter irony, he secretly gets a job painting giant Stalin posters, but when his status is discovered, hes dismissed from that humiliating position too.
  Negative
Soon enough he finds out that not having credentials means he cant even buy paints, or food.
  Negative
How will he live?
  Neutral
Hes told that under Communism those who dont work dont eat.
  Neutral
Afterimage is mounted in a classical, beautifully understated style that throughout conveys the assurance of a true master.
  Positive
Its one of those films that doesnt ask to be liked or admired, but only to be heard.
  Neutral
Like Darkness at Noon, Nineteen Eighty-Four and other anti-Communist literary classics, its descent into the hell of totalitarianism isnt softened by a glimmer of solace at the end.
  Negative
Its the testimony of an artist who has seen the worst of Polish history and demands that it not be forgotten.
  Negative
