When writerdirector  Sian Heder introduced Tallulah at this years past Sundance Film Festival, it was revealed that she was around six months pregnant during production.
  Negative
She also shared that when she received the call about the festival accepting her film, her sentiment was more or less Cool  I have a baby on my boob.
  Positive
Heders movie, playing in select theaters and available on Netflix, is unabashedly about this very physical and emotional commitment to the life-changing event of motherhood, conveyed with an albeit drawn-out story.
  Positive
In its greatest achievement, Heder's writing and directing ofTallulah articulates or feels like it does, to my humbled, male eyes the intangible sacrifice and stresses of motherhood.
  Negative
Heders script is narratively ambitious with this mission, centered on a stolen baby and three moms who are bad in ways different to this weeks mainstream comedy release  Bad Moms.
  Negative
Ellen Page plays Tallulah shortened to Lu, a gutter punk living on the road with her boyfriend Nico  Evan Jonigkeit, sharing a lack of personal responsibility and connection to the world outside of their van.
  Negative
When he ditches her after deciding that he doesnt want to slum it anymore, Lu heads to New York City to scrounge for food, and get money from Nicos estranged mother Margo  Allison Janney, in a career-best role.
  Negative
Margo too is isolated from the world, living alone with a pet turtle in an apartment owned by the husband shes separated from, but unwilling to officially divorce.
  Negative
While stealing room service leftovers from outside hotel rooms, Tallulah is recruited by a disaster of a housewife named Carolyn  Tammy Blanchard to watch her baby while she goes out to desperately impress a man.
  Negative
In a fantastic introductory scene, Blanchard broadcasts the dangerous nature of a mother who has lost focus of everything outside of herself.
  Positive
She whips up a tornado of stress in just one interaction with Lu, ping-ponging between prepping her body while not caring whether her naked baby makes a mess on the carpet.
  Positive
When Carolyn passes out later in the evening, Tallulah takes the baby to her van for a safe sleep' when the police are in the hotel lobby the next morning, Lu heads over to Margos place, and claims that the baby belongs to her and Nico.
  Negative
Margo reluctantly hosts Lu and her "new" granddaughter, but begins to relate to Tallulah in ways surprising to both women.
  Positive
As Heder is most of all interested in making time for Lu and Margos growing bond, her script has a couple of cringing contrivances to keep the police at bay, like Margo not seeing Lus face on the news' even a stolen baby functions more like a narrative device.
  Negative
Tallulah becomes unexpectedly conversational, touching upon the type of privilege it is to have and care for someone, through two people who have no immediate answers.
  Positive
The dialogue can spell some of her ideas out pretty clearly, like when Lu says, I think its better to not be needed, but that's a minor complaint not enough films have so directly engaged motherhood as a philosophy and not just a character trait.
  Negative
It helps, too, that the performances are so good' the way that Pages emotional shifts from loner to mother and back again make her actions unpredictable but believable, or how Janney brings in a wise, dark comedy to someone who has a sturdy wall of defense, which crashes down during an unexpected moment with her turtle.
  Very positive
Similar casting to  Juno be damned, Heders script boasts a fullness, and bringing Janney amp' Page back together becomes a nice gift, as their chemistry proves to be bigger than the  film.
  Very positive
Tallulah is an impressive debut from Heder, who also works as a writer on Netlfixs Orange Is the New Black  Uzo Aduba, who plays Crazy Eyes on the series, has a part as a child services agent with a lot of perspective.
  Positive
Shes a storyteller who truly loves her characters, to the point that shell jeopardize pacing with daydreams and extra moments, stretching a tight pitch about a missing baby from  minutes into two hours.
  Positive
But her vivid magic is in the organic fictional beings.
  Positive
They have a lot to say, and are well worth listening to.
