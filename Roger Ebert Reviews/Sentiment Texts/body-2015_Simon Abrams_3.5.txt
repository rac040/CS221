A warning: "Body" is a gripping whodunit that you should ideally watch knowing as little beforehand as possible.
  Positive
Co-writerdirector duo  Dan Berk and  Robert Olsen have a knack for drawing viewers in and surprising them without taking any narrative, or technical short-cuts.
  Positive
There's no flashbacks, hyper edits, shaky camerawork, or backstories.
  Negative
For these reasons, "Body" feels downright old-fashioned: a thriller with tension that doesn't stem from gore, jump scares, or other cheap shock tactics, but rather a creeping dread that grows with each red herring, and slow-burn plot twist.
  Negative
This poses an immediate problem for me, your humble reviewer: how to describe this movie without giving too much away?
  Negative
You should see "Body" if you like thrillers with strong female leads that make you peek between your fingers, and lose your breath gasping at violence but not grisly violence.
  Neutral
It is as close to an across-the-board, qualification-less strong genre movie that you can watch with anyone, be they your mom, your sweetheart, or your pet chinchilla Schnookums.
  Negative
If that sounds good to you, and you don't want to have your viewing experience ruined, get out of here now.
  Negative
My feelings won't be hurt, go on.
  Negative
No, really, go.
  Neutral
It's ok, honest.
  Positive
Go, go, get out of here.
  Neutral
Ok, are they gone?
  Negative
Good.
  Positive
Hi again.
  Neutral
Now that those quitters have left, let's pick up where I left off.
  Negative
"Body" is an exceptional thriller, full stop.
  Positive
The film's main focus isn't convoluted plot devices, psychologically complex characters, or exceptionally grisly make-up effects.
  Negative
"Body" won't change your life, make you cry, teach you a profound truth, or get inside your head and take up residence for days afterward.
  Negative
Instead, it's about atmosphere, and not the kind threatened by abysmal mud-bright mood lighting, or cheap-jack production values.
  Negative
Like a really good roller coaster, the -minute "Body" is over and done with in a flash, but the ride itself, and thrill you get from it lingers.
  Positive
When it's over, you'll want to get right back on.
  Negative
The film follows three twenty-something women on the night before Christmas Eve.
  Neutral
Cali  Alexandra Turshen and Holly  Helen Rogers visit their friend Melissa  Lauren Molina at Melissa's parents' house.
  Negative
As the night winds down, they decide to take a late-night drive.
  Negative
On their way, they pass a hitchhiker with a creepy beard.
  Negative
They ultimately arrive at a palatial home, where more booze is consumed, and fun is had.
  Negative
Then the girls realize they're not alone.
  Neutral
Until this point, "Body" revels in naturalistic, light dialogue.
  Negative
Turshen, Roger, and Molina have genuine sisterly camaraderie, so much so that it doesn't matter that the dialogue and situations they find themselves in before being discovered is so light that you'll barely remember it when the film ends.
  Positive
That's actually the secret of the film's success: it maintains a certain tempo and interest that you're so immediately involved you don't even realize you're being sucked in.
  Positive
A perfect example of the unassuming spell "Body" casts: Larry Fessenden's excellent performance as ... well, I can't really tell you that.
  Positive
Fessenden, a horror filmmaker who has nurtured several talented American indie horror filmmakers at his own Glass Eye Pix distribution label, is an exceptional character actor.
  Positive
He steals every scene he's in, and his big scene in "Body" is no different.
  Positive
Fessenden is an ideal bit player: he lures viewers in without going so far over the top that his performance seems to hail from a completely different film.
  Positive
He can be a ham, but Fessenden's performance in "Body" is magnetic, and leaves you feeling like you've been turned inside-out.
  Positive
But "Body" is not about Fessenden.
  Neutral
He's a key part of the film's success, but no single part of the movie is more important than the rest.
  Positive
The film's exceptionally consistent mood is its main appeal.
  Positive
For that reason, "Body" reminded me of supposedly minor  Alfred Hitchcock masterworks "Dial M for Murder" and " Rope."
  Neutral
In those earlier thrillers, Hitchcock's unmistakable talent serves ideas that seem to evaporate, or at least lose their thematic weight as soon as soon as you're done watching.
  Positive
One can only hope that Berk and Olsen's body of work grows to the point where "Body" is unfairly remembered as a minor success.
  Neutral
Still, right now, we're at the beginning of Berk and Olsen's promising career, and most viewers don't know that "Body" is a must-see.
  Positive
"Body" may be the kind of genre film you take for granted, but there's nothing inessential about a sharp, well-crafted thriller just because it's not particularly flashy, and doesn't have any big ideas.
  Negative
No, "Body" may not be the kind of modern-day B-movie that wins awards, but it does exactly what it sets out to, and that's a fair amount.
  Positive
So go ahead: see this film for yourself.
  Positive
You won't know what hit you.
  Negative
