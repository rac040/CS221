You may have already heard that Rock Dog, a new animated movie from an outfit thats not Pixar and not Disney and not Dreamworks and not the People Who Gave You  Ice Age and not the People Who Gave You  Minions and  Despicable Me is, besides not being from a proven provider of child-distracting content, also a movie that features a character whos a yak and is named Fleetwood Yak.
  Negative
All these things are true.
  Positive
Rock Dog is a KoreanChinese co-production crafted by largely American animation artists.
  Positive
Portions of its scenario may look like theyve been inspired by the likes of  Kung Fu Panda but the actual source material for the movie is a Chinese graphic novel called Tibetan Rock Dog by  Zheng Jun, whose day job is as a Chinese rock musician.
  Negative
And yes, there is a character in it whos a yak named Fleetwood Yak.
  Negative
But to be honest thats really the most objectionable joke in the whole feather-light, primary-color filled, shorter-than- minute movie.
  Negative
Whats interesting about Rock Dog is just how very unapologetically a kids movie it is.
  Positive
True, the voice cast for the American version is designed to have some adult appeal.
  Positive
The aforementioned Fleetwood Yak is voiced by  Sam Elliott, and the role of the yak is structurally a nod to Mr. Elliotts work in  The Big Lebowski.
  Negative
But this movie, despite being about a dog who wants to play rock music, has no winky pop-culture references besides that.
  Negative
The comic actors doing voice work, who also include  Luke Wilson,  Lewis Black,  Matt Dillon, J.K. Simmons,  Kenan Thompson, and  Eddie Izzard, all do their jobs with relish and dispatch, but theres nothing clever-clever about it.
  Negative
The story is dopily simple.
  Positive
In the Asian mountain Tibet is not prominently mentioned here, an alliance of guard dogs and self-shearing lambs have managed to form a society that happily keeps predatory wolves at bay.
  Negative
The mastiff patriarch Khampa Simmons has come to believe music has no part in this society too distracting and has banned it.
  Negative
His good-natured but lacking-in-fire son Bodi Wilson, slouching around in a very neat wool cap that nonetheless manages to scream stoner, is traipsing through a valley one day when a radio falls from a plane.
  Negative
Once he tunes into a particular station, he cant believe what he hears at all.
  Negative
He starts dancing to that fine, fine music, and so on.
  Positive
He breaks out a kotoguitar from the village storeroom and gets to strumming, which gets to annoying his dad.
  Negative
But the old mans a softie, and gives him a bus ticket to the big city, where he hopes to go to Rock Park and learn from his new idol, rotter rock star Angus Scattergood.
  Negative
The arrival of Bodi attracts the notice of a wolf pack, led by Linnuxx Black, who, having been banished from his mountain source of lamb chops, now runs mixed-martial-arts events in the local sports arena and thugs around ineffectually with his gang.
  Negative
So Linnuxx here sees an opportunity to get back at Khampa.
  Neutral
In the meantime, charmingly nave Bodi flops big in Rock Park, but is reluctantly adopted by pompous Angus Izzard, whos having a devil of a time writing his long-overdue new single, and is intrigued by Bodi, whose burgeoning talent sees him creating a very nice blue fire when he strums his guitar.
  Negative
All this is every bit as silly and innocuous as it sounds, and it goes down, if not like honey, than like very finely spun cotton candy.
  Negative
I had to pay to see this movie like any other civilian.
  Neutral
The distributors were not screening it for digital press, so despite my protestations that I liked rock, and that while Im generally more of a cat person I also like dogs, so how bad was my review likely to be, I couldnt get headway.
  Negative
So I trudged to my local multiplex at two this afternoon.
  Neutral
On the way up to the theater I saw a nanny with a gaggle of six-year-olds, and I was like, Are you guys going to see Rock Dog?
  Negative
Me too?
  Neutral
And I realized maybe this was not a good look for an overweight man in his fifties by himself to be sporting.
  Negative
In any event, despite all the many things that Rock Dog is not one of which is filled with rock music' there are snippets of a Foo Fighters song and snippets of a Radiohead song and one original song and thats kind of it I can report that it enraptured and delighted, and most importantly, made quiet, the houseful of little kids and their nannies with which I watched it.
  Negative
If this is an experience your current moviegoing habits call for, see Rock Dog with confidence.
  Positive
