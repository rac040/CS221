Albert Camus short story,  The Guest, rather resembles Ernest Hemingways The Killers in that it uses an almost anecdotal storyline to illuminate major hell, one might even say existential themes.
  Very negative
Camus work has only three characters: a police officer, his prisoner, and a schoolteacher the police officer charges with taking said prisoner to a court and jail a couple of hours away.
  Negative
The teachers refusal sets the tale in motion, demonstrating how choice is destiny, but sometimes choice is not an option.
  Negative
Hemingways somehow even sparser story focuses on its two title characters, and a man called The Swede, their victim, who offers his murderers no resistance' recounted second hand, the tellers of the tale ponder The Swedes stoic acceptance of his fate.
  Negative
The Killers was made into a movie in the late s, one that extrapolated The Swedes backstory in full.
  Negative
A pretty great film noir directed by Robert Siodmak and starring  Burt Lancaster and  Ava Gardner.
  Positive
But an almost entirely different animal in spirit than Hemingways great story.
  Negative
Similarly, writerdirector  David Oelhoffen expands the parameters of Camus story, set in Algeria in the early s, in "Far From Men".
  Negative
Schoolteacher Daru, a quiet, self-possessed man, is played by  Viggo Mortensen' his charge, Mohamed, by Reda Kateb.
  Negative
This expansion of the story sees Daru escorting Mohamed even as he encourages the prisoner to break away.
  Negative
As the two men grow to trust each other, the impossibility of Mohameds situation is illuminated.
  Negative
Yes, he is guilty of a crime.
  Negative
The crime, he says, was the result of a him-or-me-and-my-family decision.
  Negative
Left to hang by themselves, though, his actions will create an endless and destructive cycle of recrimination.
  Neutral
If he escapes, he insists, nothing will be solved.
  Negative
Only his own sacrifice will make things right.
  Neutral
Getting killed by the French is the only solution.
  Negative
Daru has a hard time grasping this.
  Negative
Their journey offers other challenges as it progresses.
  Positive
There is rain.
  Neutral
The Algerian rebellion against French rule had begun.
  Negative
It hasnt had much impact on the mountain village where Daru teaches, but Daru and Mohamed meet some soldiers on their trip, which provides an opportunity for some backstory.
  Negative
It also recalls, in a low-key way, an episode from Leones The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly.
  Negative
There is a very understated brothel, recollecting The Last Detail.
  Positive
There is a lot of stark natural beauty, captured very well by cinematographer Guillame Deffontaines.
  Very positive
And there isnot a lot more, as it happens.
  Negative
In addition to muffing the dnouement of the story on which its based, Far From Men is also the kind of movie in which sobriety and a stalwart sense of seriousness yield more inertia than profundity.
  Negative
Its solemnity never becomes actively oppressive, but it shuts out not just humor but grace.
  Negative
What it falls back on, rather than the troubling truth illuminated in Camus story, is the movie-standard gaze of compassion, here proffered by Mortensen, who, it must be admitted, does it well.
  Negative
His French isnt bad either, although his character gets a backstory that explains its sometimes halting quality French natives are worse sticklers for accents than American movie critics, as it happens.
  Very negative
His work, and Katebs, are exemplary.
  Positive
Its also pleasant to see the great  Angela Molina, so memorable in Luis Buuels final film That Obscure Object of Desire, pop up here in a small role.
  Positive
But the movie remains something of a Distinguished Slog.
  Negative
