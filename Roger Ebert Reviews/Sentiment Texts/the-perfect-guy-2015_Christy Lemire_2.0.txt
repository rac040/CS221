This is the part of the movie where you kidnap me and sell my organs, right?
  Neutral
Sanaa Lathans character playfully asks  Michael Ealys on their way to an underground nightclub in The Perfect Guy.
  Negative
Nothing nearly so wacky or grotesque goes down in this romantic thriller, but youll wish it would.
  Negative
The Perfect Guy is decent trash that could have been delicious trash with a little more daring.
  Negative
Director  David M. Rosenthals film   which, tellingly, Sony did not screen for critics before opening day   is slick, glossy and sturdily made in a way thats reminiscent of similar sexy-stalker fare from the s. Its vaguely Verhoevenish.
  Negative
It features gorgeous actors in stylish settings with flattering lighting and fashionable clothing.
  Positive
Los Angeles shimmers in the daytime and glitters at night, and much of the action goes down in Lathans serene mid-century modern house in the hills Silver Lake, probably with floor-to-ceiling glass, minimalist furnishings and generous use of chunky Austin stone.
  Negative
Its all very tasteful   too much so, perhaps   which makes the few crazy moments stand out as unintentionally funny rather than cohesive parts of a whole.
  Positive
You keep hoping that an insane  Tyler Perry movie will burst free from these understated trappings, but no such luck.
  Negative
The overqualified, magnetic stars do their best with this tepid material, however.
  Negative
The script comes from  Tyger Williams, whose last screenplay was s  Menace II Society.
  Negative
Rosenthal, meanwhile, previously directed the appealing Janie Jones and the dreary  A Single Shot.
  Negative
Lathan, whos incapable of finding a dishonest moment on screen, stars as Leah Vaughn, an L.A.-based lobbyist who seems to have it all: brains, looks, power, a gorgeous home and a loving, longtime boyfriend in architect Dave the ubiquitous  Morris Chestnut.
  Negative
After two years together, Leah is ready to get married and start a family' Dave, whos been surrounded by divorce his whole life, isnt.
  Negative
So thats the end of that.
  Neutral
Conveniently, though, she meets cute not once but twice with a super-handsome guy named Carter Michael Ealy.
  Neutral
After sharing a flirty moment at a coffee shop, their paths cross again at a trendy restaurant when Carter swoops in to save Leah from a drunk dudes unwanted advances at the bar.
  Negative
He really is too good to be true   perfect, even, hence the title.
  Very positive
Besides his looks and his propensity for shirtless, sweaty pushups, Carter is attentive, thoughtful, doting and has a successful career as a high-tech corporate security expert, which will come in handy once he starts making her life a living hell.
  Positive
Because after the romantic dates, the passionate nightclub bathroom sex which is, again, tasteful and the heartwarming road trip to visit her parents in San Francisco  Charles S. Dutton and L. Scott Caldwell, Carter reveals his true nature when he savagely beats a stranger at a gas station for simply speaking to Leah.
  Positive
She is, naturally, disturbed and afraid.
  Positive
She pulls away like any strong, sane person would.
  Positive
This only makes Carter want her more, which he demonstrates by calling and texting her incessantly, breaking into her house, hiding surveillance equipment, hacking into her computer, stealing her cat and pushing her elderly across-the-street neighbor down a flight of stairs when she becomes suspicious of his antics.
  Negative
Theres no tension or even real fear in his transformation because it happens so quickly.
  Negative
Theres no arc to his personality: He goes from suave to psycho in the blink of an eye.
  Negative
Leah herself says it best when she confides in a girlfriend that its as if a switch had been flipped, and it renders his character more of an idea of a threat than a legitimate one.
  Negative
The moment when he sneaks into her bathroom and puts her toothbrush in his mouth just to experience the sensation of being near her should be deeply creepy, but it drew giggles at a late-night showing.
  Neutral
Ealy at least gets more to do here than Chestnut, whose main function is to return in the third act to stoically, heroically protect the woman he conveniently decides he loves again.
  Negative
His character is emblematic of whats wrong with the entire movie, come to think of it: He looks great but theres not much to him beneath the surface.
  Negative
