Nobody makes light-hearted farces like Spanish comedy "MyBigNight," a comedy about the filming of a New Year's Eve telecast in October, any more.
  Negative
The film seems to hail from a different time, though I'd be hard-pressed to say exactly what time that was.
  Negative
Directed and co-written by Spanish post-punkfilmmaker Alex de la Iglesia "Witching and Bitching", "MyBigNight" is aa hybrid of star-studded extravaganzas of the 's, like "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World," and the raunchy gag-centric spoofs of the 's and 's, like "Kentucky Fried Movie."
  Negative
There's also a surreal element to the film that reminded meof Luis Bunuel's " The Exterminating Angel," another absurdist comedy about people stuck in a room with no exits.
  Positive
"MyBigNight" brings all these films to mind because it's just as novel.
  Positive
The premise of "MyBigNight" is fine, but the film's execution is what really sells it.
  Positive
Jose Pepon Nieto, a dumpy-looking everyman, is hired as an extra after another schlubby-looking, non-descript patsy is crushed mercilessly by an ill-attended camera crane.
  Negative
Jose is then seated amongst a group of people who laugh, dance, and cheer whenever the camera crew needs them to.
  Positive
The booze and food on Jose's plate is fake, and his fellow guests are all restless: they try to guess the Wifi password, buy contraband alcohol, and show off their scars to each other while they wait for their next cue.
  Very negative
Jose's companions also have competing agendas since each feel that they are the show's real stars: aging pop singer Alphonso Raphael tries to steal a prized time slot from airheaded young rival Adanne  Mario Casas while fed-up personal assistant Yuri  Carlos Areces plots to murder his step-father Alphonso and co-hosts Roberto  Hugo Silva and Cristina  Carolina Bang bully each other just to get the best monologues.
  Negative
"MyBigNight" is thankfully full of inspired sight gags, and gut-busting dialogue.
  Negative
Don't ask me to list all ofmyfavorite moments from the film' there are too many.
  Negative
Most of the film's more inspired moments are small, though the film's cast earns belly laughs throughout.
  Positive
Sometimes I cracked up at something as minor as the robotic whooshing noise that Alphonso's chair makes as he spins around dramatically to confront Yuri.
  Negative
Sometimes it was a well-timed comedy routine that got me, like when Cristina gives Roberto an allergic reaction, and then tries to wrestle some A-material lines away from him while hehides half of his face behind various carnival masks.
  Negative
And sometimes I laughed in spite of myself at dumbbut well-performed, paced, and shot jokes, like when Adanne promises his manager Perotti Tomas Pozzi that he will not have any more affairs while he covertly receives oral pleasure from a groupie.
  Positive
This gag could have easily misfired given how many of the film's women come across like gold-diggers, crazies, or nymphos.
  Negative
De la Iglesia parodies phonies of both genders, but he comes down especially hard onsuperficial femalecharacters like Cristina and Adanne's treacherous little friend she tries to blackmail him.
  Negative
You can tell that de la Iglesia cares about all of his characters, and even approves of working-class women like crew memberslovers Rosa and Amparo  Carmen Machi and  Carmen Ruiz and Jose's love interestfellow extra Paloma  Blanca Suarez.
  Negative
But there's something almost hatefully juvenile about some of de la Iglesias's woman-hating jokes, particularly a sequence where Jose is ushered through a changing room, while several dancers have their silicon-enhanced, gravity-defying breasts bared.
  Negative
Still, it's the timing of jokes in "MyBigNight" that sell them, like the sour, nervous look Paloma gives Jose when she alludes to a previous love affair that endedafter a mysterious "mayonnaise incident."
  Negative
Or the bit where one mortified extra complains that her Samsung Galaxy phone is broken, and her companion rails "I shit on your Galaxy!"
  Neutral
I fell in love with this film because of the way the PA system blareswhen the crew tries to get Jose to pick his mom up.
  Negative
And the mortified expression on Nieto's face when he explains to Paloma that his mother has been clutching a giant crucifix to her chest "since she tore it off dad's coffin."
  Negative
I laughed a lot at "MyBigNight" and can't recommend it highly enough.
  Positive
