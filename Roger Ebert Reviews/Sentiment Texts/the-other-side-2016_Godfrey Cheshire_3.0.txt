If it were possible to splice the DNA of  William Faulkner and  John Cassavetes, the resulting progeny might produce a film like  Roberto Minervinis The Other Side, an immersive, almost harrowingly naturalistic plunge into the lives of marginal Louisianans obsessed with guns, drugs and belligerent resentments.
  Negative
The problem with the above description, though, is that Faulkner and Cassavetes dealt in the realm of the fictional.
  Negative
The Other Side has been described in some reviews as a documentary.
  Negative
Yet Minervini an Italian now based in the U.S. clearly operates in a netherworld between fiction and reality.
  Neutral
A better comparison in terms of method, if not tone might be films like Trash and Heat that  Paul Morrissey made for  Andy Warhol, elaborating on a deadpan approach the artist had developed in his earlier films.
  Negative
In the Warhol-Morrissey features, the camera mainly sat back and observed the assembled junkies, drag queens and hustlers from a neutral distance.
  Negative
Minervini, on the other hand, uses cinematographer Diego Romero's gorgeously underlit, smoothly hand-held camerawork to create an effect that, because it is more intimate and beautifully crafted, also feels more like that of a fictional film.
  Very positive
As in the Warhol-Morrissey films, what we see here arent actors acting but real-life characters interacting, in a context that gives their personalities and relationships a loose narrative frame.
  Positive
As in those earlier films too, theres lots of casual drug use, nudity and some sex.
  Negative
Its worth stressing at the outset, though, that these elements do not seem included for their prurient or entertainment appeal' the filmmakers purposes, clearly, might more accurately be described as exactingly anthropological.
  Negative
The film opens with men in hunting gear trailing through a wooded landscape.
  Negative
Then we see -ish Mark Mark Kelley lying beside a country road in the early morning light, naked, evidently either drunk or stoned.
  Neutral
He gets up and staggers down the road, and later meets his corpulent, disheveled girlfriend Lisa Lisa Allen and smokes crack with her.
  Negative
The two have an easygoing banter that bespeaks both respect and jokey familiarity.
  Negative
Mark is a grizzled, tattooed guy, but not without a certain rugged charm and animal vitality.
  Negative
He looks a bit like  Mark Ruffalo might look if the actor had a meth habit.
  Negative
Though much of the time hes doing nothing but laying around, getting messed up or engaging in nude frolics with Lisa hes also the first of many folks here to launch into a venomous anti-Obama tirade we also see him doing some honest work in day jobs and trying to help out his family members, including a sister, niece, mother and grandmother.
  Negative
It emerges that Mark was convicted of a felony but has been able to postpone serving his prison time.
  Positive
His mother was recently diagnosed with cancer' when she dies, he tells Lisa, he plans to get drunk every day and then go serve his sentence in order to clean himself up.
  Negative
This plan and the emotions sparking it hint at a kind of dramatic shape and logic that the film, however, largely eschews in order just to follow the characters on their rounds, which include, for example, visiting a strip club where a very pregnant woman shoots up heroin backstage, then performs lewd dances for loud rowdies out front.
  Negative
These characters lives recall recent sociological studies on the changes lower-class whites have experienced since the s. Prior to that decade, traditional morality and religion held sway' hippies, dope and amorality were the enemy.
  Negative
But after the s' liberalizing winds swept through, the old standards fell away and nothing equally sustaining replaced then.
  Negative
Jesus went out, meth came in.
  Negative
If Minervini had been out to convert such realities into stark tragedy, he could have built up to Mark going into a nihilistic freefall or committing a despairing crime.
  Negative
Instead, very unconventionally, he simply drifts away from Mark and begins focusing on a group of camo-clad militia types, who delight in shooting off their weapons, cursing Obama and envisioning a national disaster ahead.
  Negative
Their tawdry, downscale world is one of Confederate flags, ammo boxes and  John Wayne posters.
  Negative
Its far easier to describe the films surface and thematic elements than to precisely convey Minervinis perspective and tone.
  Positive
As a native Southerner often skeptical of the way the region is portrayed in movies, especially ones made by outsiders, I am largely persuaded that Minervinis work is sincere and perceptive, and that it adds something new and valuable to the cinematic literature on the region.
  Positive
He doesnt indulge in caricature or sensationalism, any more than Faulkner did, even if some of the people he observes exist on the edge of grotesquerie.
  Negative
He sympathizes with them while keeping an observant distance and trying to capture the exact textures of their lives, much as Cassavetes did.
  Positive
His previous Texas Trilogy The Passage, Low Tide and Stop the Pounding Heart took a similarly naturalistic, if more lyrical, approach to other, less troubled Southern communities.
  Negative
The Other Side is a rougher ride, but one that further demonstrates his skills and acuity as an observer of Southern cultures.
  Negative
