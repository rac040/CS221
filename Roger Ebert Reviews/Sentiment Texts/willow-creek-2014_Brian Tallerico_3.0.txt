Writerdirector  Bobcat Goldthwait went camping and took two genres that should be at the end of their creative ropes the found-footage movie and the monster-in-the-woods movie with him in his latest genre oddity, "Willow Creek," now playing On Demand and in select theaters.
  Negative
He came back with something unexpected: a slow-burn horror flick that totally works on its own modest terms, offering an example of how well Goldthwait understands the importance of sound design and forced perspective while also offering a neat bit of gender politics and even commentary on the way we often seek that which we know we should not find.
  Very positive
Young filmmaker Jim  Bryce Johnson and his girlfriend Kelly  Alexie Gilmore set out to find Bigfoot, not really pausing long enough to think about what might happen if they find him.
  Negative
The title refers to the infamous source of the Bigfoot legend, an entire community built up around the reports of giant, hairy creatures that roam the nearby woods and what its done to the tourist industry.
  Negative
Giant statues of the big fella, murals, stories of missing campers, songs crafted about him, etc.
  Negative
Willow Creek rests on a bedrock of folklore.
  Neutral
And not everyone seems to be happy that Jim and Kelly are here to document it.
  Positive
They get plenty of "this might not be a good idea" warnings, most of them echoed by Kelly herself, a woman who seems to be a passenger on a trip built as much around her boyfriends ego as anything.
  Negative
Goldthwait cleverly includes multiple takes of Jims little speeches and introductions to interviews.
  Negative
This isnt a guy who just wants to get Bigfoot' he wants to be a star too.
  Negative
"Willow Creek" is a defiant slow burn.
  Negative
Jim and Kelly tour the community, talk to locals, and continuously prepare viewers for the inevitable.
  Positive
As hes proven in films like "Worlds Greatest Dad" and " God Bless America," Goldthwait is a smart filmmaker.
  Positive
He knows that you know that "Willow Creek" is going to get all "Blair Witch Project" eventually and so he plays with that expectation.
  Positive
Lesser filmmakers would have felt the need to have a sighting, a jump scare, a shock moment earlier in the film.
  Negative
Not Bobcat.
  Neutral
Youre going to hang out with Jim and Kelly credit to Johnson and Gilmore for very believable, unforced performances to the degree that, in one of my favorite moments when Jim proposes to Kelly, you almost forget that this is a monster movie.
  Positive
And then Bobcat reminds you.
  Positive
The centerpiece of "Willow Creek" is an extended sequence that everyone making a found footage film should be forced to watch.
  Negative
And take notes.
  Neutral
The camera doesnt move.
  Neutral
There are no quick cuts.
  Negative
There are no asides to the cameraaudience to break the tension.
  Negative
We are merely in the tent with Jim and Kelly, watching their faces and, most of all, listening.
  Negative
What is scarier than an unexplainable, unidentifiable sound in the pitch-black woods, miles from civilization?
  Neutral
"Willow Creek" makes the case that the answer is nothing.
  Negative
