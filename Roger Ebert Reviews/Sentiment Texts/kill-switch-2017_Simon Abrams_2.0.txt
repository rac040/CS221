The indie sci-fi film "Kill Switch" is the worst kind of science-fiction film: the kind that coasts on a central gimmick instead of delivering visceral or intellectual thrills.
  Negative
The gimmick in this case is that we navigatean alternate Earth as it's experienced by personality-less cypher  Will Porter "Legion" star  Dan Stevens, a former astronaut on a mission to save Earth from an evil mega-corporation.
  Negative
Director Tim Smit's extensive use of subjective, first-person photography is nothing new if you've played recent video games, many of which present events from the lead character's perspective.
  Negative
But action movies like last year's " Hardcore Henry," and a recent rise in the prominence virtual reality technology have presumably given viewers a growing curiosity for more video-game-like media.
  Negative
The thrill of exploring a completely foreign world as if you are actually there is still novel.
  Positive
Unfortunately, "Kill Switch" is not only cobbled together from other, superior films it also fails to articulate what makes those other moviesideas interesting.
  Very negative
Will makes bad judgment calls throughout "Kill Switch" that, if you watch enough movies, might make you question just how much time co-writers  Charlie Kindinger and  Omid Nooshin spent writing the film's screenplay.
  Negative
Will's myriad tactical errors will also make you question the character's limited personality, let alone his sanity.
  Neutral
After all, what kind of man signs on to work with Alterplex, a megalithic, mysterious company that promises to draw energy from an alternate Earth in order to power our planet in perpetuity?
  Negative
Doesn't that sound like something a bad guy would promise?
  Negative
Yes, they also promise to take care of Will's family ... should he agree to take on a mission that is never explained in great detail.
  Positive
Granted, there are elliptical gaps in our knowledge of what Will has experienced before he wakes up on an alternate Earth.
  Negative
Many of these gaps are filled by flashbacks that slow down what little momentum the film has.
  Negative
But let's deal with what we do know: Alterplex is represented by Abigail Berenice Marlohe, a chilly company shill who withholds whatever information she must ... until she winds up stuck in the line of fire with Will.
  Negative
Will wakes up on what he surmises is an alternate Earth.
  Neutral
He is immediately attacked by giant Alterplex drones and friendly colleague Michael  Tygo Gernandt, now an anti-Alterplex freedom fighter.
  Negative
Will, armed only with a glowing black box that everybody seems to want, must travel back to Alterplex's main structure.
  Negative
Along the way, he dodges the above-mentioned flying killer robots, plus giant airplanes, freighters, and other ships that haphazardly fall from the sky.
  Negative
It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that Will is working for bad people.
  Negative
Which is a shame, because apparently Will is not that smart.
  Negative
His struggle to make sense of how he could have been betrayed is laughably silly.
  Negative
It also doesn't reveal much about the world we live in.
  Negative
Will's ignorance and selfish desire to protect his own family above everyone else really doesn't say much about him.
  Negative
The whole point of this story is to realize that you can do the wrong thing for the right reasons simply by assuming you are being altruistic when in fact you are making other people's problems all about you.
  Negative
Will ultimately does learn that he has to make a sacrifice in order to make things right.
  Positive
But his road to self-abasement isn't very eventful.
  Negative
He gets shot at a lot.
  Positive
And he meets up with rebels that he immediately assumes must be bad.
  Negative
And he thinks about his family.
  Neutral
But at no point does Will tell us who he is beyond a blind will to get from plot point to plot point.
  Negative
He is to expository dialogue what Pez dispensers are to crummy fruit-flavored candy.
  Negative
Much of "Kill Switch" feels like an excuse to try out a new style of storytelling.
  Negative
If I were more cynical, I'd call this movie a calling card film, a klutzy attempt at jump-starting a movie career with nothing but gimcrack special effects, and low-budget ingenuity.
  Negative
Unfortunately, "Kill Switch" usually feels like a series of encounters you might find much more entertaining if you were controlling Will in a video game.
  Negative
You might have fun in that context because at least you would have the illusion of free choice, and could therefore enjoy the navigating an alien world at your own pace.
  Neutral
"Kill Switch" is, by contrast, limited to the story that Kindinger, Nooshin, and their collaborators chose to tell.
  Negative
Pez dispensers are fine for what they are.
  Positive
I just can't imagine them becoming the latest way to experience a movie.
  Negative
