The founder of this site once said a very wise thing.
  Positive
Well, he actually said quite a few very wise things, but heres one I go over and over pretty frequently: "There are two things you can't argue in film: comedy and eroticism.
  Negative
If something doesn't make you laugh, no one can tell you why it's funny, and it's difficult to reason someone out of an erection."
  Negative
Thats pretty funny in and of itself.

Anyway, Ive always respected Roger Eberts rule of comedy, which he articulated differently in various pieces over the course of his life, and which I distilled in my own mind as an instruction: If somethings funny, and you laugh at it a lot, youve gotta own it.
  Negative
If you know me at all, you also know that Ive got a laugh thats kind of hard not to own when I lose it, its pretty loud.
  Negative
I think Fox Searchlight bought  Napoleon Dynamite at Sundance partially in the strength of my reaction to the steak-throwing joke.
  Negative
So heres the breakdown: I laughed like a maniac at the Michael-Caine-impersonation reprise performed by comic actors  Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon at the front end of The Trip To Italy, the followup to call this a sequel is kind of special pleading, really to  The Trip.
  Positive
The difference, by the way, being that in the prior film both are distilled from somewhat longer television mini-series-es broadcast in Great Britain the fellows gallivanted around the British countryside and in this picture they are in, you guessed it, Italy.
  Negative
To get back to the record, I also laughed like a maniac at the pictures end, in which Brydon and Coogan discuss various James Bonds in front of an appreciative audience of actors playing the publicist and teenage son of the characters played by Brydon and Coogan, who are lightly fictionalized versions of themselves.
  Positive
And I laughed consistently and appreciatively at many of the scenes in between, some of which depict the actors singing along to an Alanis Morrissette CD.
  Positive
So if you go in for allusive British humor that builds slowly from dry to uproarious, as executed by two absolute masters of the form, The Trip To Italy will work for you, I believe.
  Negative
I also think the film, directed, like the prior one, by the astute  Michael Winterbottom, is a somewhat smoother trip than the first.
  Positive
In that one, Coogan, whos better known internationally than Brydon, was the focus, and the movies plot, such as it was, was hooked into his work and personal anxieties as he took a break from his Hollywood career just as it entered a pivotal moment.
  Negative
Here the focus is on Brydon, who gets a call from Hollywood, and also succumbs to a vacation flirtation that results in a pretty serious domestic misstep.
  Positive
Because the viewer is arguably less familiar with Brydon, the fiction is more convincing' were spared the potential distraction of trying to separate andor combine the real person from the character hes playing.
  Negative
Which leaves us more focus for the incredible-looking Italian meals the pair sample these trips are foodie fodder for newspaper articles Brydon writes, and the impeccably delivered banter they exchange.
  Negative
It all looks scrumptious, which makes this movie a terribly refreshing one with which to close out the summer.
