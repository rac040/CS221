After that, any story involving orphans held a  huge appeal, and if it also took place in Victorian-era England, well,  even better.
  Positive
It was a fantasy that lasted for years.
  Positive
"The Boxtrolls,"  the latest film from the Oregon-based stop-motion studio LAIKA who  brought us " Coraline" and "ParaNorman", reminded me of getting lost in  those vividly told and sometimes awful stories of children going up  against a cruel adult universe.
  Negative
"The Boxtrolls," co-directed by  Graham Annable and  Anthony Stacchi, has a  darkness to it in the images and in its themes a darkness that is  practically existential in nature.
  Positive
It's potentially heavy stuff for  children, but children have been thrilling to "heavy stuff" since  stories for children were invented.
  Positive
What "The Boxtrolls" does is create  an entire hierarchical world, with strict rules governing that  structure, and it introduces us to a cast of eccentric and often  grotesque characters who live and breathe in that fetid air.
  Positive
It's  gloriously inventive, wonderfully funny, and gorgeous to look at, the  screen filled with sometimes overwhelming detail.
  Very positive
The universe "The  Boxtrolls" gives us is one both strange and familiar: a town that  exists in some kind of collective unconscious with its narrow streets, massive main square, teetering mansions and slimy alleyways.
  Neutral
It's out of a  fairy tale' it's medieval Europe' it's Dickens or the films of   Jean-Pierre Jeunet.

  Negative
He has a small  red-haired daughter named Winnie  Elle Fanning.
  Negative
The fearful silly  people of Cheesebridge have been led to believe, through rumor and scary  bedtime stories, that the Boxtrolls, little creatures who come out at  night and pick through the trash, are going to terrorize the town, steal  their children, and eat them.
  Negative
It is Cheesebridge's version of The Bogeyman.
  Neutral
At night, the "Snatchers", led by the snaggletoothed and bulbous-bellied  Archibald Snatcher  Ben Kingsley, come out, trolling the streets  looking for Boxtrolls.
  Negative
The goal is to exterminate the entire Boxtroll  population.
  Neutral
Archibald Snatcher is unscrupulous, and all he wants in life  is to give up his "red hat" lower-status and join the "white hats."

That selfish motivation makes him do terrible terrible things.
  Negative
He is  accompanied by a gruesome trio of helpers: Mr. Gristle  Tracy Morgan,  Mr. Pickles  Richard Ayoade and Mr. Trout  Nick Frost.
  Negative
Mr. Gristle  cackles with sociopathic glee at the thought of exterminating the  Boxtrolls and is so emotionally blunted he can only repeat the last word  of whatever was said to him.
  Negative
Mr. Pickles and Mr. Trout, however, are in  the midst of an ongoing crisis of conscience.
  Negative
At first, they believe  they are on the side of law and order, they are the "good guys."
  Positive
Increasingly, though, they're not so sure, and they try to reassure one  another with unconvincing supportive statements.
  Negative
Meanwhile, we meet the Boxtrolls.
  Neutral
The Boxtroll lair is a  beautifully-imagined space: a gigantic cave, crammed full of found  objects, gears, lightbulbs and toasters' things thrown away by the  Cheesebridge residents.
  Negative
The Boxtrolls speak, but we don't understand  their language, and there are no subtitles.
  Negative
The Boxtrolls exist as  beautiful evidence of the sheer power and clarity of pantomime.
  Positive
They  babble and gurgle to one another, and we understand every word.
  Negative
Among the  Boxtrolls is a little boy named Eggs  Isaac Hempstead Wright, named  so because that's the word on the box he wears like a bulky sweater.
  Negative
Eggs' Boxtroll mentor is a kindly, worried little creature named Fish   Dee Bradley Baker, who looks suspiciously like  Abe Vigoda a  connection with his Boxtroll name?
  Negative
The two play music together.
  Neutral
They  are friends.
  Neutral
Eggs has always lived with the Boxtrolls, and thinks he is a  Boxtroll.

  Negative
The  streets of Cheesebridge are steep and twisting, with lonely streetlights  struggling to emanate their light through the blue gloom.
  Negative
There is a  gigantic bouncing cheese wheel, catapulting itself down the slopes like  some engine of doom and destruction, both hilarious and scary.
  Negative
After a  night of scavenging, the Boxtrolls stack themselves into a sleeping  formation, and, overhead, the bare lightbulbs they have hung from the dirt  ceiling turn their lair into a place of wonder and magic.
  Negative
These images  have great emotional resonance.
  Positive
The details of the costumes are amazing,  the frayed stitching on Snatcher's waistcoat, the tiered ruffles of  Winnie's pink dress, the gleaming ridiculous badges sewn onto the front  of Portley-Rind's coat.
  Negative
The images do not have a modern gleam, they are  not slick.
  Negative
They feel slightly tattered, hand-made, deteriorating.
  Negative
Without being didactic, "The Boxtrolls" presents the dangers of a  hierarchical society, separated out into high-status and low, and also  has some very interesting and moving things to say about identity,  family, and morality.
  Positive
There is a suggestion that a moral compass exists  on its own, whether it has been nurtured in us or not.
  Negative
Critical thinking  skills means you look around and evaluate reality based on the evidence  right in front of you.
  Neutral
The residents of Cheesebridge, drowning in myth,  rumor, and the comfort of intermittent mob violence against the  Boxtrolls, are unable to do that.
  Negative
But Winnie slowly realizes she has  been lied to her whole life.
  Negative
She is able to evaluate her world and see  that the way things are set up is wrong and unfair.
  Positive
"The Boxtrolls" is a beautiful example of the potential in LAIKA's  stop-motion approach, and the images onscreen are tactile and layered.
  Positive
But, as always, it's the story that really matters, and the story told  here is funny, ugly, poignant and true.
  Positive
