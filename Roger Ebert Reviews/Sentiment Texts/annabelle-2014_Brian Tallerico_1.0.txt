A word of advice for horror movie producers: If youre going to riff on s horror classics like The Omen and  Rosemarys Baby, make sure to look more deeply at why those films connected with viewers rather than just stealing their imagery.
  Negative
Merely mimicking them aesthetically is a hollow exercise, and proof that you dont understand that horror is more than a series of jump cuts and frightening images.
  Negative
Horror, at its best, taps into something deeper.
  Very positive
Theres nothing deep about Annabelle, the spin-off of  The Conjuring.
  Negative
It offerssurface level scares without the undercurrent of humanity needed to make them register.
  Negative
Director  John R. Leonetti and writer  Gary Daubermanwork proficiently enough on a technical level to craft a few scenes that get the heart racing, but the climax of Annabelle is so misguided, silly and even offensive that any excuse genre fans may be inclined to make for the mediocre hour-and-a half that precedes it will likely turn to rage.
  Negative
For the record and its worth noting because of how angry our original review of The Conjuring still makes fans of that film I was a fan of  James Wans  ghost story.
  Positive
The director took a giant leap forward in that work, proving he understands numerous elements that modern horror directors ignore, such as the use of sound design and setting to create tension.
  Very positive
These elements are discarded in Annabelle."
  Neutral
If you saw the  hit, you remember the creepy doll that wouldnt go away.
  Negative
Ghostbusters Lorraine and Ed Warren kept Annabelle in a locked case, recognizing the true evil held within.
  Negative
How did Annabelle go from a relatively harmless but totally creepy doll to a tool of the devil?
  Neutral
Annabelle tries to tell that story, using the Manson Murders and Rosemarys Baby as a backdrop.
  Negative
Some may be tempted to write off Annabelle on concept alone, in that its something of a cash grab, like a straight-to-video sequel designed to strike while a hit predecessor's iron is still hot.
  Negative
Still, I would argue that Annabelle has the core of a good film within it.
  Positive
It's about how changing times in the s, when otherwise safe neighborhood dwellers started locking their doors and apartment denizens began to suspect their neighbors' the iconography of youth became sinister.
  Neutral
You can sense shreds of this idea in Annabelle, but the film doesn't develop them.
  Negative
We learn that Annabelle was owned by a lovely young couple named Mia  Annabelle Wallis and John  Ward Horton.
  Negative
In the run-up to the birth of their first child,John gave his wife the doll as a part of her extensive collection.
  Negative
As Mia nears her due date, the couple faces unimaginable horror in the form of a pair of Satanic cultists who break in, stab Mia in the belly, and end up dead in their home.
  Negative
The female cultist happens to be named Annabelle Higgins, and some of her blood lands on the doll Annabelle.
  Negative
Before you know it, Mia is seeing shadowy figures on the stairs, hearing noises in the night and realizing that something evil wants her baby.
  Negative
Thematically, nothing in Annabelle is developed beyond a level that might make it suitable for horror movie manipulations.
  Negative
When we meet religious characters like Father Perez  Tony Amendola, Annabelle threatens to take on some " The Exorcist" or "The Omen"-like undertones, chronicling a time when some felt that Americans lost touch with their religious institutions.
  Negative
But the movie doesnt really go there.
  Negative
When no one believes Mias haunting stories, Annabelle threatens to become a piece about how new mothers can be ignored, their concerns portrayed as the byproduct of hormones.
  Negative
But this notion isn't developed, either.
  Negative
There are other problems.
  Negative
Wallis and Horton are remarkably unengaging leads.
  Positive
She mumbles, he over-emotes, and the doll is allowed to steal scenes.
  Negative
And the film is visually flat.
  Negative
Pan reveals panning across a door or room to reveal something in the background are over-used, and the sound is mixed to grating levels.
  Negative
Its a movie that screams "Boo!"
  Neutral
instead of trying to get under your skin.
  Negative
T here is one great set piece involving a storage unit in the basement and an elevator that just wont leave it, but thats something you can watch on cable later, while ignoring the weak film that surrounds it.
  Neutral
