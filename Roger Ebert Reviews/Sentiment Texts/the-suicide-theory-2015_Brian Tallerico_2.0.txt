The Killer and the Man Who Couldnt Be Killed.
  Negative
The basic set-up for the Aussie thriller The Suicide Theory could have been that of an episode of The Twilight Zone, or any number or horrendous  Quentin Tarantino knock-offs that tried to sell audiences on philosophical hitmen in suits in the late s. Ill admit to some serious apprehension given my general dislike of both twist-heavy Serling knock-offs and screenwriters who dont realize how difficult it is to do what QT does.
  Negative
So I'm happy to report that, for an hour or so, The Suicide Theory is surprisingly strong.
  Positive
Carried by an engaging lead performance and witty dialogue that can reference Candide and Sunset Blvd. without seeming overly forced, the movie works.
  Positive
Until it doesnt.
  Neutral
The final Act OTwists, which almost anyone will see coming from very far away, lets down the character work that preceded it and the whole piece sinks just a bit too far into the melodramatic muck from which its characters are trying to extricate themselves.
  Very negative
Steven the excellent  Steve Mouzakis is a brutal, unapologetic hitman, the kind who leaves no witnesses and murders a man in the opening scene because he interrupted a conversation he was having.
  Negative
Steven is hired by the meek Percival  Leon Cain, a man with unusual scars on his face and an even more unusual story.
  Negative
Percival wants to die but he cant kill himself.
  Negative
Every time he tries, he wakes up in a hospital and theres a clever, Coen-esque running joke in which the same doctor says Youre lucky to be alive.
  Negative
Hes even convinced that Steven cant just ice him like he does his other targets.
  Negative
After an opening discussion on a train, Steven shoots Percival three times at close range.
  Positive
Percival lives.
  Neutral
Not long after, he shoots him again, in the head, taking out his eye.
  Negative
Percival lives.
  Neutral
Percival tells Steven that he can only kill him when Percival really doesnt want to die.
  Negative
Percival did something wrong and the powers that be wont let him take the easy way out.
  Negative
So Steven and Percival form a unique relationship the killer and the guy who wants to be killed.
  Positive
The problem is that Steven doesnt really want to be a killer any more.
  Negative
Hes really only in the business because of the emotional baggage he carries after the hit and run accident that killed the only woman he ever cared about.
  Negative
Similarly, Percival might have more to live for if his boyfriend Chris hadnt been killed.
  Negative
These are two men at opposite ends of the spectrum socially, sexually, culturally, who, of course, learn they have more in common than they originally thought.
  Negative
And that fate may have actually brought them together for a reason.
  Positive
There are signs of clichd filmmaking from the beginning in the flat close-ups and over-used score, but the performances carry Suicide Theory for a surprisingly long time.
  Negative
I wouldnt be stunned at all to see Mouzakis pop up more and more in bigger parts.
  Positive
Hes engaging in a way that makes a loathsome character like Steven possible to watch.
  Neutral
This can be a strikingly ugly, scuzzy film, such as in a pair of scenes near the end of the first act in which Steven has a one-night stand that ends in near-strangulation and Percival is the victim of a hate crime.
  Very negative
And yet Mouzakis performance and director  Dru Browns filmmaking keep the piece from turning off viewers in a way that it cant win them back.
  Negative
Just as The Suicide Theory is becoming an interesting meditation on fate vs. free will, it reaches a final act thats really just a mess.
  Negative
While the film probably wouldnt exist without its final twists, I would argue that it would be a much stronger film without them.
  Negative
Using the arc of a hitmans redemption to comment on fate given that murder is the ultimate theft of free will works without the Twilight Zone hook.
  Negative
The result, like so many attempts Percival takes on his own life, is a near-miss.
  Negative
