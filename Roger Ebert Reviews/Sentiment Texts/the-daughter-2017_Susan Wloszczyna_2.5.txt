"The Daughter" comes bearing literary cred as a loose adaptation of Ibsens  play The Wild Duck.
  Negative
It trades in a Norwegian backdrop for an economically bereft rural village in modern-day Australia while retaining the class-conscious premise of a family rocked by the revelation of long-held secrets and lies as it pits the privileged few against the depressed working class.
  Negative
There is still a duck, one that symbolically gets injured thanks to the none-too-sharp shooting skills of Henry  Geoffrey Rush, emitting varying degrees of aloofness, a wealthy owner of a century-old lumber mill that is on the verge of shutting down while fleeing residents seek work elsewhere.
  Negative
Meanwhile, the damaged fowl struggles to recover.
  Negative
And, soon, human creatures that have been harmed by Henrys undue past carelessness will be fighting in their own lives as well.
  Negative
What is one to do when you take away a whole towns livelihood?
  Neutral
Put on a lavish party, of course.
  Positive
Henry is the type who likes to throw money at problems and he is sparing little expense as he is about to turn his slinky housekeeper into wife No.
  Negative
, much to the chagrin of Christian  Paul Schneider, the lone Yank in the cast, his adult prodigal son who returns home from the States to be best man.
  Positive
With his own marital situation collapsing, the last thing he wants to do is witness his father marrying a woman half his age especially since his own mother was driven to suicide.
  Negative
A reunion with happy-go-lucky school chum Oliver  Ewen Leslie, an ingratiating presence who radiates a cool-dad likability starts off warmly until Christian sees how content he is with devoted wife Charlotte  Miranda Otto, adoring teen daughter Hedvig  Odessa Young, a vivacious beauty with lilac-infused blunt cut hair and his scatter-brained yet insightful father Walter  Sam Neill, subdued yet rock solid.
  Neutral
Not even the fact that he is among those who lost their job at the mill can keep him down.
  Negative
Turns out, Christian is a recovering alcoholic given to violent and irrational outbursts when he goes on a bender.
  Negative
And the bottle soon beckons as it becomes clear he blames Henry for his mothers demise especially when he hears that Charlotte was once his fathers housekeeper, too.
  Negative
That leads him to surmise the truth about a duplicitous situation while transforming into a malevolent bearer of bad news in the name of honesty, dead set on making all and sundry as miserable as he is.
  Negative
If you are getting the feeling that there are some sudsy operatic goings-on in director  Simon Stones movie debut, inspired by his stage adaptation of the play, you wouldnt be wrong.
  Negative
Not that he doesnt try to camouflage the melodramatic soap with ominous outdoor landscapes with towering tree trunks and dark gray billows of clouds gathering on the horizon.
  Negative
He also makes good use of a cavernous warehouse space populated with the decaying shells of cars where Hedvig and her young swain go to make out.
  Positive
To add a modern edge, Stone and his editor are big on a weird time-shifting technique, first showing a space devoid of actors as we hear dialogue being spoken and then quickly cutting to the actual scene.
  Negative
The off-kilter handheld camerawork frequently chases after the figures as they move about.
  Negative
But there is no disguising that there's much more talk than action in The Daughter.
  Negative
At least Stone has collected an impressive cast who will keep you watching even when emotions lean toward the histrionic.
  Positive
Schneider might have the thankless duty of being the catalyst.
  Neutral
But he is also the weak link, lacking in subtlety and given few redeeming qualities as he grows ever more determined to unleash emotional chaos like a vengeful and increasingly stubbly werewolf.
  Negative
He is supposed to be an outcast but he feels adrift in the movie as well.
  Negative
We spend too little time with the even-keel Christian at the beginning before he takes a turn for the worst to care much about him.
  Negative
But it is Young, a vibrantly natural presence who convincingly teeters between knowing rebel and vulnerable innocent, who captures our full attention.
  Very positive
The Daughter ends just as it begins with the sound of gunfire.
  Negative
The duck, alas, is allowed to escape relatively unscathed.
  Negative
The people on the screen, not so much.
  Neutral
But somehow what comes close to dissolving into heartbreaking tragedy instead offers the merest whiff of hope for the future.
  Neutral
As Neills seen-it-all Walter says when all hell begins to break loose, Everyones got a story like this  its as old as the hills.
  Negative
If only said tale were told with a bit more consistency.
  Negative
