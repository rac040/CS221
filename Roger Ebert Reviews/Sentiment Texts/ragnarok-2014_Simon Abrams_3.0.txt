A sleepy, but pleasantly surprising action-adventure,  "Ragnarok" is the rare Spielberg clone that feels like it was made by  people that not only know what they like about Spielberg's films, but  are capable of evoking them.
  Positive
Sigurd Pal Sverre  Hagen, a head-in-the-clouds archaeologist that gets terrorized by a  giant snake monster while looking for Viking artifacts, is a cross  between Indiana Jones and Dr. Alan Grant.
  Negative
Which is to say: he's a  benignly egocentric single dad that realizes by the film's end that  knowledge should be shared, not monetized, and women and children aren't  accessories.
  Negative
Sigurd's quest grants him genuine perspective, and makes  him realize that he's not that different from his miserly boss,  head-strong subjects, or serpentine tormentor.
  Neutral
These revelations  modestly unfold at their own leisurely pace, and are supplemented by  some modestly impressive brick-and-mortar action filmmaking,  particularly good use of slow-motion photography, and an exciting  zipline set piece.
  Positive
"Ragnarok" could stand to be a little less timid, but  it also handily proves that you don't need to be bombastic to be  exciting.
  Positive
"Ragnarok" begins with a weary, perfunctory preface: in  the th century, a bunch of fool-hardy Vikings set out to test their  mettle.
  Negative
They wind up getting attacked by a giant snake.
  Negative
The snake  doesn't really get to mess anybody up, and the Vikings are only shown  skulking around for a bit.
  Very negative
Which sucks, since this placeholder intro is  supposed to hold viewers over for an hour, when we get the film's first  major action scene.
  Negative
Then again, that shortcoming isn't such a bad thing  when you consider how effectively the film's characters and concerns are  established an hour in.
  Neutral
It's easy to forgive "Ragnarok"'s creators for  what they overlooked given the little, personal touches thrown in.
  Neutral
When  we first meet Sigurd, a widower with two kids, he only has eyes for his  job.
  Negative
He's obsessed with some recently uncovered runes, but the  money-men that pay for his research aren't impressed with his passion  and theoretical knowledge.
  Negative
So Sigurd teams up with fellow archaeologist  Allan  Nicolai Cleve Broch and research assistant Elisabeth Sofia  Helin, and drags his kids to Finmark, the Northern-most part of Denmark,  in search of grant-worthy booty.
  Negative
Here's  where "Ragnarok" proves that its creators get how crucial  characterization is to the success of Spielberg fantasies like "Jurassic  Park" and "Close Encounters of the Third Kind."
  Neutral
Neither Sigurd  nor Elisabeth need to go through the ringer to prove that they're  scatterbrained problem-solvers that can also empathize enough to care  for children.
  Negative
It's not an eitheror deal.
  Negative
Elisabeth puts a fine  point on that notion when she smiles and tells Sigurd's daughter  Ragnhild Maria Annette Tandero Berglyd that "Family is not really my  thing."
  Neutral
Then she smiles warmly after Ragnhild tells her of her mother's  passing, and spreads bug spray on the girl's face.
  Negative
It's a touching,  small moment that rings true thanks to Berglyd and Helin's apparent  chemistry.
  Positive
It also goes a  long way towards revealing the film's unsentimental priorities,  particularly the film's adoration for Sigurd, and his habit of figuring  out his priorities as he messes them up.
  Negative
Sigurd's usually too enamored  with his research to see beyond himself, but viewers can tell where his  heart is in a slow-motion sequence where he pulls son Brage Julian  Podolski away from danger.
  Negative
Svendsen's stare shows that he's both angry  and terrified.
  Negative
His bulging eyes are blocked just right, drawing  attention away from his mouth.
  Positive
It's a really good, finely observed  moment that could have easily been forgettable, and by-the-numbers.
  Positive
You  can also see why "Ragnarok" roots for Sigurd in the scene where Svendsen  emerges from a dark tunnel armed only with a snake egg and a torch.
  Negative
Svendsen's too wiry and unkempt to be a Scandinavian Indiana Jones, but  he looks almost as heroic.
  Negative
It's a beautiful, front-lit shot that draws  out the shimmering inky darkness at the actor's back.
  Positive
The camera doesn't  linger on Svendsen, but that image stays with you.
  Positive
By  now, even I'm convinced I'm talking "Ragnarok" up too much.
  Negative
It is a fun  genre film with subtle power that really captures the imagination, though  you've seen this story many times before, and have heard it told in far  better ways.
  Very positive
It's rote in some ways, and takes too damn long to get to  some really good stuff, but when I set out to write this review, I found  myself immediately drawn to its best bits.
  Positive
The film's highs really do  make the lows seem insignificant.
  Positive
I hope more people check out  "Ragnarok" for that reason alone.
  Neutral
