Here is the sad and frustrating irony of The Theory of Everything: its a biopic about one of the most brilliant people in the history of the planet, the renowned astrophysicist Stephen Hawking  a man famous for thinking in boldly innovative ways  yet his story is told in the safest and most conventional method imaginable.
  Positive
This is ironic given the director:  James Marsh, an Academy Award winner for the  documentary Man on Wire, which was so thrilling and so clever in its narrative structure that it made you leave the theater feeling as if youd actually witnessed Philippe Petit walking across a tightrope between the World Trade Center Towers.
  Positive
You didnt  the film features photographs and reenactments but no film footage of Petit pulling off his daredevil stunt.
  Negative
Thats how persuasive Marsh can be.
  Positive
Here, hes made a strongly acted, handsomely crafted film that nonetheless feels bland and unsatisfying.
  Negative
It falls into the trap that so many biopics do: It hits all the key moments in the life of the author of  A Brief History of Time and skims the surface of a complicated existence without digging deeper, without taking chances.
  Negative
Everyone involved does everything they should, and the result is just sort of  fine.
  Negative
Of course, Hawkings story is inspiring  the way hes battled motor neuron disease over the past  years and defied the odds not only to survive, but thrive.
  Negative
And in playing Hawking, Eddie Redmayne more than rises to the challenge of portraying the man's gradual physical deterioration but also conveying the spark of mental acuity that has remained, and marked all of Hawkings important work.
  Negative
Nothing the -year-old actor has done previously Les Miserables, My Week With Marilyn suggested he had this sort of complexity in him.
  Negative
Its an impressive performance, so much so that it makes you wish it were in the service of stronger material.
  Positive
The Theory of Everything comes from screenwriter  Anthony McCarten, based on Travelling to Infinity: My Life With Stephen, the memoir by Hawkings first wife, Jane.
  Negative
A general feeling of tastefulness permeates the proceedings, as if everyone wanted to be overly respectful toward these people, and their life, and the access they provided, at the expense of revelations that might have seemed inappropriate or startling or, heaven forbid, thought-provoking.
  Positive
The love and support we see from Jane Hawking are tireless' as portrayed by a fresh-faced  Felicity Jones, Jane is a woman of both grace and strength.
  Very positive
And what she went through in taking care of him while raising their three children and trying to focus on her own intellectual pursuits must have been exhausting, and often discouraging.
  Negative
It must have threatened to swallow her whole.
  Neutral
We see very little of that here.
  Negative
This Jane is a saint.
  Neutral
But the early scenes between Redmayne and Jones positively crackle.
  Positive
Theres an instant connection when they spy each other across a crowded room at a party at Cambridge in .
  Neutral
Hes fumbling and funny, shes pretty and perky.
  Positive
Hes studying cosmology, shes studying medieval Spanish poetry.
  Negative
Hes an atheist, shes a devout follower of the Church of England.
  Negative
But theyre mutually curious and seem to bring out the best in one another.
  Positive
Their preliminary days include a romantic scene involving the little-known properties of Tide laundry detergent.
  Negative
Everything seems possible for these two young and brilliant minds, until Hawking experiences a series of increasingly clumsy moments, followed by a serious spill on the campus courtyard.
  Negative
Then comes the diagnosis at age  that he has motor neuron disease, or ALS, better known as Lou Gehrigs disease.
  Neutral
The doctor also gives him just two years to live.
  Positive
Hawking tries to withdraw but Jane wont have it' she forces her way into his life and insists shes ready for whatever comes their way.
  Neutral
They quickly marry, and eventually have three children.
  Negative
But as Stephens body weakens and the family has to make continual adjustments to his physical status  including the famous computerized voice he creates when he no longer can speak, which is the source of some of the films precious few laughs  his mind stays sharp.
  Very positive
He continues his pursuit of the one simple, elegant equation that will explain everything in the universe.
  Positive
And it should be noted that The Theory of Everything is one of three films opening this week in which black holes figure prominently, alongside  Interstellar and  Big Hero .
  Negative
Not unlike our own dear  Roger Ebert, Hawkings mind became even more expansive and powerful once he began losing his physical abilities.
  Negative
Eventually, The Theory of Everything reaches a point where it toys with a challenging notion: the possibility that Jane and Hawking each had dalliances on the side with the others tacit approval, once it became clear that their marriage had changed irreparably.
  Negative
Jane sought solace with Jonathan Hellyer Jones  Charlie Cox, the hunky, widowed choir director with big, brown puppy-dog eyes who served as Hawkings caretaker, and the familys de facto husband and father figure.
  Negative
Hawking later had the pleasure of spending time with the beautiful and vibrant therapist Elaine a charismatic  Maxine Peake, who flirted with Stephen and even leafed through the pages of a Penthouse magazine for his perusal.
  Positive
But the film glosses over these extra-marital relationships and their resolution with little muss, fuss, or emotional distress.
  Negative
It tiptoes toward the fire and then scurries back.
  Negative
Its unfortunately an apt metaphor for the film as a whole.
  Negative
