"Narcissus, at high tide, escaped without wings."
  Positive
Those are the final words of th century Cuban poet Jose Lezama Lima's "Muerta de Narciso," a poem excerpted throughout "Sin Alas," writerdirector  Ben Chace's impressive feature debut.
  Very positive
The first American film to be shot in Cuba since , "Sin Alas" is about memories and dreams, flashbacks and continuums, fragmented timelines and piled-up detritus.
  Negative
It's about the way light looks in Havana in the morning, the way echoes carry through doorways, the way the surf crashes over the sea wall.
  Negative
It's about rambunctious street life, music and voices and eccentric characters, playing out against the backdrop of gorgeous crumbling pre-Revolution buildings, all of which still have stories to tell, messages to pass on.
  Positive
"Sin Alas" has a lot going on, both plot-wise and stylistically, and it often gets quite theatrical, but the overall effectis that of a pure and beautiful simplicity.
  Positive
There is nothing in the way between the story and its impact.
  Negative
Luis Vargas Carlos Padrn, a -year-old former arts journalist, opens the newspaper one morning and sees an obituary for a once-famous dancer, Isabela Munoz  Yulisleyvs Rodrigues.
  Negative
Back in , Luis and Isabella had a brief but very intense affair.
  Positive
News of her death stirs the depths of his soul, memories all fragmented and hallucinatory crowding before his eyes.
  Negative
He has been dreaming of Isabela, the same dream every night, and in the dream, a song is playing.
  Negative
He does not know what the song is and he tells his friend Ovilio  Mario Limonta about it.
  Negative
The two friends set out on a quest to find out the name of the song.
  Negative
This musical motif, composed by Robert Pycior, recurs throughout "Sin Alas," sometimes played with mournful cellos, sometimes with pounding bongos underneath, sometimes with single piano notes sounding like a child's music box.
  Negative
Music is not used in "Sin Alas" as lazy filler or to manipulate audience emotions.
  Negative
The music is sweepingly dramatic: it's an old-fashioned score.
  Positive
"I need to get this melody out of my head so I can rest," says Luis to Ovilio.
  Negative
That quest leads him down pathways of memory that he might have wished to avoid, but once the floodgates open, there's no stopping it.
  Negative
Luis grew up in a wealthy family of sugar-planters, and his parents fled Cuba when Castro took over.
  Positive
He, a young man of , stayed behind.
  Positive
There are mysteries in his childhood, things glimpsed when he was a boy, not understood.
  Neutral
Ben Chace and his cinematographer,  Sean Price Williams, have chosen to use different color schemes for each separate era.
  Negative
This might sound cliche, but it isn't in execution.
  Negative
The color schemes are threads through the labyrinth of associations, locating the different spots on the timeline as they come in and out of focus.
  Negative
Luis' childhood is in crisp, almost alienating black-and-white, sunlight bursting through the frame, bringing not clarity but dizzying reflections and refractions.
  Positive
This is no golden-hued nostalgic past.
  Negative
This is something else entirely.
  Neutral
Luis and Isabela's  affair with Lieter Ledesma Alberto as the younger Luis has a glamorous s palette, all sea-greens and silvers and pinks, passionate and yet somewhat cold, torrential rain pouring on the windshield, Isabella's silvery nail polish gleaming against a cut-glass tumbler.
  Negative
The paranoia of Castro's Cuba is intense in the s sequences, and the style reflects that reality.
  Positive
In the current day, life on the street may be more relaxed, but that paranoia remains: open doorways, labyrinthine stairwells, windows peering down on the residents from above.
  Negative
In " Listen Up Philip," " Christmas, Again," " Heaven Knows What," " Queen of Earth," and now "Sin Alas," Sean Price Williams shows he is one of the most gifted cinematographers working today.
  Positive
He's wonderful with fluid camera movements and intuitive closeups.
  Positive
He can "catch" a mood, or a typeof light, or the space between people, in a way that tells  of the story.
  Positive
The current-day Havana-street scenes in "Sin Alas" have a lot in common with the street photography of "Heaven Knows What," Williams' camera seeming to be everywhere at the same time, not missing a beat.
  Neutral
But the flashbacks and dream sequences in "Sin Alas" are surreal and eerie, with elongated shadows stretching across rooms or up gigantic empty marble stairways.
  Negative
Along with the score, Williams' work brings out the depth of Chace's story, its potentials, its universality.
  Negative
This is not a "slice of life" movie.
  Negative
It's a "meditation on life" movie.
  Positive
"Sin Alas" is emotional and dense, thought-provoking and intelligent, and it's all held together by music, Lima's poem, colors, sounds.
  Very positive
Ingmar Bergman "Wild Strawberries," in particular is a clear influence on "Sin Alas": dreams bleeding into waking life, the past flowing into the present, as an old man close to death goes on a "journey," coming to accept the liquidity of time and his own mortality.
  Negative
The past doesn't just contain the story of "what happened," the past also holds Luis' various younger selves, and all of the once-vibrant people he used to know, people now dead and gone.
  Negative
Narcissus, at high tide, escaped without wings.In Spanish, "without wings" translates to "sin alas," and throughout this beautiful film, characters try to fly with clipped wings, develop wings they never knew they had, or accept the fact that the time for "escape" is long past.
  Negative
However bleak this may sound, "Sin Alas" is not about hopeless people living hopeless lives.
  Negative
Everybody wants something, and everybody tries to get what they want.
  Positive
Life is vibrant and sad, tough and poetic, lonely and claustrophobic, simultaneously.
  Positive
The past has been severed from the present, with a sense of dislocation the result.
  Positive
Time is speeding up, and at points, it is as though everyone is waking up from a dream.
  Negative
Nobody knows which way things will go.
  Positive
