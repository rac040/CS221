Bertrand Taverniers My Through Journey Through French Cinema, like the two  Martin Scorsese first-person docs that obviously inspired it, Personal Journey Through American Cinema and My Voyage to Italian Cinema, isnt about the filmmakers own career but about the cinephilia that preceded and influenced it.
  Negative
As such, the three-hour memoirmeditations natural home would be the French equivalent of PBS.
  Negative
In foreign contexts, the film is somewhat more anomalous.
  Negative
Had Tavernier been crafting it for American art houses, he would have been well-advised to shape a two-hour version.
  Negative
He might have also have been wise to start out with the part of French cinema that still excites foreign viewers most, the era of the New Wave.
  Positive
That brilliant artistic moment does finally make an appearance, in hour three, but its after two hours spent exploring the years -, which will be far less familiar to non-French viewers.
  Negative
The movie, then, is not just a niche film but a film for a niche of a niche.
  Negative
Rather than being ideal for people who know a bit about French cinema and want to know more, its best suited to people who know a considerable amount about French cinema and culture of the early sound era and want to delve deeper.
  Negative
In a way, its the cinematic equivalent of  Franois Truffauts intoxicating book The Films in My Life,though that comparison may not be entirely to the benefit of Taverniers work.
  Negative
Imagining the same work executed by Truffaut, its easy to envision a consummately witty, charming and illuminating film, one that would sweep the viewer along on a tide of cinematic rapture and insight.
  Positive
The Tavernier version, by contrast, is sober, sincere and professorial rather than deeply exciting or revelatory.
  Positive
World War II is the devastating event that looms over Taverniers entire chronicle, reaching from out from the s well into the s. Starting out in memoir mode, the filmmaker recalls being a three-year-old in Lyon when Liberation came, announced by lights that he would forever after associate with splendors of cinema.
  Negative
His earliest memory of movies is of the flashing lights of a car and motorcycle as they sped along a mountain road in a gangster film.
  Negative
Recalling the scene years later, Tavernier realized the movie was by Jacques Becker, a favorite director who dominates the first hour of My Journey Through French Cinema.
  Positive
Calling him the most American of French directors a compliment that wouldnt be regarded as such in other eras Tavernier praises Becker for his eye-level viewpoint, his distrust of plot and empathy for his characters, especially the central place he gave women.
  Negative
Using clips from Beckers best known films, Casque dOr, Le Trou and  Touchez Pas au Grisbi which he salutes because it wasnt like American gangster films, Tavernier provides an insightful tribute to the visual eloquence and originality of his first artistic hero, whose death at  in  was a great loss to French cinema.
  Positive
The next artistic heavyweight considered is  Jean Renoir, but theres a catch.
  Neutral
While Tavernier recalls the shock of encountering the brilliance of The Grand Illusion, and recognizes both its dazzling stylistic expressiveness and political daring it was banned by the Nazis, he ultimately deems Renoir politically undesirable.
  Negative
Though the elder director was a man of the left, as his Popular Front-oriented films of the s attest, he evidently was not leftist enough for Tavernier, a one-time Communist.
  Negative
While this reviewer doesnt have the expertise to evaluate such charges, Tavernier passes along the inflammatory accusation that Renoir moved to America in  to convince the U.S. that the Petain government was good for France, and the view that it was disgraceful for the son of Pierre Auguste Renoir to become a naturalized American citizen.
  Neutral
However cranky and tinged with ancient political hostilities, the films reflections on Renoir lead naturally into a consideration of the great French screen star  Jean Gabin.
  Positive
In the s, Tavernier aptly notes, the young and brawny Gabin was the ideal working class hero: a veritable poster boy for the Popular Front.
  Positive
Though, like Renoir, he decamped to Hollywood during World War II, he bought his contract back from Universal in order to return and fight.
  Negative
Returning to the screen thereafter, Gabin had lost the youthful dash that we still associate with his iconic image, but Tavernier makes a good case for the richness and skill of his post-WWII work.
  Positive
Turning to the work of Marcel Carn, still a divisive figure in the world of French cinema, Tavernier delivers one of most detailed disquisitions on technique and style, noting for instance that Carn almost always used a mm lens.
  Positive
Illustrating his comments with entrancing passages from films like Port of Shadows and Le Jour Se Lve, he says, Every shot energizes the narrative.
  Negative
No two are alike.
  Negative
All the same, Tavernier says the visually gifted director couldnt write a line and he credits the spirit of generosity in his films to screenwriter Jacques Prvert.
  Positive
Following a tribute to the importance of music in films and the work of composers Maurice Jaubert and Joseph Kosma, Tavernier allows us a peak into the cinematic revolution of the s via his work as a press agent for producer Georges de Beauregard, who launched the New Wave with Breathless.
  Positive
While giving us portraits of cineastes including  Agns Varda and  Claude Chabrol, Tavernier recalls working as a publicist on  Contempt and other films by  Jean-Luc Godard, an inveterate iconoclast who said he didnt want to meet critics whod praised his work, only those whod panned it.
  Negative
Prior to working with de Beauregard, Tavernier found his way into the world of filmmaking as an assistant to director  Jean-Pierre Melville, who joins Becker as the twin titans in his personal pantheon.
  Positive
The section on Melville, a difficult character as well as a great inspiration, is easily the most engaging part of this films second half.
  Positive
The glimpses that Tavernier provides of such icy crime dramas as  Le Doulos supposedly  Quentin Tarantinos favorite movie, Le Samoura and  Le Cercle Rouge left this viewer eager to return to Melvilles work.
  Negative
Thats perhaps the best reaction a work of earnest cinephilia like My Journey Through French Cinema can provoke.
  Positive
