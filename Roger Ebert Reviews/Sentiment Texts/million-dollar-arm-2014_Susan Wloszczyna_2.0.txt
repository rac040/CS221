The trouble with "Million Dollar Arm" is not limited to its title, which suggests a cheesy horror thriller about an overpriced artificial appendage that is coming to get you.
  Negative
This supposedly uplifting true-life baseball tale never quite strikes the necessary emotional sweet spots that these types of inspirational sports movies shamelessly if effectively milk, despite a pitch with great potential: Opportunistic sports agent out to save his struggling company attempts to sniff out untapped baseball talent in far-off India by staging a reality TV-show contest.
  Negative
The plot suggests an intriguing triple play that combines the outside-of-box thinking of " Moneyball," the can-do gumption of " Jerry Maguire" and the mass-of-humanity chaos of " Slumdog Millionaire" underscored with music by the Oscar-winning A.R. Rahman.
  Negative
And for about half the movie, it almost succeeds.
  Positive
But there is a gaping hole where "Million Dollar Arm"s heart should be that widens to crater-size in the second half.
  Negative
And that hole is named JB Bernstein  Jon Hamm, a self-centered, arrogant serial model-dater who exhibits a near-sociopathic lack of concern for the welfare of others.
  Negative
For some reason, we are asked to cheer for this exploiter of two sheltered teen athletes as he drags them from their small Indian villages, flies them to Los Angeles and then expects them to sit around his coldly contemporary high-priced bachelor pad in between training sessions for a major league tryout.
  Negative
They dont speak English.
  Neutral
They know next to nothing about the game they are supposed to be playing at professional levels.
  Negative
They dont even know how elevators work.
  Negative
Yet they remain steadfastly loyal to Mr. JB, Sir, a man who does little to help them to overcome their culture shock and homesickness save for tossing them a couple of power bars for breakfast every day.
  Negative
By all rights, this movie should belong to Bernsteins discoveries, the inscrutable Dinesh  Madhur Mittal, who was  Dev Patels criminal brother in "Slumdog" and outgoing Rinku  Suraj Sharma, the star of " Life of Pi".
  Negative
If the audience is pulling for anyone, it is these two brave strangers in a strange land.
  Positive
Although the  sports drama " Sugar" already explored this fertile ground in its story of a Dominican baseball player, it still would be a more enriching account.
  Negative
At least with his just-so jaw stubble and shark-like smile, Jon Hamm keeps us watching initially as he steps up to the plate and makes his case for a post-"Mad Men" career as a leading man on the big screen.
  Positive
In a way, it helps that his Bernstein is cut from the same smooth-talking seductive cloth as his ad whiz Don Draper.
  Negative
I didnt even mind the incredibly corny a-ha moment when Bernstein, feeling defeated after losing a major client, mindlessly flips through TV channels.
  Negative
He suddenly spies  Susan Boyle performing her astonishing rendition of "I Dreamed a Dream" on "Britains Got Talent" before switching over to a channel showing a cricket match.
  Negative
A couple back and forths with the remote, and he concocts the idea of inviting young Indian players to compete for a chance to become the next great MLB pitcher.
  Positive
Just ignore the fact that Boyles  performance aired a year after the "Million Dollar Arm" contest first came into being.
  Negative
Screenwriter  Tom McCarthy whose previous storytelling efforts such as " Win Win" and " The Visitor" were several steps above what he serves up here certainly did.
  Positive
The scenic trip to Mumbai and beyond that follows, including auditions right next to the  Taj Mahal, proves diverting enough to mask most of Bernsteins severest character flaws.
  Negative
Its only when he is back home that he becomes nearly impossible to tolerate until an implausible though entirely predictable third-act conversion suddenly has him turning into a patriarchal Mr. Sensitive.
  Negative
It isnt exactly a good sign that scene-stealer first class  Alan Arkin grouchily naps through most of his early scenes as baseball scout Ray Poitevint, who assists with finding the fresh recruits.
  Negative
Still, a snoozing Arkin is better than most awake actors, and Poitevints ability to hear how fast a pitch is thrown turns into one of "Million Dollar Arm"s better shticks.
  Negative
Besides Arkin, the ever-reliable  Bill Paxton shows up as Tom House, a rule-breaking Zen master of a coach.
  Negative
Asif Mandvi of "The Daily Show" plays Aash, the practical yin to Bernsteins pie-in-the-sky yang as his American business partner of Indian descent.
  Negative
Pocket-size Bollywood star Pitobash is baseball fanatic Amit, who basically volunteers to be Bernsteins unpaid intern, manages to not overdo the cute factor in what would have been called a "Bronson Pinchot Role" a couple decades ago.
  Negative
And, most importantly, there is  Lake Bell, whose warm and inviting presence provides a much-needed female counter balance as Bernsteins lissome med-student tenant next door.
  Positive
What is the final score for "Million Dollar Arm"?
  Neutral
It may earn a few runs early in the game, but is far from a satisfying grand slam of family entertainment.
  Positive
