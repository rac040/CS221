"The Dawn Patrol" is a stirring anti-war drama about the futility of battle set among a squadron of fighter pilots during World War I that has been done a couple of times the  version was directed by the great  Howard Hawks and featured Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Richard Barthelmass in the leads while the  remake was helmed by Edmund Goulding and included a cast led by Errol Flynn, Basil Rathbone and  David Niven.
  Positive
Although the  version is better known, both takes are interesting the Hawks version allows one to see him playing with ideas that he would come back to again throughout his career.
  Positive
Sadly, the similarly titled "Dawn Patrol" is an odious stew of murder, revenge, casual racism and overt misogyny that is all the worse because of its apparent celebration of those ingredients.
  Negative
Scott Eastwood, last seen showing his pecs in " The Longest Ride," stars as a Marine named John.
  Negative
As the story opens, he is being marched across a desert at gunpoint while telling his attacker the story of how he wound up in this particular position.
  Negative
In the summer of , he was an ordinary surf bum content to ride the waves off of Venice Beach with his brother, surfing ace Ben Chris Brochu, and dad Trick  Jeff Fahey while fighting off the Mexicans who dare to intrude their turf.
  Negative
Tensions are exacerbated when Ben's ex-girlfriend, Donna Kim Matula, takes up with Miguel Gabriel DeSanti, and he responds by drunkenly grabbing her away from Miguel and carting her down to the shoreline for what begins as a sexual assault and ends with a marriage proposal, while John smacks around Miguel a couple of times in the most low-key and apologetic manner possible.
  Negative
Sure, this might leave you to think that Ben is a drunken jerk with rage issues but you would be wrong he just wants to surf without having to deal with the surferazzi yes, this is a term used in the film or his pothead mother  Rita Wilson who want to exploit his talents for money.
  Very negative
Alas, not everyone is on his level of enlightenment because a couple of days later, he is found murdered on the beach.
  Neutral
John is convinced that Miguel is responsible for the killing he even saw the guy's car in the area just before finding the body but when the police are unable to prove it or to even come up with his last name, John's grieving parents essentially demand that he "man up" and take matters into his own hands.
  Negative
After putting up what barely qualifies as token resistance, he goes about doing just that and, in news that will shock few of you, it all goes sideways from there.
  Negative
"Dawn Patrol" is so rotten in so many ways that there is a temptation to look at it at first as some kind of demented deadpan spoof of films that celebrate grotesque macho codes above all else, and it is only with a gradual sense of horror that it becomes apparent that not only are we meant to take it seriously but that it thinks that it is saying something profound.
  Very negative
The screenplay by  Rachel Long amp'  Brian Pittman is nothing more than a bunch of stupid incidents that make little sense, lead to a pathetically obvious surprise revelation and are presented via a flashback frame that is borderline torturous at times without adding anything of value to the proceedings.
  Negative
Suffice it to say, director  Daniel Petrie Jr. fails to lend the material the sort of lan or quiet dignity that he brought to such previous efforts as " Toy Soldiers" and "In the Army Now."
  Negative
The casual racism and sexism on display is oftentimes appalling, especially since the attitude it displays towards them suggests at least a tacit endorsement.
  Negative
The characterization of Donna as a vapid and frequently topless tramp who exists solely as a sexual receptacle is particularly gruesome, all the more so considering that the screenplay was co-written by a woman.
  Negative
There is not a single character in it that any sensible person would want to spend even the slightest amount of time with and none of the actors are able to make them into anything either.
  Very negative
Eastwood basically does the same thing he did in "The Longest Ride" stare vacantly while shirtless and his performance is the highlight.
  Negative
Look, if you want to see a film that serves as a cautionary tale about how the single-minded desire for revenge can have unexpected repercussions for everyone involved and utilizes smart writing, whip-smart direction, strong performances and a nice sense of irony, I have the perfect movie for you.
  Positive
It is "Wild Tales," the jaw-dropping Argentinian black comedy consisting of several vignettes involving people trying to get the best of those who have done them wrong.
  Positive
By comparison, "Dawn Patrol" should prove to be as welcome at the multiplex as washed-up medical waste is to a day at the beach.
  Negative
