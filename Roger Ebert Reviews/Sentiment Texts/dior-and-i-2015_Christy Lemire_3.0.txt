Its actually a wonder that  Raf Simons agreed to be the subject of the documentary Dior and I in the first place.
  Positive
The Belgian fashion designer, who had just taken over in  as creative director at the venerated house of Christian Dior, was tasked with putting together his first-ever haute couture show in just eight weeks, an enormous undertaking which usually requires five or six months.
  Negative
But Simons shies from the spotlight under ordinary circumstances.
  Negative
He is no  Karl Lagerfeld  nor is he John Galliano, whom he replaced after Galliano was arrested and dismissed for an anti-Semitic tirade a year earlier.
  Negative
When the big day finally comes to display his debut collection, Simons has no interest in stepping out before the glittering, admiring crowd to bask in the customary applause, and you can feel him squirming as hes forced to be photographed alongside movie stars like  Marion Cotillard and  Sharon Stone on the red carpet.
  Very negative
Where he is comfortable - and where his vision and authority are quite clear  is behind the scenes.
  Positive
And thats where French filmmaker  Frederic Tcheng spends the majority of time in his eye-opening, solo directing debut.
  Negative
He previously co-directed the fashion documentary Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has to Travel.
  Negative
Regardless of your own sartorial savoir faire, youll walk away from Tchengs film with massive appreciation for the amount of work that goes into making something look elegant.
  Positive
Dior and I refers to the connection between the -year-old Simons and the late, master designer, which the film reveals through narrated segments from his  memoir, Christian Dior amp' I.
  Negative
The parallels are many.
  Neutral
Both men share a preference for the quiet company of a few trusted friends.
  Positive
Both ponder their outward persona versus their true selves.
  Positive
Both fret about dealing with the press.
  Neutral
But the title also could be interpreted as the connection between the longtime employees of the house and their departed master, whose ghost they swear lurks in the hallways and workrooms.
  Negative
Tcheng illustrates this notion through artful, haunting nighttime imagery.
  Positive
These veteran seamstresses and craftsmen, some of whom have worked for Dior for  years, feel a dedication to perpetuating his legacy and an emotional bond with the products they create.
  Positive
Tcheng gets a little inside baseball at times, but he also manages in quick, graceful ways to explain why certain elements matter to the layperson.
  Positive
Longtime fashion writer Cathy Horyn, then with The New York Times, describes how Raf wasnt the obvious candidate because hed been known primarily for menswear and a minimalist aesthetic through his previous work with the German fashion line Jil Sander.
  Negative
The Dior look, meanwhile, is all about femininity, romance and a shapely silhouette.
  Positive
Simons challenge was to honor the traditions of the influential house but also implement his own ideas and designs to provide a modern edge, and to achieve it within the high-dollar, high-profile realm of haute couture.
  Positive
Dior and I intimately demonstrates the tricky balance between art and commerce, between perpetuating a mythology while attending to the bottom line, and doing it with the pressure of a ticking clock.
  Negative
As one of Simons top lieutenants, do you make sure your gowns are ready in time for the collection, or do you jet from Paris to New York for a fitting with a client who spends hundreds of thousands of dollars each year to update her wardrobe?
  Negative
But the film also shines a light on the toil it takes to create a look thats effortless  the meticulous structure and painstaking detail that can make a gown float ethereally.
  Positive
Simons added an extra layer of pressure when he got the wild idea to create dresses inspired by the abstract paintings of his longtime friend, American modern artist Sterling Ruby, which required a complicated, decades-old thread-printing technique.
  Positive
His other out-of-the-box and outrageously expensive demand was to rent a Paris mansion for his debut show, then cover the walls of each room with different kinds of fresh flowers.
  Negative
The result is breathtakingly vibrant.
  Very positive
Still, although hes on camera nearly the entire time as a commanding creative figure, Simons the man remains elusive.
  Neutral
We learn much more about his longtime right hand, the flirty and charming  Pieter Mulier.
  Positive
It probably also helps that Mulier primarily speaks French' Simons, meanwhile, speaks the language imperfectly but earnestly when he nervously first meets the members of his atelier.
  Very negative
Dior and I wont tell you much about Simons personal life, or his family, or where he lives, or why he does this, which ultimately makes it difficult to connect with him.
  Negative
Interestingly, a little online research reveals, he started out as a furniture designer.
  Negative
Simons is all business.
  Neutral
But when the tears flow at the end of his first show, theres no denying their authenticity in an artificial world.
  Negative
