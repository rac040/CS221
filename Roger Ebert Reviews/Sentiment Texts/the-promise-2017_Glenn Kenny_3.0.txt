The Belfast-born writer and director  Terry George is most at home in settings where there are troubles, and sorry about the unintentional play on words.
  Negative
With director  Jim Sheridan he crafted two of the most searing and memorable films about his homeland and its tortured history, s  In the Name of the Father and s  The Boxer, both starring  Daniel Day-Lewis.
  Positive
When hes been behind the camera himself, he hasnt chosen rom-coms: his  HBO movie A Bright Shining Lie treated the Vietnam debacle from a particular military perspective, and s  Hotel Rwanda took a focused look at one mans action against the Rwandan genocide.
  Very negative
Even Georges little-seen  domestic tragedy Reservation Road had a larger point about societal ills animating its core.
  Negative
With  The Promise, George, co-writing with  Robin Swicord, treats the Armenian genocide of the early part of the  th  century, an action undertaken by the soon-to-be-displaced Ottoman Empire, as a side exercise in its alliance with Germany as World War I was about to break out.
  Negative
Well over a million souls were killed in this action, which the contemporary Turkish government still declines to acknowledge.
  Neutral
Indeed, the recent movie  The Ottoman Lieutenant, set in the same period as this one, is produced in part by Turkish interests and has several scenes in which theres a pronounced whatever Armenians WERE killed kind of had it coming vibe.
  Negative
And this film has been preemptively down-voted on IMDb by Armenian genocide deniers.
  Negative
One nice thing about George is that when he takes on a subject, he doesnt flinch or back down about the truths he needs to convey.
  Positive
But its hard to deny that in some respects, The Promise takes a long way to getting around to the meat of the story.
  Negative
George and Swicord have chosen to focus the story around a love triangle.
  Negative
Young Mikael Boghosian, an apothecary from a village in Southern Turkey, betroths himself to a young woman from a family of means in order to go to Constantinople to attend medical school.
  Negative
At the house of the well-off relative with whom hes lodging, he meets the beautiful Anna, an artist whos also Armenian.
  Positive
Anna is married to Chris Myers, a committed American journalist whos also a hard-headed hard drinker.
  Negative
You see where this is going.
  Neutral
As Mikael,  Oscar Isaac doesnt settle into his role right away, perhaps because for a while there isnt much of a role to settle into.
  Positive
He is the embodiment of goodness, of earnestness.
  Positive
Making a friend at the institute where hes enrolled, the fellow student asks So youve already studied medicine?
  Negative
and Mikael answers, Yes, its my passion, and all the ingenuousness Isaac can bring to bear on the character doesnt rescue the line.
  Negative
Once he admits his passion to Anna, he also reminds himself and her that he is indeed promised to another.
  Positive
Anna, in an excellent portrayal by  Charlotte Le Bon, is the one who winds up pushing the issue.
  Positive
If  Christian Bales performance as Chris has the most vigor and intelligence, its at least in part because the troubled character himself has those traits in the most abundance.
  Positive
Alliances are formed, trusts are broken, and then history intrudes' these three characters lose and find each other time and again as war destroys everything around them in each of the environments they travel to.
  Negative
For Mikael, thats initially a prison camp, where after a depiction of the depredations of hard labor, a dramatic incident involving weeping dynamite affords him his escape.
  Negative
He then returns to his village, where he does marry Maral, the young woman hed left behind' the couples families hide them in a mountain cabin, and Mikael grows to love his bide.
  Negative
The theme of the good man who becomes a devoted husband while secretly loving another from afar is reminiscent of  Doctor Zhivago.
  Negative
But while Anna and Myers take up resistance to the Armenian evacuations at a Protestant Mission, the Turkish exterminators are rampaging.
  Negative
The movie hits its cinematic stride, as it happens, when events are at their worst.
  Positive
"The Promise" is drenched in production value and replete with ravishing shots of sunrises and sunsets, but its in the scenes of fleeing, of battle, and of horrendous loss that the film is at its most effective.
  Neutral
The depiction of the savagery inflicted on Armenia is bracing.
  Positive
George is determined to make his story as much about the dead as about the fictional survivors.
  Neutral
Its in that respect that The Promise earns its unsettling honor.
  Positive
