"Ivory Tower" raises a number of fascinating questions and offers numerous facts on the current, deeply flawed state of the American system of higher education but suffers from a lack of focus or even a hint of what we do about the situation.
  Negative
In fact, there are at least three sections of "Ivory Tower" that could be branched out into their own, more satisfying standalone documentaries, including profiles of the UnCollege Movement, the recent events at the Cooper Union, and the lessons learned in the relationship between San Jose State University and the online learning company Udacity.

And as federal money has been taken away from our countrys education, the loan movement has begun to resemble the subprime housing crisis, giving people debt that their children will have to repay.

And "Ivory Tower" serves as a way to start the conversation about why education is seen as a financial privilege instead of a right for all who need it or are willing to work for it.
  Negative
Half of our college-educated people in this country under  are underemployed or unemployed, with debt that is increasing at rates that should be illegal.
  Negative
Something has to be done.
  Positive
Its understandable that "Ivory Tower" director  Andrew Rossi isnt certain what that "something" is but his unfocused approach for at least the first half of his documentary is downright jarring.
  Negative
Stats fly across the screen like the fact that  of the students who are paying small fortunes for their education at public universities wont graduate within four years.
  Neutral
And then weve moved on before that stat or its impact is placed in context.
  Positive
The film jumps from the impact of Harvard on the education system as a whole to the party school atmosphere at Arizona State University to the interesting story of Deep Springs College, without spending enough time on any of these stories to give them resonance.

This chapter of "Ivory Tower" is easily its strongest, and could have served as the whole documentary, seeing as it is really the culmination of so many issues in our educational crisis today.
  Positive
I had similar feelings about later chapters on the UnCollege movement a San Francisco-based community of people who are trying to use so many of the tools now available to young people to learn without academia and the fascinating story of Udacity, one that reminds us of the value of traditional education.
  Positive
Perhaps Rossi places the Udacity saga near the final act of "Ivory Tower" to circle back to the beginning.
  Neutral
"Well, the Harvard model may not be working, but we havent found a better one."
  Neutral
If the message of "Ivory Tower" is that we have to accept our broken system, its a hard one to take especially for this father of three.
  Negative
The crucial question that "Ivory Tower" fails to ask is the most important one of all: What do we do now?
