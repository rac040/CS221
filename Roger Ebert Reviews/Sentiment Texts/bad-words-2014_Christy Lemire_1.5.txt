There's nothing shocking about the R-rated comedy anymore.
  Negative
From " The Hangover" trilogy to " Ted" to " Bridesmaids" to Judd Apatow's entire oeuvre, we have heard and seen it all every profane word, every inane deed, every mind-altering substance ingested and bodily fluid expelled.
  Negative
But the shock itself is not enough.
  Negative
Saying something rude or doing something crude means nothing without context and character.
  Negative
A little bit of nuance, which might seem out of place in such raunchy environs, actually goes a long way.
  Negative
"Bad Words" repeatedly tries to shock us for shock's sake.
  Negative
Directing for the first time and playing the lead character,  Jason Bateman offers us an unapologetically unlikable figure in Guy Trilby, a -year-old genius who muscles his way into a prestigious national spelling bee.
  Negative
Bateman has made a career out of playing the smartest guy in the room, most notably as the put-upon Michael Bluth on "Arrested Development," and his verbal agility is unmatched.
  Negative
Here, Bateman uses his signature deadpan delivery to lacerate everyone around him.
  Negative
Men, women and children, strangers and acquaintances no one escapes Guy's racist, homophobic, misogynistic wrath.
  Negative
Many of the zingers in the script from  Andrew Dodge hit their targets' many other land with a thud.
  Negative
But more often than not, Guy's shtick is just plain mean in a way that becomes dull and repetitive as he dares us to tolerate him.
  Negative
"Bad Words" feels like a warmed-over " Bad Santa" an R-rated comedy that seemed truly subversive and novel back in .
  Negative
The difference there was that Billy Bob Thornton's character was self-loathing and self-destructive in a way that gave him some glimmers of damaged humanity.
  Negative
He was a jerk but at least he was an interesting jerk, and having a beer with him probably would result in an entertaining evening.
  Negative
It's difficult to understand why anyone would want to hang out with Bateman's Guy.
  Negative
Most baffling of all is Kathryn Hahn's character, Jenny, an online journalist who's been tagging along with him and paying for his entry fees, hotel rooms and rental cars en route to The Golden Quill national championship in Los Angeles.
  Negative
She's doing all this in hopes of getting the exclusive story on what's driving him to trounce a bunch of studious -year-olds.
  Negative
But truly, who cares?
  Negative
Jenny is also so needy, she's willing to jump in bed with him at every opportunity, despite the fact that he consistently stonewalls and insults her.
  Negative
There isn't even a love-hate chemistry here.
  Negative
It's just hate.
  Negative
Hahn can be a daring comedian with a total lack of vanity' despite sharing a great deal of screen time with Bateman, she doesn't get much to work with here.
  Negative
Guy's other unlikely companion is -year-old Chaitanya Chopra  Rohan Chand, a sweetly nerdy, lonely competitor who looks to Guy as an ersatz friend and father figure.
  Negative
With his long-lashed doe eyes and ever-present binder full of spelling words, Chaitanya is incessantly sunny in the face of Guy's dismissive racial slurs.
  Negative
He calls the kid "Slumdog" and makes references to his "curry hole," for example.
  Negative
It's not all that offensive, but it's not all that funny, either.
  Negative
Chand's expressiveness, and the way he holds his own opposite Bateman, are among the few bright spots of "Bad Words."
  Positive
Speaking of which, Bateman has chosen an unappealing, sepia-toned lighting scheme for the picture that makes everything look as if it's been smeared with beer and tobacco.
  Negative
Eventually, the kid wears him down.
  Negative
But while the montage of their drunken night of shoplifting and vandalism may be the most thrilling, stylishly edited part of "Bad Words," it also makes zero sense in terms of who these characters are and the competition that means so much to them for very different reasons.
  Negative
Yes, Guy has a motivation for surrounding himself with awkward grade-schoolers and withstanding the attacks from outraged parents and bee officials: revenge.
  Negative
Bringing class to these lowbrow proceedings are  Allison Janney as the competition's uptight administrator and  Philip Baker Hall as The Golden Quill's esteemed chief, who are both hell-bent on kicking him out.
  Negative
Once we understand what's driving Guy, the revelation is airless: It feels like too little, too late.
  Very negative
Now we're supposed to care about whether he has feelings?
  Neutral
Bateman has a strong dramatic streak in him that he doesn't get to tap into often enough see: " Juno," or even his brief appearance in the bombastic "Smokin' Aces" so his instincts during the film's few serious points are undeniable.
  Negative
Those moments also make you wish his gifts and his experience on both sides of the camera were in the service of smarter material.
  Positive
