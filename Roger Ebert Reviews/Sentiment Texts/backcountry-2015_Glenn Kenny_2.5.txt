When I was a kid, this was my favorite place in the whole world.
  Very positive
Under normal life circumstances, this is a harmless enough utterance.
  Negative
In a motion picture in which the place is a national park that the ostensible hero insists he remembers so well that he refuses the offer of a map from a ranger upon arriving, it is a nearly certain indicator of not-to-be-favorited events to come.
  Negative
And so is the case of Backcountry, a very-well executed wilderness thriller written and directed by  Adam MacDonald and apparently inspired by a true story that the movie made me very much not want to look up, which I suppose may be taken by some to be a token of its effectiveness.
  Negative
The movie is sufficiently potent in its depiction of the perils of unsupervised camping that Ive actually seen one reviewer go so far as to air suspicions that the movie has some kind of lets just turn all this forest into a parking lot agenda.
  Negative
I dont think the movie goes quite that far.
  Neutral
Rather, its message, if it can be said to have one, is, Dont go camping with an idiot.
  Negative
The movie opens with Attractive Young Canadian People Alex  Jeff Roop and Jenn  Missy Peregrym bantering as they drive to a wilderness destination.
  Negative
Shes jokingly reading from a rate your boyfriend feature in a magazine' hes asking if can start a fire without matches is among the quizs criteria.
  Negative
Once parked, Alex commits the first of many mishaps by refusing the map offer.
  Negative
While Alex looks at Jenn as being a bit too buttoned-up shes a lawyer and stuff, he is committed to the idea of impressing her with all manner of Canuck Tarzan stuff, which he intends to climax by proposing marriage.
  Negative
Best-laid plans continue to go awry.
  Negative
Jenns not to enthusiastic about skinny dipping in the old swimming hole.
  Neutral
A little later, as hes chopping wood, Alex hears voices' why, its Jenn speaking to some buff Irish fellow named Brad  Eric Balfour who describes himself as a wilderness guide.
  Negative
That we meet this fellow in the middle of his conversation with the female member of the couple is one of director MacDonalds not-unfamiliar directorial feints.
  Positive
Whats this interloper going to bring to the party?
  Neutral
Well, fresh fish, for one thing.
  Positive
Sequences of shots that indirectly juxtapose Alex and Jenns shiny newly-purchased camping equipment with the messy business of fish-gutting convey a sense of disorder that cant be tamed.
  Negative
Later, sitting by the fire, Alex stammers when the stately, studly Brad asks him how he makes a living.
  Negative
Right now my buddy has a landscaping business Oh dear.
  Negative
One gets the uneasy feeling that the movie is working up some kind of allegorical statement on the Condition Of Contemporary Masculinity, and a certain species of sexual tension is evoked when Brad utters the line Lets see the potatoes.
  Negative
These considerations are magically transformed into red herrings, though, once a big hungry bear shows up.
  Positive
After which its arrgh, ugh, and ick time.
  Negative
MacDonald cant be faulted in his use of special effects, judiciously dropped-out sound, and other varieties of cinematic eloquence in conveying pretty unspeakable grisliness.
  Positive
After which there is flight, and pursuit, and a lot of widescreen compositions in which a pursued character is scrunched into the left side of the frame, the better to give the viewer a panorama of whatever beast might pop up from behind that character.
  Positive
Its all pretty effective but in the end, somehow empty.
  Negative
Not to make an unfair comparison to a classic, but the movie  Deliverance actually followed through on all of the themes that its storyline suggested, while in Backcountry, we end up with a storyline in which all but the most elemental stuff winds up as window dressing.
  Negative
Some might see this as a blessing somehow I have to admit Im not particularly keen on anyones take on the Condition Of Contemporary Masculinity anyway, but that could just be me but at the closing of the movie, for all the unusual action and suspense it packed, I felt a sense of evasion.
  Negative
Also, the Godspeed You!
  Positive
Black Emperor sound-alike-score from Frres Lumires is a little irksome in its sound alikeness.
  Negative
