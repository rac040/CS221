Knowing that the Spanish drama Ma Ma is about a woman coping with breast cancer, I was curious to check out beforehand how many well-known Hollywood films have tackled the subject in the past.
  Negative
Considering that the disease is currently the nation's most common cancer according to the American Cancer Society, there are surprisingly few of note.
  Negative
Of course, the  Oscar-winning  Terms of Endearment is the grandma of such weepers.

Then there was last years buddy pic  Miss You Already.
  Neutral
Both s  Pieces of April and s  The Family Stone are centered on holiday-themed family gatherings where the matriarch is at risk.
  Negative
And the  camp classic  Valley of the Dolls, of all things, had  Sharon Tates sex symbol desperately opting for suicide after her diagnosis.
  Negative
But breast cancer has been more frequently and, perhaps, better dealt with by TV movies Lifetimes short-film anthology Five and medical-themed series Greys Anatomy or ER than it has on the big screen.
  Negative
Ma Ma could be a case study on why that is, despite capitalizing on the considerable charms of  Penelope Cruz, who is both star and producer.
  Negative
She is present with every pulse of her being as Magda, a young mother in Madrid who learns in the first scene that she must undergo chemo, followed by a mastectomy.
  Negative
She initially frets more about the pending loss of her right nipple an ongoing theme and having to reschedule her hair appointment than she does the status of her health.
  Neutral
Meanwhile, the other less-than-uplifting circumstances of her life defined by an absent philandering philosophy professor husband, a soccer-mad son who craves a father figure and her status as an unemployed teacher slosh around her like a tub brimming with soap-operatic suds.
  Negative
Not that writerdirector  Julio Medem playing it safer than he did with his  sensation Sex and Lucia avoids pulling out all the indie visual stops to heighten the experience of seeing Magda's inner transformation as the disease alters her viewpoint and the choices she makes.
  Negative
Ma Ma opens with what turns into a recurring image of an icy pane of glass that reveals a pale, sad-faced girl walking through a blizzard.
  Negative
With its spacious balcony,Magdas well-appointed apartment is almost Nancy Meyers-level in its dcor, while subdued piano music plays in the background.
  Negative
And when she feels the woozy effects of her ordeals, the camera goes back and forth like a wave-battered dinghy.
  Negative
We also get to occasionally peer at her heart as its beat shifts according to what she is undergoing, with frequent jump-cuts keeping us on guard.
  Negative
But for all of these artistic touches as a director, Medem the screenwriter disappointingly provides zero female support in the form of relatives or friends for Magda, save for a kindly nurse.
  Negative
Instead, her handsome married gynecologist Julin  Asier Etxeandia seems to have endless time to devote to Magdas well-being, including serenading her now and then with cheesy love ballads.
  Negative
She also runs into a kindly soccer scout named Arturo  Luis Tosar at her sons match, just as Arturo receives the tragic news that his daughter has died in a car crash and his wife is in a coma.
  Negative
How convenient that they can rely on each other to fill their emotional gaps as Magdas husband gallivants about all summer with a beautiful student.
  Negative
Magda follows doctors orders after her operation and heads to the beach with her son, uncomfortable with his mothers physical changes, and the introverted Arturo, who steadfastly keeps matters platonic even after his wife dies.
  Negative
With a  chance of being cancer-free, she is determined to carry on by bravely shaving her hair, wearing a wig, using a prosthetic breast and plotting to buy new boobs.
  Negative
But when Magda receives bad news, the movies last third suddenly turns into a mawkish Hallmark card.
  Negative
Probable death is seen as a glorious opportunity for love, happiness and freedom' a miracle assures her that her valiant spirit will survive no matter the outcome.
  Positive
Decorating these sentiments are claw-flapping red crabs near the water, perhaps a symbol of the disease that ironically has given her inner strength and wisdom.
  Negative
And, in a recovery-room reverie, we are treated to the sight of Magdas beloved nipple preserved on ice.
  Negative
But more important than the washed-out blue-tinged rooms, bleached white interiors and sun-blasted sea and sand is Cruz, who single-handedly breathes a sense of genuineness into this maudlin exercise even if she cant cure all of its flaws.
  Negative
The conundrum continues: How do you do an inspiring breast-cancer story without depressing the audience or resorting to clichs?
  Neutral
Miss You Already, while more original, already showed what happens if you go too far in the other direction.
  Negative
Still, if Ma Ma encourages just one woman to examine herself regularly and not wait to see a doctor if something seems amiss, at least the film will stand as a rather stylish public service announcement for early detection.
  Positive
