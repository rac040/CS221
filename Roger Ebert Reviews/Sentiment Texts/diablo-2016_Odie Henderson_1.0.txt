Scott Eastwoods character, Jackson, gets one hell of an entrance in Diablo: the door to a burning house flies open and, backed by a wall of flames, he appears in shadow in the doorway.
  Negative
When he steps into the light, one sees that the resemblance to Eastwoods father, Clint, is striking.
  Positive
Our minds immediately flash back to Clints westerns, many of which Diablo blatantly rips off.
  Negative
The Outlaw Josey Wales,"  Unforgiven and High Plains Drifter all receive shout-outs as the younger Eastwood goes through the familiar paces of revenge and regret.
  Negative
Unfortunately, his first Western fails to be as good as any of the films it evokes.
  Very negative
Its plot is an unholy blending of  Taken,"  The Searchers and " Angel Heart."
  Negative
As befitting a January release, its also an early candidate for the  worst movies list.
  Negative
But who prays for Satan?
  Neutral
an onscreen quote by  Mark Twain asks at the beginning of the film.
  Negative
The answer is Satans grandmother, but I digress.
  Negative
We are next informed that its , seven years after the Civil War.
  Negative
Jackson fought under General Sherman, and as Diablo opens, Jacksons wife has been kidnapped by the folks who torched his house.
  Negative
Shes been taken, Jackson explains to anyone who will listen, and one hopes hell have a particular set of skills to get her back.
  Very negative
The kidnappers spoke Spanish, so Jackson heads toward Mexico.
  Negative
Along the way, he encounters  Walton Goggins and  Danny Glover, both of whom deserve better.
  Negative
Jackson seeks help from Glovers character, whom he fought alongside during the war.
  Negative
Before they meet up, Jackson receives help from some Indians who tend to his wounds and offer him peyote.
  Positive
The ensuing hallucination is not only poorly executed, it cribs from, of all things,  An American Werewolf in London.
  Negative
For their troubles, the Indians all wind up dead.
  Negative
In fact, anyone who tries to help Jackson winds up dead.
  Negative
That the victims are all minorities made me briefly consider that perhaps screenwriter Carlos de los Rios was attempting some kind of statement about American manifest destiny.
  Negative
Considering how preposterous this movie becomes, I realized I was giving the screenplay too much credit.
  Negative
At least Goggins brings a smarmy, slimy, threatening energy to the film.
  Negative
His character is a major cop-out that youll see coming long before the big reveal.
  Negative
But he makes the most of his miniscule screen time by cutting a dashing figure of evil, the rather seductive kind one might expect from Old Scratch himself.
  Positive
By contrast, Glover is little more than onscreen collateral damage.
  Negative
He provides some crucial information to the viewer regarding Jacksons character before buying the farm.
  Negative
Glovers tense scene with Goggins, which serves as the last appearance of either actor, is the moment Diablo becomes irredeemably bad.
  Very negative
Diablo goes for shock value with its twists, but plays its hand far too early.
  Negative
Our knowledge of events and of character force us to question why the people in the climactic scenes act as stupid as they do.
  Negative
The villain of this piece has a reputation that precedes him as a notorious killer, yet whenever someone gets an opportunity to do him in, they are either too afraid to blow him away or shoot with the accuracy of a Stormtrooper on the Death Star.
  Negative
One unfortunate woman even makes out with him before being shot.
  Negative
Why do you do this to all the women?
  Neutral
she asks.
  Neutral
Your guess will be as good as hers.
  Neutral
Clint Eastwoods career is full of performances where he was unafraid to deal with the darker natures of his characters, and with their weaknesses.
  Negative
Diablo wants to cover similar ground, but gives Scott Eastwood very little of substance to play.
  Negative
As a result, hes merely an enigma who sheds or gains characteristics where convenient.
  Negative
The movie impresses on his empty canvas whatever is necessary at the moment, while horror movie music hints at a doom that turns out to be deeply unsatisfying and almost nonsensical.
  Negative
If nothing else, Diablo looks great, thanks to veteran cinematographer  Dean Cundey and whatever deity carved Alberta, Canada out of the Earth.
  Positive
There are some majestic overhead shots of scenery, and its clear that thought and care was put into the framing of scenes.
  Positive
I wanted to see the Western that deserved this level of visual attentiveness.
  Neutral
Unfortunately, Diablo isnt it.
  Negative
