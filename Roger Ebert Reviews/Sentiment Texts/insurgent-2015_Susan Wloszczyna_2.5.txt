I steeled myself while anticipating the harrowing moment that was hinted at in the trailer.
  Positive
As Tris, the free-thinking fugitive hero of the clumsily titled The Divergent Series: Insurgent,  Shailene Woodley picks up what looks like a pair of gardening shears and manages to somehow transform her lengthy locks into a chic pixie cut worthy of  Vidal Sassoon.
  Negative
No mirror or comb needed apparently.
  Negative
Of all the misleading tropes in the history of cinema, chopping off ones own hair without having it look as if Freddy Krueger was your stylist probably gets on my nerves more than most.
  Negative
That means you, too, Amazing Amy in  Gone Girl.
  Positive
Yes, I know it is a metaphor for change, new beginnings and all that, but such an irresponsible act of DIY should not be encouraged.
  Negative
However, I can fully relate to the reason behind Tris wanting to simplify her beauty regimen, especially since she spends so much of her time on the run in this sequel to last years  Divergent.
  Neutral
As she explains her new do to boyfriend and protector Four  Theo James, whose maturity and manliness nicely offsets the plots more ridiculous turns, I wanted something different.
  Negative
I wanted something different, too.
  Neutral
Instead, Insurgent now and then falls into the same trap as most scripts based on the middle book of a trilogy.
  Negative
As the grimmer YA-literary cousin to  The Hunger Games that also pits young people against each other in mortal combat, this dystopian fable set in a post-apocalyptic Chicago treads much of the same ground as the first film with a modest amount of new information and characters.
  Negative
There is still a lot of jumping on and off of trains, plenty of hand-to-hand combat, much gun violence, some dangling from heights, more than a few fatalities, lots of fancy-schmancy Matrix-like effects and a whole bunch of chatter about the unsettled state of the social order.
  Negative
The Hunger Games with its TV reality-show showbiz trappings at least leavens its gruesome bloodsport elements with outlandish costumes, pageantry and valuable input from colorful supporting characters in the form of  Stanley Tucci,  Elizabeth Banks and  Woody Harrelson.
  Negative
But humorous is not the Divergent franchises natural state.
  Negative
Any sort of relief from the deadly seriousness of what is at stake comes courtesy of the cheeky interjections provided by  Miles Teller, whose opportunistic Peter shifts his allegiances back-and-forth so many times that its enough to give his character whiplash minus the drums.
  Negative
That Insurgent and its predecessor prove to be at least halfway decent diversions is primarily thanks to leading lady Woodleys ability to fully commit to her characters internal journey as she eventually evolves into a self-sacrificing savior figure after being riddled with guilt and grief while summoning the sympathies of the audience.
  Positive
If Woodley is anything, besides being believably kick-ass, she is a world-class weeper a skill she first displayed by wailing at the bottom of a pool as  George Clooneys daughter in  The Descendants.
  Negative
Here, she nails both the single-tear trickle and full-out downpour splendidly.
  Negative
The action once again takes place in a community that is divided into five factions defined by personality traits, with Abnegation left much depleted after an attempted genocide in the first outing.
  Negative
The now in-charge Erudite is once more led by the coolly cruel Jeanine played by an over-qualified  Kate Winslet, initially glimpsed as a giant image spewing propaganda like some sort of Big Sister.
  Negative
Meanwhile, Tris and Four   both faction-defying Divergents and therefore deemed dangerous   are joined by her seemingly timid Erudite brother Caleb  Ansel Elgort and onetime Dauntless member Peter as they find refuge with the peace, love and outdoorsy Amity tribe, overseen by  Octavia Spencers earth mama Johanna.
  Negative
It seems that Jeanine needs to recruit a Divergent to unlock a mysterious golden box she snatched from Tris late mother  Ashley Judd, seen in flashbacks so she unleashes her watchdogs to sniff them out.
  Negative
One chase scene later and they find themselves falling in with Factionless, a group of unaligned outliers whose queen bee is none other than Fours mother, Evelyn, who faked her own death years before.
  Negative
Shes played by a brunette  Naomi Watts, who leaves just enough of an impression to let us know she is not to be trusted.
  Negative
Eventually, Tris and Four reunite with their old Dauntless mates before the climatic faceoff inside Erudite headquarters.
  Negative
Directed by action specialist  Robert Schwentke  Red,  Flightplan, Insurgent surges along with capable set pieces but less meaningful human interaction than in Divergent.
  Negative
But at least two sequences deserve applause.
  Negative
The first is when the Candor faction is finally introduced, with  Daniel Dae Kim of TVs Lost and Hawaii Five- as their chief justice.
  Negative
One nice touch: The members are all dressed in black and white, since there is no gray area when honesty is involved, natch.
  Positive
The tension palpably builds when Tris and Four are put on trial and injected with truth serum, forcing them to answer some difficult questions and allowing the actors to actually act.
  Negative
The other noteworthy scene arrives at the end when Tris has to undergo a series of five sims   hallucinatory simulations that test her ability to puzzle her way out of tight situations and test our ability to know what is real and what is fake onscreen.
  Negative
The most memorable is when Tris must engage in a struggle with herself, which ultimately allows her to achieve self-forgiveness.
  Positive
In the end, the stage is set for Tris to lead the charge and save the world as the third book, Allegiant, is split into two films.
  Negative
Much like Woodley herself almost singlehandedly saves these films from being just another overwrought dystopian nightmare.
  Negative
