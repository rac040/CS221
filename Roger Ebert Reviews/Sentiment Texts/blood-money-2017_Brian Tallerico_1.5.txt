For an hour,  Lucky McKees Blood Money is aggressively annoying, the kind of film with no likable or believable characters, and one of those cheap VOD flicks in which it feels like everyone was there purely for the paycheck.
  Negative
The final  minutes of this B-movie reveal why a few talented people were interested in making it, but its too little too late by that point, especially since most people who watch this at home will have moved on to something else anyway.
  Negative
Victor  Ellar Coltrane of  Boyhood, Jeff  Jacob Artist and Lynn  Willa Fitzgerald are going on a rafting trip but bringing enough baggage with them to sink their boat.
  Negative
The three are old friends but Jeff is with Lynn now, although theyre trying to keep that a secret from Victor, who may or may not have a crush on Lynn.
  Negative
Sadly, most of this early character exposition is clunky and inconsistent.
  Very negative
The dialogue alternates between unbelievable and moronic, and the actors dont do enough to make this trio of idiots easy to root for.
  Very negative
Far more interesting is the criminal Miller  John Cusack, whos dressed like a Metallica groupie and looking for the millions of dollars he just stole, parachuting with it out of a plane D.B. Cooper-style.
  Negative
One can guess who finds the money.
  Neutral
In a nod to the long history of fiction and films in which money divides unions the film is reportedly loosely inspired by  The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, believe it or not Jeff, Lynn and Victor have a tough time agreeing on what do with the found fortune.
  Negative
Good guy Victor immediately wants to turn it in, knowing that no good can come of bags of money found in the woods.
  Negative
Lynn has other ideas.
  Neutral
Screwed over by a bad knee that has derailed her future, at least in her mind, she sees the money as karmic justice for the shit shes had to put up with, and Blood Money gets way more interesting when Lynns search for retribution gains a bit of a gender-edge.
  Very negative
Fitzgerald totally sells a great scene in which Lynn rails about how she was an equal friend of Victor and Jeffs until she hit puberty and became property to fight over.
  Positive
I wish Blood Money invested more time and energy in this theme of male possessiveness, especially earlier, when the film feels unfocused and uncertain.
  Negative
Part of that first hour feels borderline incomplete.
  Negative
The dialogue is clunkyin such a way that youll think your DVD skipped a few seconds, and the characters are weirdly inconsistent.
  Very negative
Theres an exposition while the kids drink a few scene early on that is bafflingly written and edited.
  Negative
The rhythm is all off.
  Negative
And McKee, so good at bringing tension and atmosphere to  May and The Woman, cant get excited about this material.
  Negative
Its filmed in a flat, dull way that brings nothing to the piece.
  Negative
When you start to wonder if the film is making continuity errors I swear it goes from overcast to sunny and back again a few times you know somethings wrong.
  Negative
As for Cusack, hes having a little bit of fun, but this is closer to the paycheck roles he often takes than it probably should have or could have been.
  Positive
As Blood Money becomes more and more about two dummies who really dont getthe woman theyre fighting over, it becomes more interesting.
  Negative
Its just too far down the B-movie river to be saved by that point.
