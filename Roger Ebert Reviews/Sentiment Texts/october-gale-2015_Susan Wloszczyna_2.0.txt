A confession: I could watch  Patricia Clarkson do just about anything.
  Negative
Brush her teeth, run on a treadmill, eat a hot dog.
  Negative
Doesnt matter.
  Neutral
She is just one of those actresses who is always fascinating to observe, even when the movie she appears in isnt.
  Very positive
What this sublime performer can achieve simply with subtle shifts of her facial expressions especially that Mona Lisa smile usually rimmed with luscious crimson is the equal of a Shakespearean soliloquy.
  Positive
So be glad that for about  or so precious minutes early on in October Gale, Clarksons ultimately disappointing reunion with Cairo Time filmmaker  Ruba Nadda, we are privileged to have this talented woman all to ourselves.
  Negative
The best parts of this tepid thriller, which seems designed to actually lower audiences heart rates, arrive before the plot kicks in.
  Very negative
That is when Toronto doctor Helen returns to a cozy family cabin on a picturesque remote island to face the misty watercolor memories of her loving husband of  years, who died the year before.
  Negative
She is tasked with reawakening the vacation retreat that appears to have been frozen in time.
  Negative
As Helen silently goes about disposing of the detritus of their final moments together, certain objects such as articles of tossed-aside clothing, scattered photos and old newspapers spark gauzy flashback interludes that are quite lovely to witness.
  Negative
What results is a graceful portrait of quiet grieving, and Clarkson turns it into a small masterpiece.
  Positive
But then Helens motorboat, her main mode of transportation to the mainland, conks out.
  Negative
And, as we gather from scenes of her waving her cell phone in the air, she is also without a means of communication.
  Negative
Naturally, a violent rainstorm begins to brew.
  Negative
Regretfully, we will soon have to share her with a mysterious bleeding stranger who washes ashore and stumbles into her home before passing out.
  Negative
While the physician dutifully tends to the bullet wound in his shoulder, she also is nervous about having a younger man lurking about who someone obviously wanted to kill.
  Negative
However, that Will, as he is known, is played by Ben from Felicity namely,  Scott Speedman pretty much guarantees that A he is relatively benign and B this handsome, well-mannered guy might summon more than just maternal feelings in Helen.
  Neutral
Trust is indeed an issue at first but nothing that a few shared cups of coffee, a friendly game of cribbage and the fact that he returns her kindness by preventing her from drowning cant fix.
  Negative
Reality, however, comes a-knocking when a local handyman pays an unexpected visit and, after figuring out that Helen is not alone, he suddenly races off.
  Negative
Seems that he is in cahoots with whoever wants to dispose of Will and will likely return soon.
  Negative
With Cairo Time, which also found Clarkson drawn to a stranger, Nadda created an intoxicating atmosphere where the heat of the Egyptian environs and the attraction between two culturally divided people seemed to radiate from the screen.
  Positive
The Canadian writerdirector knows how to generate believable connections between characters, as shown by the emotional bonding agent in the form of past regrets that is shared by Helen and Will.
  Positive
But when it comes to building suspense, Nadda is never going to be known as the next Hitchcock.
  Negative
The first warning signs arrive when October Gale stoops to old-fashioned dark and stormy night theatrics lightning, thunder, high winds and shaky pine branches.
  Negative
But save for a few bouts of scowling and a smattering of tattoos on his torso, Speedmans Will never seems to be a real threat to Clarksons Helen.
  Negative
Certainly, she drops her guard rather quickly.
  Neutral
And when danger does arrive in the form of Wills pursuer  Tim Roth, almost always a human warning sign, the action scenes are rather clumsily handled and edited.
  Negative
Worse, there is an awkwardly inserted flashback besides those experienced by Helen that clearly is there only to clumsily explain an important story point.
  Negative
Nadda has proven herself to be an impressive storyteller in the past but she is way outside of her comfort zone here.
  Positive
You either have the genre gene or you dont.
  Neutral
But at least she provides some room for Clarkson to show her stuff before she is reduced to taking aim at bad guys in the darkened woods.
  Negative
By that point, though, any potential value in October Gale ends up being gone with the wind.
  Negative
