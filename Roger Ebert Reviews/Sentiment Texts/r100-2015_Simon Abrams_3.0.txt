There's a reason why "R," a deeply strange comedy about sadomasochism and other secular revelations, starts with a joke-y disclaimer.
  Negative
The film, which takes its name from an imaginary censor board's rating like the MPAA's "R" rating, only forbidden to anyone under  years of ago, is deeply silly, but also startlingly outlandish, and more than a little punishing in its repetitiveness.
  Very negative
This, of course, is the film's point.
  Neutral
Japanese comedian-turned-filmmaker  Hitoshi Matsumoto " Big Man Japan," "Symbol" wants you to laugh at its lead character, Takafumi Nao Ohmori, for taking pleasure from pain.
  Positive
Takafumi is pathetic because he achieves sublime transcendence every time leather-clad dominatrices beat him up.
  Negative
Takafumi's masochism is, in that sense, not treated seriously sorry, "Fifty Shades of Grey" fans!
  Negative
because it's just the catalyst for a series of abidingly strange episodes that are all about one thing: escaping the hell that is yourself.
  Negative
Matsumoto's style of comedy is, in that sense, a far-flung descendant of Jerry Lewis' slapstick-y, self-loathing schtick.
  Negative
"R" is, consequently, a comedy that tries to alienate you by suggesting that escapism is futile, all things inevitably devolve, and nothing inherently means anything.
  Negative
"R" may leave you feeling utterly defeated when it ends with Matsumoto's comedic variation on the Star Child finale of " : A Space Odyssey."
  Negative
But that's mostly because it will dredge up laughs from your gut even after it makes you hate Matsumoto for willfully repeating himself, then ducking his film's ickier conceits by diving into gross and seriously childish tangents.
  Negative
So even if you like bizarre movies, you'll probably like "R," then hate it, then go back to liking it, then wonder what you're looking at.
  Negative
And then the movie will end.
  Neutral
Where was I?
  Neutral
Oh, right, the plot.
  Positive
So, Takafumi gets kicked in the face, and thrown down a flight of stairs by a very sexy, terribly bored woman, which makes Takafumi realize how much he likes being dominated not necessarily in a sexual way, mind you, though yes, there is a lot of that in "R." Takafumi desperately wants to escape his dreary home-life, which consists of taking care of son Arashi  Haruki Nishimoto while wife Setsuko lies comatose in a nearby hospital.
  Negative
So Takafumi joins a mysterious gentlemen's club whose services eventually escalate in perversity, from being dominated in a sushi restaurant to being flogged and spat on at home, right next door to Arashi's bedroom.
  Negative
The longer that Takafumi enjoys being dominated his cheeks puff out, his pupils bulge, and a pulsing halo surounds his head whenever he scales the heights of masochistic pleasure the less he likes himself.
  Negative
So Takafumi tries to leave the gentlemen's club.
  Negative
But the more he tries to quit, the stranger his encounters with dominatrices like the Queen of Voices  Mao Daichi and the Queen of Saliva  Naomi Watanabe get.
  Negative
Like the time he's stood up at a bowling alley, and learns to enjoy being ignored for hours.
  Positive
If you follow the logic or lack thereof of Takafumi's narrative, you'll find that " R" teaches viewers how to watch it as its plot perpetually breaks down, then reforms.
  Negative
You cannot trust the film to deal with its dark subject matter since it's constantly admitting that Takafumi's search for carnal enlightenment is necessarily frustrated.
  Negative
Since Takafumi likes losing control, he keeps losing it until the film goes off its sprockets, and we get a fictitiousbehind-the-scenes look at perplexed filmmakers and censors behind the film.
  Negative
Sorry, "the film."
  Positive
Then the movie starts again.
  Neutral
And then it stops, then starts again.
  Negative
If you try to get closure from " R," it will beat you.
  Positive
