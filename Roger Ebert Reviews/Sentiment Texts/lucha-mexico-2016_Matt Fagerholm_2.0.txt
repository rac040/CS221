Why are sports such as boxing and wrestling thrilling to watch in narrative films but often tough to take in real life?
  Neutral
Martin Scorseses  Raging Bull and  Darren Aronofskys  The Wrestler arent compelling for their violence so much as for their ability to probe the psychology of their central male characters.
  Positive
What drives these men to repeatedly abuse themselves in fights designed to reduce their bodies to slabs of butchered meat?
  Negative
The aforementioned masterworks by Scorsese and Aronofsky offer quite a few potential answers to this question, none of which are explored with any real depth in  Alex Hammond and  Ian Markiewiczs documentary, Lucha Mexico.
  Negative
Certainly fans of the Lucha Libre brand encompassing Mexicos beloved wrestling stars will find this repetitive assemblage of footage diverting, yet I quickly found it tiresome.
  Negative
Theres only so much one can glean from scenes of these guys posing for pictures while feeding the camera pat soundbites about how the love of fans serves as their primary motivation.
  Negative
From an outsiders perspective, the cheering at these matches sounds less like an expression of love and more like the enabling howls heard amidst the bleeped expletives on Maury.
  Negative
At a time when the physical toll of punishing sports is being reevaluated in films such as last years Concussion, its difficult for me to get much enjoyment out of the theatrical machismo and unsettling masochism on display here, no matter how staged it may be.
  Negative
Perhaps limiting the films focus to a handful of wrestlers wouldve forced the directors to delve deeper into their subjects.
  Negative
Instead, the documentary skips so quickly from one masked face to the next that they all become interchangeable, with the obvious exception of KeMonito, the furry mascot famous for getting kicked around like a rag doll.
  Negative
The only recurring plot thread involves the recovery of Shocker Jair Soria Reyna, whose ruptured patellar tendon sent him into a depression that is articulated but left off-screen.
  Negative
I wish the film spent more time with former wrestler Tony Salazar, who is briefly seen instructing students on how to perform wrestling moves in a way that will result in minimal injuries.
  Negative
An examination of the meticulous stunt work involved in a given match wouldve made for a far more interesting movie, but Lucha Mexico opts for holding its subjects at arms length, as if to preserve the magic of their superhuman abilities.
  Negative
That is how the public prefers to view them, with many young fans dressing up as their favorite wrestlers.
  Positive
In Mexico, these costumes appear to be as popular as those for Marvel superheroes.
  Neutral
Indeed, when Jon Strongman tears off his shirt and flexes his towering muscles, its hard not to think of the Hulk.
  Negative
Yet as much as these men would prefer not to admit it, they are mortals capable of being irreparably wounded or worse in the ring.
  Negative
After Strongman badly injures his arm, his opponent pummels the damaged limb repeatedly despite the mans cries to stop.
  Very negative
If safe words are required in  Fifty Shades of Grey, shouldnt they be mandatory in wrestling?
  Negative
Of course, thats nothing compared to the Perros del Mal matches, where the blood of wrestlers is spilled via broken lights bulbs and barbed wire.
  Negative
Though the majority of audience members are said to be aged  and over, I spotted plenty of underage faces in the crowd and later on, at the gift shop.
  Positive
One interviewee suggests that turbulent times in Mexico have caused citizens to identify with the bad guys, and these words are accompanied by footage of protestors marching through the streets.
  Negative
Sadly, this is about as far as the filmmakers care to elaborate not only on this topic, but virtually every other one in the picture.
  Negative
Blue Demon Jr. says that the life of a wrestler is a solitary one, as we see him drive off into the darkness.
  Negative
Sexy Star reveals that wrestling helps her overcome depression.
  Positive
These are nice observations, but they mean nothing if the filmmakers dont bother asking a follow-up.
  Neutral
What Hammond and Markiewicz are most gifted at is cinematography.
  Positive
Id gladly watch this films entire B-roll again just to bask in the gorgeous Mexican landscapes and vivid snapshots of the cities, outdoor markets and parking lots where various matches occur.
  Positive
The reality of the surroundings make the phoniness of the wrestlers shtick all the more conspicuous.
  Negative
Occasionally the film will acknowledge the death of a young wrestler without lingering too long on the tragedy for fear of becoming downbeat.
  Negative
Its aggravating to hear their surviving colleagues say that they are leaving their own fate up to God, since that conveniently enables them to not take responsibility for their actions.
  Negative
Resonating through all the sound and fury is Salazars pointed assertion that the rich would never subject themselves to this sort of profession, and that one needs the hunger to succeed and to eat in order to become a Lucha Libre legend.
  Negative
The implication is clear: disenfranchised people must channel their frustration one way or another, so why not apply it to a sport in which your systematic self-destruction is wildly celebrated by adoring fans?
  Negative
To me, theres simply nothing here worth cheering about.
  Positive
