First, some good news: "Dracula Untold," a sort of " Batman Begins" prequel, isn't as tacky as it sounds.
  Negative
There are glimmers of a brooding and icky horror epic scattered throughout the film, particularly in its surprisingly romantic, matte-painting-esque backdrops and impressionistic vampire's-point-of-view shots.
  Negative
But that leads me to the bad news: if you step away from "Dracula Untold" long enough to describe it, you'll realize how soul-crushingly unimaginative it is.
  Very negative
This is, after all, a " Maleficent"-style anti-fable that relies on your instant recognition of Dracula while trying to rehabilitate and recast Bram Stoker's bloodsucker as a Byronic hero.
  Negative
Still, the good news barely outweighs the bad in "Dracula Untold," a lightweight war-adventure that is ultimately stranger and more enticing when it remembers it's also a horror film.
  Negative
In the beginning, a boring narrator natters on about how Vlad "Dracula" Tepes  Luke Evans was a former Transylvanian child soldier who was abducted by Turks, trained to fight, blah blah blah...he's a killing machine.
  Very negative
Then, we actually meet the guy: a soldier kneeling in prayer before a forest of pikes bearing his impaled foes.
  Neutral
It's a creepy image, and one that should be held for at least twice as long as it is.
  Negative
Unfortunately, the makers of "Dracula Untold" typically hit the fast-forward button, and rush to the next chain of events.
  Negative
Vlad is given an ultimatum from Turkish Sultan Mehmed  Dominic Cooper while feasting with angelic wife Mirena  Sarah Gadon, she of the blue eyes, and generous cleavage: give Mehmed  Transylvanian child soldiers, or take on Mehmed's overwhelming forces.
  Negative
Herein enters the homo-eroticism that the film sometimes cannot suppress: Vlad and Mehmed are childhood rivals, trained together in the army of Mehmed's father.
  Negative
But Mehmed's threat is a visceral reminder of events that are only alluded to in the aforementioned voiceover-reliant introduction.
  Neutral
Vlad strikes a deal with a vampire  Charles Dance that offers him an alternative deal: stay human and die, or temporarily become a vampire and destroy Mehmed's army.
  Negative
This would be a simple choice were it not for a ridiculous convolution: if Vlad drinks human blood, he will permanently become a vampire, and wind up sucking forever.
  Negative
Yes, that was a pun, and no, you don't get an apology.
  Negative
Nor should you expect one in a review of "Dracula Untold," a bizarrely ambitious popcorn cash-in that's also half-baked in all the expected ways.
  Neutral
The film's battle scenes are over-edited, Cooper's villain is a snooze, and there's simply not enough sex and death in an origin story about the archetypal sexual predator.
  Negative
Instead, there's a predictable attempted-rape scene, and a lot of paradoxically plodding hints that Mehmed and the Turks weren't that into women.
  Negative
There are also several scenes where Dracula turns into a cloud of bats, and even one scene where he scales a black cliff bare-handed while wearing a red cape, as if he were Wagner's Siegfried.
  Negative
If you can selectively ignore this litany of inanity, you may find some substantial earthy pleasures in "Dracula Untold."
  Negative
Despite its PG- rating, the film does periodically erupt into surprisingly gruesome violence, like when a vampire is gored, then reduced into an emaciated corpse.
  Negative
And cinematographer  John Schwartzman " The Rock," " Armageddon" reminds you why  Michael Bay used to love working with him in every day-for-night landscape shot.
  Negative
Evans is surprisingly good at smoldering, and special-effects-reliant shots of Vlad turning into a monster are usually pretty enticing.
  Positive
These small, moody charms add up, and give a film that sounds so very dumb some much-needed atmosphere.
  Negative
There's not much more to "Dracula Untold," but it does periodically throb with surface-deep tension.
  Negative
