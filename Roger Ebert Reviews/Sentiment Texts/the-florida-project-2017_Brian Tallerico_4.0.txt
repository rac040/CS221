Its hard to describe The Florida Project in a way that conveys its greatness without making it sound maudlin and sentimental.
  Negative
It is one of those films that defies its plot description through its execution.
  Negative
It is a film of small notes that combine to form something major, the kind of movie that sneaks up on you and sticks with you.
  Very positive
Like last years Best Picture winner,  Moonlight, it achieves much of its brilliance through specificity.
  Positive
It is an all-too-common story of a single mother and her daughter on the edge of the social ladder, but it is told in a way that embraces its details instead of trying to achieve some sort of universal statement.
  Positive
Co-writerdirector  Sean Baker very carefully conveys the specific truths of his characters daily lives and its that honesty that makes The Florida Project so powerful.
  Positive
This is a remarkable film, one of the best of the year.
  Very positive
The Magic Castle motel is the kind of place most people dont even notice as they speed past it on their way to the Magic Kingdom.
  Negative
On a strip of cheap motels, gun stores, tourist traps, and various other establishments, this motel houses all kinds, from the tourists looking for something cheap or, in one of the movies funniest scenes, booking the wrong hotel to the working class who have basically turned it into permanent lodging.
  Negative
Baker very purposefully introduces us to his child protagonists first, best friends Moonee  Brooklynn Prince and Scooty  Christopher Rivera.
  Positive
Theyre running to a neighboring motel so they can spit on a car from the balcony above.
  Negative
Its just one of those silly things kids do when they have nothing else planned.
  Neutral
Just another day nearthe happiest place on Earth.
  Negative
After the owner of the car gets angry, Moonee and Scooty get a third partner-in-crime in her granddaughter, the sweet Jancey  Valeria Cotto.
  Negative
And heres where we get to one of those aforementioned points where The Florida Project becomes hard to put into words.
  Negative
If I tell you that it consists largely of the adventures of these precocious motel-residing kids, it would probably sound like some horribly cloying piece of Hollywood trash, those movies that idealize youth and really look down on poverty.
  Negative
Baker does neither.
  Negative
And the tonal balancing act of The Florida Project is the main thing that makes it so breathtaking.
  Positive
We basically journey through the day-to-day life of a wide-eyed, funny, creative kid, the kind who puts a dead fish in the pool to bring it back to life and turns off the power to the entire motel just to see what happens.
  Neutral
Theres nothing overly special about Moonee or her life in typical movie ways.
  Negative
Every day is a bit of an adventure for Moonee, but Baker is careful not to romanticize that at the same time.
  Neutral
He recognizes that Moonee is kind of a unique kid, the sort who can get a kick out of making noises into an oscillating fan or brushing her dolls hair in the tub, but he never makes her into a precocious Hollywood cliche of the wide-eyed innocent.
  Positive
Moonee knows the deal.
  Positive
She knows more than most adults around her.
  Positive
But she wants to have fun everyday.
  Positive
Of course, it helps Baker greatly that he found a future star in Brooklynn Prince, who gives one of the best child performances in years.
  Positive
Shes so genuine that you forget that Moonee is a character, falling completely into her life as if its true.
  Positive
As The Florida Project progresses, we realize that Moonees mother Halley  Bria Vinaite is sliding away socially and economically.
  Negative
She struggles to make the rent, cant get a job, and sells perfume in the parking lots of the fancier hotels in Orlando.
  Negative
Its not adding up to enough to keep her family fed or a roof over their head.
  Negative
Someone else who senses that Halley and Moonee are good people on slippery terrain is the hotel manager Bobby, played perfectly by  Willem Dafoe.
  Negative
In a long, very notable career, this is one of Dafoes best performances.
  Positive
Like Moonees story, Bobbys appearances in the film are often episodic, but Dafoe uses these little beats to create a fully three-dimensional character.
  Negative
He has seen dozens of Moonees and Halleys come through his motel, and yet he cant quite completely detach from the human lives in the rooms he rents.
  Negative
It is a perfectly modulated, beautiful piece of work.
  Very positive
What first feels episodic in the structure of The Florida Project becomes something more of a statement about the repetition of ordinary lives.
  Negative
We see Moonee do so many things multiple times get breakfast from her mothers best friends restaurant, get ice cream from a nearby establishment, hustle tourists to sell perfume, etc. and it becomes a very effective way to add realism to Bakers film.
  Negative
Even Bobby is shown pecking away at his keyboard or remodeling the motel multiple times.
  Negative
Theres no romanticism of these lives, and yet theres never a sense of drudgery either.
  Negative
Its a breathtaking balance of the two that really makes the movie work, and it culminates in a final scene of striking beauty the kind that you dont soon forget.
  Very positive
Some of our greatest films achieve their greatness by presenting us with characters who feel completely fully-realized and three-dimensional.
  Positive
We feel like we know Chiron from Moonlight or Lee from  Manchester by the Sea.
  Negative
Moonee, Hailey, and Bobby achieve the same kind of life beyond the film about them.
  Negative
Its enough to make you want to slow down the next time you pass a place like the Magic Castle and look more closely at the lives unfolding there.
  Negative
It takes a very special movie to change the way we look at the people around us.
  Positive
The Florida Project is a very special movie.
