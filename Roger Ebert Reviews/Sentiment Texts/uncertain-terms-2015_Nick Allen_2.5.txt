While some filmmakers desire to fill their authorship with resplendent narratives and painstaking characters, director  Nathan Silver wants whats underneath, above, and in-between all that.
  Negative
In his own words from a guest post for Filmmaker Magazine in : The plots of my movies dont matter - I want whats in the air I can only make movies about air, really.
  Negative
Depending on what you expect from a film, thats either the declaration of a wild man with a movie camera, or something that rings with the same nothingness as a Ziploc bag filled with air from a  Kanye West show.
  Negative
Nonetheless, Silvers latest film Uncertain Terms finds some substance within its ideology of evaporated ambitions, though theres plenty of empty space in which the film is still able to limit itself.
  Negative
Based on a story co-written with  Chloe Domont and cinematographer  Cody Stokes, Uncertain Terms is the low-fi observance of a person looking for a type of home in an atypical domestic scenario, a set-up that has intrigued Silver in previous -minute features Exit Elena  and s Soft in the Head.
  Negative
In this tale, the misplaced focal character is Robbie played by  David Dahlbom, cinematographer of Exit Elena, who ventures to the house belonging to his aunt Carla played by  Cindy Silver, mother of Nathan, which is a shelter for pregnant teens.
  Negative
While serving as low-key handyman for the property, Robbie tries to clear his head of his recent marital trauma.
  Negative
His wife, Mona, cheated on him.
  Negative
Haunting him through a barrage of texts and voicemails, she desperately wants him back.
  Negative
While embroiled in this angst, Robbie begins to particularly enjoy the warming company of Nina, one of the shelters guests who has relationship issues of her own.
  Negative
Her boyfriend Chase  Casey Drogin is a directionless dum-dum, who only confirms Ninas uncertain future as to how shell take care of her newborn, and with whose support.
  Negative
Robbie and Ninas brief interactions, friendly but intimate, incites jealousy in fellow teen Jean  Tallie Medel, who showed initial interest in Robbie despite his polite deflections.
  Negative
Though glacially paced, Uncertain Terms benefits from its sense of stakes, in which it finds characters right before their lives are about to completely change maybe Robbie and Nina will be able to do so together.
  Positive
The shared emotional angst of a cheated husband doesnt compute equally with the encompassing stress of an unwanted teen pregnancy, but thats a hooking character flaw of self-righteousness within Dahlboms Robbie that makes him most interesting.
  Negative
Though hes trying to pull everything together, hes hit a peak of recklessness, projecting upon a young woman who has plenty of her own personal business to deal with.
  Positive
In Uncertain Terms"' unique brand of bizarre, this is some finite poetry about that self-destructive period in the aftermath of a relationships implosion.
  Negative
Silvers filmmaking has always been quite the haven for naturalistic performances, this time expressing the promise of female leads Menuez and Medel.
  Very positive
Whats bothersome about Uncertain Terms is how the other women in the shelter are treated, especially with the storys openly economical sense about soaking in its environment.
  Positive
Aside from the aforementioned two, the other young women in the shelter are walking back-stories more than they are characters, used for scenes of sharing their unintended pregnancies more than glimpses of who they are as flesh-and-blood beings.
  Negative
The films admirable intentions to provide a non-taboo presentation of pregnant teens without the protective quirk of s  Juno or the tidy religiosity of s Gimme Shelter are nearly undone by editing that takes away their personality.
  Negative
A lining issue in his authorship, Silvers interests in the reflexes within intimate interaction are often too stubborn to find truth beyond such reenactments of real life.
  Negative
Still, this film has a narrative feat that cant go overlooked, one thats certainly better executed than the Bradley Cooper-Emma Stone pairing in  Cameron Crowes recent  Aloha.
  Positive
Silvers Uncertain Terms is able to fully bond two characters with a vivid, kind-of inappropriate relationship thats hard to wrap ones head around when first billowing, but becomes validated once denouement proclamations show it to be of sincere desperation.
  Negative
The gut-feeling power within Robbie and Ninas unique connection can be felt in a scene in which he confides in her his perspective on falling in love young' how youve got to grow together with someone and you grow yourself, and change yourself to fit this other person.
  Positive
If thats taken away, its even harder to start over.
  Negative
Its a moment that shows a distinct grasp of filmmaking mojo even if concludes with Silvers emblematic shrugging cynicism.
  Neutral
It also declares that Silvers perspective is not so much a definitive answer to truth in storytelling, but a miss-miss-hit tactic in which desires of precision are voided for the breaths that will undoubtedly have more matter than than others.
  Negative
Contrary to Silvers airy aspirations, it nudges towards the idea that film is more about what we can take away from the atmospheres in which directors place us.
  Negative
