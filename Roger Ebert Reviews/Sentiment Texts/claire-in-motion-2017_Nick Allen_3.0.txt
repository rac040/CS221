You could program a great double feature with the two films directed so far by  Annie J. Howell amp'  Lisa Robinson.
  Positive
Their first movie, 's  Small, Beautifully Moving Parts was a sunny SXSW selection about a pregnant womantech-geek trying to track down her estranged mother in order to get some answers about motherhood.
  Positive
Their latest feature, Claire in Motion, is of a similar interest but with a distinct change in tone: the missing person is the title characters husband, and the questions that art professor Claire has about his whereabouts, or his past, may never be answered.
  Positive
With their second success, Howell amp' Robinson continue to treat mainstream log-lines with unique emotional and intellectual tenderness, offering a fresh take on our inherent need for closure.
  Positive
Betsy Brandt gives a compelling performance as the title character whose spirit is slowly breaking, a woman of the arts faced with a painful and personal manifestation of ambiguity.
  Negative
It is not long into the story in which the search is called off for Paul, as a policeman tells her that he very well could have fallen down a crevice in the woods, and theres no sense in risking lives to find out.
  Negative
She tries to have some type of control of her sanity, which she later calls a means of survival.
  Neutral
Later with a friend, she talks about art and Pauls disappearance as if they were the same thing: Theres so much uncertainty, and were immersed in it.
  Negative
With a quiet helplessness, as articulated strongly by Brandt, she keeps prodding the mystery, taking her son  Zev Haworth out to the woods where he disappeared in hopes of finding something, or watching an iPad video he made of her, where some marital tension is apparent.
  Negative
Whatever clarity she does find is then obscured by the presence of an affable art student named Alison  Anna Margaret Hollyman, the lead in Small, Beautifully Moving Parts, who is completely new to Claire but knows a lot about Paul, and has even made elaborate art pieces with him.
  Positive
This becomes a key part of the story, but Howell amp' Robinson treat the other woman story thread with vital nuance.
  Positive
They highlight how Alison is an ideological and social opposite, which might mean nothing, or it might mean everything.
  Negative
Alison takes on the world with openness, and that very attitude can make her over-share what shes thinking to Claire, all in a bungled attempt at being self-aware.
  Positive
Like when Alison shuts down the possibly adulterous elephant in the room early on, she makes things worse in part because of a simple, very human flaw of communication.
  Negative
We dont know for sure if Alison is telling the truth, but we recognize how she might be trying very hard to do so.
  Negative
As the mystery about Paul persists,Claire occupies a crushing emotional purgatory.
  Positive
Howell amp' Robinson accompany this with a thickly overcast color palette, which becomes a sustainable narrative element however slow the story may go.
  Negative
As it fittingly immerses the viewer in uncertainty, the desaturated world of Claire in Motion can leave a mark.
  Negative
It becomes a ghostly work, about a woman haunted by a loss more vicious than death.
  Negative
Howell amp' Robinsons film so craftily resists expectation that its more common visual tropes visions of Paul that are obviously dreams can hold the story back.
  Negative
But theres just enough energy in atmosphere and performance within Claire in Motion, as with "Small, Beautifully Moving Parts," that theyallow the viewer to settle in and dig deep.
  Positive
I hope we get to see more from them soon.
  Neutral
