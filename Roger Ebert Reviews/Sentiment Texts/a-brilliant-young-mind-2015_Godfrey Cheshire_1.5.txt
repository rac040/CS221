The title of  Morgan Matthews A Brilliant Young Mind all too obviously echoes that of  Ron Howards  A Beautiful Mind, but although both films concern mentally challenged mathematics prodigies, they are otherwise almost exact opposites: where the  multiple Oscar winner offered a compendium of Hollywood moviemaking strengths, this BBC Films import mainly serves up TV-style triteness and warmed-over clichs.
  Negative
The new work belongs to that large group of films whose makers seem to assume they derive some benefit from assuring us that their fiction is based on true events.
  Positive
In this case, whats meant is that it derives from a documentary previously directed by Matthews, Beautiful Young Minds, about a group of students preparing for the International Mathematics Olympiad IMO.
  Positive
From  Jeffrey Blitzs  Spellbound on, kids-in-competitive-mind-sports films have become a documentary mini-genre unto themselves.
  Negative
And it may be that documentary is the best form for such stories, since no matter how many fictional tropes are used to shape them, they have the authenticity of showing us real people in actual situations.
  Positive
Replace those with made-up characters and invented conflicts and too often whats most fascinating about the real material gets drowned in predictable dramatic contrivances.
  Neutral
Thats what happens in A Brilliant Young Mind, which is based on a clich-clotted script by  James Graham.
  Negative
Weve barely been introduced to young Nathan Ellis played as a nine-year-old by Edward Baker-Close and his dad  Martin McCann, when the two jump into the family car and dad is killed in a collision.
  Negative
As the film keeps reminding us thereafter, dad was Nathans main emotional support, since he believed his introverted sons fascination with primary numbers made him special rather than odd.
  Negative
Lacking that support, and getting no similar comprehension from his eager-but-clueless mom Julie  Sally Hawkins, Nathans at loose ends till he finds a mentor in Martin  Rafe Spall, a teacher who understands his abilities and potential achievements as a math whiz.
  Negative
Naturally, since convention dictates that characters like this must have a troubled back story, Martins an alcoholic due to having botched the IMO himself years before.
  Negative
Once the story skips forward a few years, Nathan played as a teenager by  Asa Butterfield enters Act Two ready to ship off for an IMO-preparatory summer camp in Taiwan, where the U.K. kids are chaperoned by a focused, hard-charging teacher named Richard  Eddie Marsan.
  Negative
In Taipei, it becomes evident that the main competition for the Brits will come from the Chinese kids all of whom, conveniently enough, seem to speak good English.
  Negative
For Nathan, this development gains a personal dimension when he begins to show incipient romantic interest in a female Chinese student,  Jo Yang  Zhang Mei.
  Negative
Linguistic note: The film and its press notes identify the actress surname-first, in traditional fashion, but do the opposite for her character.
  Negative
No explanation is given for this, though perhaps English-speakers are presumed to expect the characters given name to come first.
  Negative
Of the many things that make A Brilliant Young Mind unsatisfying, arguably the most salient is that the assertion of its title defies dramatization.
  Negative
Nathan is brilliant?
  Positive
Well, if he were a footballer or a spelling-bee champ, we could see his skill as it evolved and played out.
  Negative
But since most filmgoers are not mathematics geniuses, the competition here must be reduced to furrowed brows, flurries of numbers flashed across the screen, and occasional swatches of unintelligible math-speech.
  Negative
More dramatically problematic, though, is that, with one exception, Nathans relationships with people go nowhere.
  Negative
Whether its his mother, his father, his mentor, or his fellow students, theres virtually no difference in how they relate to him between the first time we see them and the last.
  Negative
The one exception, slight but pleasing nonetheless, is Nathan and Jos teen-crush.
  Positive
As in other scripts with this weakness, a lack of dramatic development results in a great deal of narrative padding: throughout, the film flashes back to child-Nathans interaction with his dad, or to Martin wrestling with his alcoholism, scenes which do absolutely nothing to advance the story but end up making the film, at  minutes, feel lumpy and overlong.
  Negative
These flaws also have a negative impact on the films acting.
  Negative
Hawkins, a truly delightful performer in most circumstances, and Butterfield are both reduced to one-note performances due to the limitations of their characters as written: shes got a single expression of chirpy eagerness, whereas his adolescent angst produces a single downcast look.
  Positive
Much better are Marsden and Zhang, who enliven their characters with a freshness and energy the protagonist lacks.
  Neutral
For his part, Spall falls somewhere between: hes got screen presence galore, though his character never gets beyond the two-dimensional.
  Positive
Director Matthews has previously directed documentaries and A Brilliant Young Mind is his first foray into dramatic territory.
  Positive
Not surprisingly, his visuals have little compositional rigor or distinction, but often seem to stand at a middle distance in order to allow the actors room to move.
  Negative
No doubt hell expand and refine his stylistic vocabulary if he continues to work in drama, and, with luck, discovers better scripts.
  Negative
