Gia Coppola, the -year-old granddaughter of  Francis Ford Coppola and niece of  Sofia Coppola, makes her directorial debut with "Palo Alto."
  Negative
Coppola also wrote the screenplay, adapting  James Franco's short story collection of the same name.
  Negative
Franco was instrumental in helping get the film made, for, despite her last name, it was not easy for Coppola to find financing for the film, especially since there are no A-list stars in it and many of the young actors are newbies to the industry.
  Very negative
Shooting on a very low budget, "Palo Alto" is a sensitively-filmed the cinematographer was  Autumn Durald and dreamy-looking evocation of a group of aimless teenagers, usually stoned or drunk, circulating in a mainly adult-free world in the notoriously wealthy town of the title.
  Negative
"Palo Alto" is a very strong first feature, prioritizing mood over message.
  Positive
Coppola does not diagnose underlying societal problems' she does not make assumptions about the cultural void in which the kids live.
  Negative
She just shows us what they do, moving in and out of different narratives, interspersed with moody, misty shots of a mainly-empty-looking Palo Alto street lamps at night, quiet playgrounds, sunset hitting the tree tops.
  Negative
It all feels a little bit like a dream, like the characters will look back on it and think, "Did it really happen like that?
  Negative
Or was I just stoned the whole time?"
  Neutral
The main characters are Teddy, played by newcomer  Jack Kilmer, son of  Val Kilmer, who has a funny cameo as a perpetually stoned, video-game-playing stepdad.
  Positive
Teddy is a good kid who likes to draw and has a crush on soccer-playing April  Emma Roberts.
  Positive
He drinks to excess, and one night crashes his car while drunk, getting himself a stint of community service at a children's library.
  Negative
Teddy's best friend is the volatile Fred an excellent  Nat Wolff.
  Positive
Fred is an aggressive, combative, troubled kid when you meet his father, played with beautiful creepiness by  Chris Messina, you get a glimpse of the origin of Fred's problems.
  Negative
Fred picks fights, treats girls horribly, and seems, somehow, dangerous.
  Negative
April, played by Roberts, is shy and serious, and has a crush on her soccer coach Mr. B. played by James Franco.
  Positive
Mr. B. is a good coach, but he also has this way of maintaining eye contact with April in a way that seems...too much, too intense.
  Negative
April babysits for Mr. B.'s young son.
  Neutral
Lastly, there is the fascinating Emily  Zoe Levin, an isolated girl, beautiful and blonde, who services every boy in the class as though she has been hired for the job, and yet says at one point, with eerie blankness, "I've never been in love."
  Positive
These four narratives shift and merge, dissecting and diverging.
  Positive
Parents don't really "count" in this world.
  Neutral
April's Botoxed-mother hovers around her daughter in the kitchen, hugging her, saying "I love you so much!"
  Positive
It feels anxious rather than sincere.
  Negative
The guidance counselor at the school is useless, with dead plants filling up her makeshift office.
  Negative
Mr. B. clearly has a thing for teenage girls, and April falls under his sway for a time.
  Negative
It's exciting for her.
  Positive
At the same time that he is flirting with her after hours, he stops encouraging her at soccer practice, stops speaking to her at school.
  Negative
His behavior is hurtful and manipulative.
  Negative
During one of their encounters, there are insert shots of parts of April's face her lips, her eyes, covered in bands of shadow, a beautiful editorial choice on Coppola's part, showing the dissociation going on for April in a purely visual way.
  Positive
Clearly, the kids lack role models, but they don't even seem to know they need them.
  Negative
College is still far off.
  Negative
There are repeated, connected shots of each kid doing whatever it is that they do when they're alone: dancing around in their messy rooms, playing guitar, texting, smoking all of the kids smoke like chimneys, etc.
  Negative
Teddy's crush on April is sweet, and recognizably human, at least in contrast to the debauchery seen in the rest of the school, but the two of them don't know how to access those softer feelings.
  Positive
They are clearly drawn to one another.
  Positive
It makes them shy' it makes them not know what to say.
  Negative
All of the young actors here are amazing in their respective roles.
  Very positive
And while Teddy and April feel like the "leads," Emily and Fred, more troubled, more damaged, haunt the periphery, making you wonder, truly, what the hell is going to become of these two individuals?
  Negative
"Palo Alto" has a contemplative feel of darkness and languor, and the score is woven beautifully into the action.
  Very positive
The music feels like an integral part of the mood of the film, as opposed to indie hits being imposed on the narrative from the outside.
  Negative
"Palo Alto" is not like other, current films about teens, films that ache with hopelessness and alienating nihilism.
  Negative
"Palo Alto" sees the sweetness that is there, too, struggling to express itself, and to survive.
  Negative
