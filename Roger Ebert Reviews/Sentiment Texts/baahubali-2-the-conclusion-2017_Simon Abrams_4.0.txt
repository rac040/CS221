Behold, the first great summer film: athree-hour action-adventure about  a leader whose heroic deeds make Conan the Barbarian look like a wimp.
  Positive
The Indian actionperiod epic "Baahubali : The Conclusion" is everything I want but rarely get from superhero and big-budget fantasy movies.
  Negative
Here, larger-than-life characters specifically abeloved warrior-king Amarendra Baahubali Prabhas and his jealous cousin Bhalla  Rana Daggubati fight for the Mashimathithrone whiledeclaiming dramatically,flying intothin air, impaling or beheading their enemies, then singing about their exploits.
  Negative
Thanks to blessedly short flashbacks and fittingly bombastic expository dialogue, viewers of "Baahubali : The Conclusion" don't need to have seen the previous film to know what's at stake.
  Very negative
Better still: the action choreography is exciting, the operatic plot is compelling, and a genuine sense of optimism undercuts the geysers of blood and thunderous sound effects that accompanythe film's stirring set pieces.
  Very positive
Here's a splashy, big-budget film with an infectious sense of momentum that wins you over any time key plot points are glossed overfor the sake of establishing the next big confrontation.
  Positive
It's loud, it's gory, and there are musical numbers.
  Negative
One suresign of quality: despite some seriously ostentatious moralizing, "Baahubali " is inspired enough to make you care about characters who are as morally upstanding as Biblical figures and as relatable as refugees from a children's fairy tale.
  Positive
Sure,Amarendra possessessuperhumanstrength, agility, and filial piety like many men in Indian movies,he worshipshis mom.
  Negative
That's only because right initially seems tomake might in this universe.
  Negative
But as the movie goes on, it becomes clear that, despite good intentions writ large through Frank Capra-worthy speeches even the best people can be manipulated into committing crimes against each other.
  Negative
This is true of Bhalla, an innocent character whose natural jealousy is manipulated into hating his cousin by his pettyfather Bijjaladeva Nassar.
  Negative
And it's eventually alsotrue of both Baahubali's mother Sivagami  Ramya Krishnan and uncleadviser Kattappa Sathyaraj.
  Negative
It's refreshing to see thesecharacters, who are often seemingly painted as paragons of virtue and vice, have their wills tested by various trials and sometimes fail.
  Positive
These momentary weaknesses sometimes indicate character flaws, as in Bhalla'scase.
  Negative
But they also sometimessuggest that good people can make bigmistakes.
  Positive
The film's refusal to judge character solely based on how they respond to mitigating circumstancesis refreshing.
  Positive
So is the fact that both Sivagami and Baahubali's devotedwifeDevasena  Anushka Shetty have more than a token amount of influence and power throughout the film.
  Positive
They fight alongside Baahubali as he struggles to remainunmoved by the promiseof power the throne!
  Negative
while also not looking weak in front of his treacherous brother or his manipulative uncle.Prabhas's character isn't justadmirable because of his Herculeanfeats of physical strength, but because of his ability to make Solomon-like judgment calls beforehe masterfullyglares at the camera, makes a little speech, then soars into battle.
  Negative
And I do mean "soar."
  Positive
The fight scenes in "Baahubali " are so creative that they make even the most frequently abused creative shortcuts seem novel, everything from computer-generated imagery CGI to speed-ramping Zack Snyder's signature technique of speeding up, thenslowing down, then speeding up the tempo of a particularly action or physical motion.
  Negative
You care what happens to the castas, aided by wires, they hurl volleys of arrows at disposable minions and CGI animals.
  Negative
You haven't seen action scenes with physics and logic-defyingchoreography like this before.
  Negative
Baahubali breaks massive chains with a mallet, brushes off mortal wounds with one hand, and launches himself over castle walls with determination and deceptive ease.
  Negative
He is merciless on the warpath, devastating a legion of enemy soldiers by lashing them to a tree trunk that he places in the path of a lightning bolt.
  Negative
Baahubali's mom wields a severed head at one point.
  Negative
And did I mention that there's singing?Our heroes' actions are valorized through poetic, Greek chorus-like swooning that perfectly suits the film's paradoxicallyarch but playful tone.
  Positive
This is a refreshinglyirony-free depiction of demigod-like men and the values and family members they fight to protect.
  Positive
And for once in what feels like a long while, this type of old-fashionedentertainment works without feeling like a throwback or an homage to a preexisting work of pop art.
  Positive
I love "Baahubali ," partlybecause it never oncefelt like a soul-less, committee-assembled piece of entertainment.ManyAmerican viewers may wonder how a film that received little to no media coverage could surpass "The Circle,"a new studio-produced and distributed thrillerstarring  Tom Hanks and  Emma Watson, at the US box office.
  Neutral
But you only have to see "Baahubali " to know why it enjoyed such a fantastic opening weekend.
  Negative
It's grandiose and fun, and I pray there's a lot more where it came from.
  Positive
