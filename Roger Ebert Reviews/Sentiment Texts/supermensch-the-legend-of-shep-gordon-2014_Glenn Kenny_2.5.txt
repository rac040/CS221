  Negative
A kind of innate showbiz acumen leads Gordon to great innovations on his clients behalf he was the guy who planted the live chicken on stage at the infamous Alice Cooper gig that got the artist tagged as a poultry slayer, and by the -minute mark of the movie hes working the same magic for  Anne Murray and Teddy Pendergrass.

Director Myers is pretty deft at getting his aforementioned talking heads, which range from Stallone to Legase to the personal attach to the Dalai Lama, to make sense of Gordons eclecticism.
  Negative
The movie is like sitting at a restaurant with a guy whos got some of the best stories youve heard in your life provided, that is, that youre into stories about showbiz.
  Negative
Gordon, it can never be said enough, has met andor done business with anyone who was ever anyone, and in some peculiar ways he and  Cary Grant had a joint custody arrangement concerning a housecat.

Gordons genius at showmanship among other things, he pioneered the "For Ladies Only" concerts that shot Ramp'B love man Pendergrass career into the stratosphere is, per this portrait, matched only by his menschiness.

Gordon, who has a distinct speaking style and infectious laugh, speaks of his philosophy of "compassionate business" as he recounts, with confidence but some modesty, how he put the business affairs of Groucho Marx in order.

  Positive
Its pretty entertaining and at times almost educational Gordons account of how, and why, he created the category of celebrity chef is a short course in modern-day branding, for better or worse.
  Negative
The movies nutritional value, documentary wise, is pretty dubious in other respects, though' youngsters watching this are likely to come away with the impression that Alice Cooper was always a solo act rather than the front man of a band, none of the other members of which make an appearance here.
