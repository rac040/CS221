The word legend is one that is arguably thrown around too often in any context, but its no stretch at all to call Japanese movie star  Toshiro Mifune legendary.
  Negative
Or iconic for that matter.
  Neutral
The star of some of the greatest films ever made never mind nation or genre, just GREATEST FILMS EVER MADE the man was an exacting, electrifying performer.
  Positive
In documenting and celebrating his life and his films, youd have to go very far wrong indeed to come out of the effort with something bad or uninteresting.
  Negative
That said, Mifune: The Last Samurai, a documentary on the actor directed by  Steven Okazaki and narrated by  Keanu Reeves the script is by Okazaki and  Stuart Galbraith IV got off on a somewhat bad foot for me.
  Negative
Explaining Mifunes place in the firmament of pop culture, the narration says of his collaborations with director  Akira Kurosawa, without them there would have been no Magnificent Seven.
  Negative
This is factually true but seems to me to throw out a very crucial baby with the bathwater.
  Negative
What makes Kurosawa and Mifune crucial is that without them there would be no Seven Samurai.
  Negative
But the fact of the matter is that Im not the key demo for this movie.
  Negative
Mifune: The Last Samurai wasnt made for fans like me.
  Positive
Although fans like me will likely be the first in line to see it.
  Positive
After explaining Mifunes importance, the movie lays out a brief history of Japanese cinema, the chanbara swordplay movie in particular.
  Negative
Only then does it get to Mifunes fascinating life: Born in  to parents who set up business in China, he only sets foot in Japan at age , to fight in World War II.
  Negative
That experience was traumatic, but not in a conventional way.
  Negative
Harboring no ambitions to act, he tries to follow a bit in his photographer fathers footsteps by apprenticing as a camera assistant at a film studio.
  Negative
His good looks, simultaneously rugged and smooth get him noticed, and so    What the movie is very good at revealing and expanding upon is how this reluctant actor became such a masterful one.
  Positive
In part it was due to his presence.
  Positive
Hes not an actor who blends into the background, one of his surviving colleagues notes.
  Negative
In part it was due to what his life experience taught him.
  Neutral
His experience made him determined, one interviewee notes, to never again be the kind of person who bends to authority.
  Negative
But it was also, eventually, his devotion and his research.
  Positive
His frequent costar and friend  Yoshio Tsuchiya notes The one word I would use to describe Mifune is perseverance!
  Negative
Mifune put himself through a lot.
  Neutral
He was a heavy drinker whose alcohol abuse ended up affecting his family life.
  Negative
His oldest son nevertheless remembers his fathers great compassion.
  Positive
The movie concentrates mostly on Mifunes collaboration with Kurosawa, which yielded great pictures such as the groundbreaking  Rashomon, Samurai, The Hidden Fortress,  Yojimbo, and  Red Beard.
  Negative
While it does not dig deep on what ended their collaboration  Martin Scorsese, also known as a director with a compelling long-term relationship with a single actor, now dormant, offers some fascinating rumination on the subject, its account of a sort of long-distance reconciliation is very moving.
  Positive
The movies clips are thrilling, and apt.
  Positive
While I commend Mifune: The Last Samurai for its briskness, and its occasional crowd-pleasing playfulness as when it introduces viewers to the actor who put on the rubber suit to play Godzilla the same year he was a samurai in Kurosawas classic its a movie I myself could have stood to see more of.
  Negative
Fascinating MifuneKurosawa collaborations such as  Stray Dog and The Idiot are given short shrift if mentioned at all.
  Negative
When going into Mifunes international career, his role in Hell In The Pacific, in which he goes one-on-one with another iconlegend,  Lee Marvin, is given the briefest of mentions.
  Negative
Last I looked, that movies director  John Boorman is both alive and as voluble as ever.
  Positive
And so on.
  Neutral
Again, these quibbles arise from the fact that this is a beginners guide, not a fest for fans.
  Negative
Is it too much to expect an expanded DVD edition though?
  Negative
