How odd that The  Imitation  Game, one of the more rousingly entertaining crowd-pleasers coming  out this holiday season as endorsed by its Peoples Choice Award at  the Toronto film festival also happens to be one of the most  devastatingly sad.
  Negative
On  one hand, this is a tense World War II thriller about a stellar team of  Brits who cracked Nazi Germanys Enigma code.
  Negative
The movie boasts its own  inspirational rallying cry, repeated three times in case you miss it,  which would be perfect for embossing on a holly-bedecked greeting card:  Sometimes, it is the people no one imagines anything of who do the  things that no one imagines.
  Very negative
On  the other hand, it is an examination of the tragic circumstances that  befell Alan Turing, the films central hero, who brings victory to the  Allies by inventing a revolutionary machine that would give birth to the  computer age.
  Negative
He would later be publicly vilified and savagely punished  for engaging in homosexual activity, which was criminalized in  England at the time, before committing suicide in .
  Negative
Instead  of being festooned with a chest full of medals, the closeted genius who  saved countless lives by significantly shortening the war was cruelly  subjected to chemically-induced castration in lieu of jail time.
  Negative
And,  because much of the details were kept classified for  years, few knew  of the extent of his wartime feats, even though he was awarded the Order  of the British Empire for his services in .
  Negative
He was officially  pardoned of his offenses by Queen Elizabeth in  a case of too  little too late.
  Negative
This  atypical biopic about the brilliant, impossibly arrogant and socially  awkward mathematician played by  Benedict Cumberbatch, impeccably  perfect in every way is a somewhat hard read at first.
  Negative
Most likely, it  was the intent of screenwriter  Graham Moore to make a puzzle out a film  about puzzle solving.
  Neutral
That is not necessarily a bad thing, however,  once the pieces fall into in place.
  Negative
The fractured narrative starts off  as a mystery in  with a detective investigating a burglary at  Turings home where, strangely, nothing was stolen.
  Negative
Eventually, the  plot flashes back to  and shifts into a heart-breaking love story as  a teen Turing, a brutally bullied school-boy prodigy, chastely falls  for a fellow classmate named Christopher.
  Negative
But The  Imitation  Game is most on its game when it primarily sticks to being a John le  Carre-lite espionage version of Revenge of the Nerds, beginning in   as it introduces a battleground of the mind that relies on superior  intellect rather than bombs to beat the enemy.
  Negative
Norwegian director  Morten Tyldum in his English-language debut provides just enough science  to explain what is at stake while escalating the beat-the-clock tension  involved in the mission conducted by Turing and a handful of other  high-IQ cohorts.
  Neutral
Alexandre Desplats hauntingly propulsive score further  enhances the suspense while capturing the gravity of the situation.
  Positive
It  might seem a no-brainer to hire Cumberbatch for the job of bringing  Turing to life.
  Negative
After all, what other actor these days is as well-suited  to emblemize an aloof smarty-pants?
  Negative
Sorry,  Robert Downey Jr.
  Positive
The  torch has been passed.
  Negative
Instead of constantly reminding Sherlock fans  of his Emmy-winning role as the Arthur Conan Doyles master of  deduction, Cumberbatch has broken his own code of how to distinguish  this particular eccentric genius as a completely separate but yet no  less compelling entity.
  Negative
To  portray Turing, Cumberbatchs seductive purr is less mellifluous, his  lips are slightly pursed, his gaze is often averted and, despite his  unwavering confidence in his thinking skills, there is an air of  vulnerability and melancholy about him.
  Negative
But, like Sherlock, Turing is given to verbal dust-ups that often end  amusingly, especially with such haughty superiors as the uncompromising  Commander Denniston a superb  Charles Dance, whose patrician nose  practically rears up in disgust whenever his by-the-book overlord  encounters Cumberbatchs defiant whiz.
  Negative
Turing also has his protector in   Mark Strongs head of intelligence, who calmly, coolly and with a sly  wink runs interference for his not-exactly-diplomatic secret weapon at  every turn.
  Negative
As  for the rest of the code breakers,  Matthew Goode stands out as a  caddish chess champ Hugh Alexander, who initially butts heads with  Turing until he realizes the depth of his abilities.
  Negative
On board as John  Cairncross is  Allen Leech, best known as Branson the Irish  chauffeur-turned-terrorist-turned aristocrat on Downton Abbey, who is the most tolerant of Turings idiosyncrasies.
  Negative
If  anyone comes close to matching Cumberbatchs efforts, however, it is  Keira Knightley.
  Negative
She brings a much-needed warmth, humor and Anglicized  spunk to the proceedings as Joan Clarke, immediately winning over the  audiences affections when she is mistakenly pegged as a secretarial  candidate while trying out for a code-breaking position.
  Positive
Clarke is as  much of an odd duck as Turing and perhaps even brighter as the lone  female involved in deciphering Enigma.
  Negative
Since it is considered  indecorous for a single woman to work and share living quarters  alongside men, she must sneak about to contribute to the effort.
  Negative
Some  of the best scenes involve Clarke and Turing, who confide in one  another as equals especially since both must hide their true  identities.
  Negative
One of the more meaningful moments arrives when Turing  jealously watches as Clarke immediately charms Alexander, a shameless  pickup artist.
  Positive
When Turing asks her how she so easily made him like her,  Clarke replies with Knightleys posh accent, Im a woman in a mans  job.
  Negative
I dont have the luxury of being an ass.
  Negative
The "like you" at the end  of that sentence is implied, of course.
  Negative
Matters  turn slightly hokey as the final solution to Enigma code relies on  several By Jove, Ive got it revelations.
  Negative
But, by then, you will  likely be fully invested in the outcome, no matter how out of left field  it might seem.
  Negative
Some of Cumberbatchs most affecting work is when the  older and close-to-defeated Turing is at the end of his rope, unable to  even focus on a crossword puzzle because of the drugs he has been given.
  Negative
But as I sit here typing away, I realize I have Turing to thank for  being able to access a wealth of information with just a few key strokes  and a click of a mouse.
  Negative
Not only did Turing help save the world, he continues to influence it every day.
  Positive
