Coming-of-age stories told from a girl's perspective tend to go a couple of predictable ways: A girl expresses her sexuality and disaster ensues, leading to promiscuity, drug use, pregnancy, hooking up under the freeway, etc.
  Negative
Or, the story focuses on the "first love" aspect, the explosion of intense emotions and hormones, bathed in the lens flare of nostalgia.
  Neutral
But what about a story where a girl explores her sexuality with enthusiasm just like a boy would, and disaster does NOT ensue?
  Neutral
Those stories are harder to come by, although they are out there.
  Neutral
"Diary of a Teenage Girl," from first-time writerdirector  Marielle Heller based on the novel by  Phoebe Gloeckner, is one of those stories.
  Positive
It's a refreshing, and, sadly, rare take on a girl coming into her own.
  Positive
Once Minnie played by  Bel Powley, in a major performance discovers how great sex is, she wants more of it.
  Positive
Her choices are not always smart she's only , her partner is wildly inappropriate for her not to mention illegal, but Heller has spoken about how she wanted to allow for complexity.
  Neutral
The result is a film that is funny and sad, scary and sweet, disturbing and revelatory.
  Very positive
"Diary of a Teenage Girl" starts with Minnie walking through the park with a triumphant smile on her face.
  Positive
She says in voiceover, "I had sex today...Holy shit!"
  Neutral
She smiles at strangers, people picnicking, throwing a Frisbee around, and the whole world seems beautiful.
  Positive
It's San Francisco in the mid-s.
  Neutral
The times are loose, the mood is wild.
  Positive
Minnie's mother  Kristen Wiig, in yet another performance that proves she can do anything is bitter and narcissistic, raising two daughters alone, as she parties, does drugs, and cavorts through a laissez-faire relationship with Monroe  Alexander Skarsgrd.
  Very negative
Minnie, absorbing the seething adult sexuality around her, is curious about sex, and eggs Monroe on to take her virginity.
  Positive
Which he promptly does, with only token resistance.
  Negative
Here is where many viewers will put on the brakes.
  Negative
Monroe is in his s, involved with Minnie's mother, and Minnie is still a minor.
  Negative
But as the title suggests, this is a story told from Minnie's point of view.
  Negative
You could look at Minnie's pursuit of Monroe as a way of getting back at her mother, but Heller doesn't muddy up the waters with psychological explanations.
  Negative
It's enough to Minnie that Monroe is hot, he has a cool mustache, her hormones are raging, and Monroe doesn't turn her down when she comes on to him.
  Positive
There's a difference between portrayingbehavior and endorsingbehavior, but often movies and filmmakers get caught up in crossfires of controversy and confusion.
  Negative
Did "Wolf of Wall Street" endorse misogyny or was it a portrayal of a world where misogyny ran rampant?
  Negative
Did " Zero Dark Thirty" endorse torture?
  Negative
Or was it a story told from within the community that did not question torture's use?
  Neutral
When 's "Observe and Report" came out, a controversy ensued about one scene where Seth Rogen's character has sex with  Anna Faris, who is so wasted she is clearly unable to consent.
  Negative
The scene is disturbing, but it ends with a huge laugh, and therein was the problem.
  Positive
Did "Observe and Report" endorse date rape then?
  Negative
Where you come down on this issue is dependent on a lot of different factors, personal taste, politicalsocial opinions and your feelings on what role art should play in our culture.
  Negative
Some feel art needs to be inspirational or educational: Films have a responsibility to show the consequences of bad behavior.
  Negative
Films should portray the world as it shouldbe, not as it is.
  Neutral
A film is dangerous if it does not point an arrow at bad behavior telegraphing "Don't do this."
  Negative
There aren't any wrong answers, but the problem comes when the same set of criteria is used for all works of art.
  Negative
The purpose of the old ABC Afterschool Specials was to warn kids about the dangers that were out there.
  Negative
But are all films to be judged with the same set of rules?
  Neutral
Context matters.
  Neutral
"Diary of a Teenage Girl" is bound to stir up some controversy along these lines.
  Negative
Does it endorse a -year-old man sleeping with a -year-old?
  Neutral
Shouldn't she or he be made to "pay" for it in order to show the wrong-ness of the situation?
  Negative
But that opening scene, showing Minnie strolling through the sunshine, smiling to herself, loving the world, sets the mood and tells us the film's attitude towards the story that is about to unfold.
  Positive
In a less complex film, Monroe would be portrayed as a skeevy creep with no redeeming qualities.
  Negative
But Skarsgrd, a tremendously appealing actor, destabilizes that by bringing a sweetness to Monroe, and an almost childlike dissatisfaction with his life, all of which gets focused on the eager Minnie who latches onto him like a barnacle.
  Positive
The relationship is, of course, hugely imbalanced, manipulative on both sides, and emotionally explosive.
  Very positive
Monroe's behavior is, indeed, gross.
  Negative
For Minnie,the revelation that someone desires her almost literally blows her mind.
  Neutral
Heller and cinematographer  Brandon Trost create a gauzy golden-ish look, calling to mind faded photo albums, the mustard-yellows and pale-denim-blues of that era.
  Negative
The period is suggested, rather than fetishized.
  Negative
The music is atmospheric as opposed to a ready-made soundtrack, tunes coming out of jukeboxes, off record players, Minnie and her best friend jumping on the bed screaming along to The Stooges and drooling over a poster of  Iggy Pop.
  Negative
Minnie wants to be an artist, and is obsessed with the gigantic Amazon women populating the comics of Aline Kominsky-Crumb.
  Negative
Minnie dreams of clumping through the streets of San Francisco, towering over the buildings, a Crumb-comic come to life.
  Negative
Animated images unfurl around the action throughout the film: drawings come to life, little flowers burst into blossom around Minnie's head when she's happy, a sketch of Monroe starts to talk to her in a heartfelt way.
  Positive
The animation was done by the talented Sara Gunnarsdttir, and, similar to 's " The Motel Life," helps evoke the overheated emotions and sometimes delusional mindset of the protagonist.
  Negative
"Diary of a Teenage Girl" unravels slightly in its final sequences, featuring a couple of tangents that don't pour into the overall focus of the rest of the film.
  Positive
For the most part, though, "Diary of a Teenage Girl" is true to itself and its intentions.
  Positive
The characters are not betrayed by the plot, and vice versa.
  Negative
There are other films that have looked at coming-of-age from the girl's side of things.
  Neutral
William Inge's plays and screenplays in the s, fraught with repressed desire and terror of being labeled a "bad girl", were all about that.
  Negative
"Welcome to the Dollhouse" is in this realm, as are the films of  Francois Ozon and  Cline Sciamma.
  Negative
Nancy Savoca's " Dogfight" places the emotional and sexual journey of Rose  Lili Taylor on equal footing with that of Birdlace  River Phoenix, thereby avoiding the tiresome and sentimental manic-pixie-dream-girl formula. "
  Negative
Little Darlings," as silly as some of it was, took the sexual urges of teenage girls seriously, adding unpredictable elements of sharp poignancy.
  Positive
"Little Darlings" is kind to girls who want to have sex and to say that that is not usually the case is to understate the situation.
  Positive
When teenage girls exploring their sexuality and enjoying it like boys do is seen as radical, or disturbing, or gross, then there is an urgent need for films like "Diary of a Teenage Girl."
  Negative
