It  is a fascinating moment, fraught with promise, when this spirit of the  times, dozing pitifully and apathetically, like a huge wet bird on a  branch, suddenly and without a clear reason or at any rate without a  reason allowing of an entirely rational explanation, unexpectedly takes  off in bold and joyful flight.

  Negative
These are private matters, and yet they get  the attention of the Stasi, who can use it to blackmail Hoffman.

  Negative
Meno goes from a laughing, confident man to a ruined shell of  an individual, and it drives the tragic point home about what politics have done  to talented minds like Meno's.
