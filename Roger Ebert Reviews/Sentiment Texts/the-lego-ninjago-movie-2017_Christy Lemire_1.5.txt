The pieces are all there, but they never really snap into place in The LEGO Ninjago Movie.
  Negative
The feature-film version of the long-running animated TV series Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu only superficially resembles its source material, and it pales in comparison to its cinematic predecessors.
  Negative
Maybe such diminishing returns were inevitable.
  Negative
It would be impossible to recreate the groundbreaking, lightning-in-a-bottle innovation of s  The Lego Movie.
  Negative
We saw that earlier this year with the release of  The Lego Batman Movie, which was consistently zippy and amusing but, inevitably, not quite as novel.
  Negative
Now we have The LEGO Ninjago Movie, about a group of teenagers who are secretly ninjas, each with a special elemental power.
  Positive
Their challenge is to take on the evil Lord Garmadon voiced by  Justin Theroux, who also happens to be the father of the teams Green Ninja, Lloyd  Dave Franco.
  Negative
But while the film is credited to three directors  Charlie Bean,  Paul Fisher and  Bob Logan and a small army of writers, it results in only a few clever ideas that are chuckle-worthy, at best.
  Negative
Its strongest bit is the introduction of a live-action cat within this animated setting dubbed Meowthra in an homage to classic, Japanese movie monsters who terrorizes Ninjago City when shes accidentally summoned with a red laser pointer.
  Positive
But the enjoyment of the absurd sight of a cat knocking over Lego buildings lasts about as long as your average viral video and then youre stuck realizing how little there is to the script.
  Negative
Part of the problem is that The LEGO Ninjago Movie is primarily about Lloyd struggling with his daddy issues and Garmadon trying to figure out whether and how to be a father to Lloyd, whom he hasnt seen since the boys infancy.
  Negative
And aside from Lloyd, the other ninjas are essentially interchangeable, which is a huge departure from the television show.
  Negative
I have a son whos almost eight.
  Neutral
We watch a lot of Ninjago in this house.
  Negative
Ask me anything.
  Neutral
The supporting players names and nature-related abilities are all the same water, lightning, fire, etc. but they have no discerning personalities beyond that.
  Negative
They are background noise.
  Neutral
They are filler.
  Neutral
Whats so bizarre about that is that the longtime voice performers from the TV series whove been playing these characters for seven seasons now have all been replaced with better-known actors and comedians, who then get surprisingly little to do.
  Negative
Nothing against them theyre all great and theyre solid voice talent, people youre happy to see whether they appear in TV or film but theyre not given enough material to justify overhauling the entire cast.
  Positive
The shift seems like a cynical ploy to make the movie more marketable.
  Negative
For the record, they are  Kumail Nanjiani Jay,  Fred Armisen Cole,  Michael Pena Kai,  Abbi Jacobson Nya and  Zach Woods Zane.
  Negative
Jackie Chan plays their wise leader, Master Wu, and  Olivia Munn has a small supporting role as Lloyds mom, Koko.
  Positive
LEGO Ninjago also suffers from its live-action bookend narrative structure, featuring Chan as a store owner who tells the legend of Ninjago to a wide-eyed kid.
  Negative
All that does is explain the presence of the cat and it gets the films pacing off to a sluggish start from which it never fully recovers.
  Positive
What it could have used more of was world-building, literally and figuratively.
  Negative
What makes this place different from every other?
  Neutral
What makes it better than the world of The Lego Movie, where everything was awesome?
  Neutral
That movie efficiently and effectively laid out its parameters and characters.
  Positive
This one drops you in so if you dont know the show, youll have no connection to this setting.
  Negative
Having said that, if youre a fan of the show, youll be struck by how little the movie has in common with it.
  Negative
Despite the grander scale and bigger budget, the movie doesnt use the Legos for the thing that makes them fun: the building aspect of them, the possibility of creativity, the way they allow you to push boundaries and come up with structures and characters that maybe dont make any sense, but theyre cool-looking.
  Negative
LEGO Ninjago is essentially an ordinary animated film, with visuals rendered in Lego form.
  Negative
And sometimes the visuals are so garbled, this may as well be a  Transformers movie, especially as the ninjas climb inside their various mecha to flyclimbfightetc.
  Negative
against Garmadon to keep him from destroying Ninjago City.
  Neutral
Along those lines, the sound mix often made it hard to hear the quips, one-liners and banter, especially during the big action sequences, of which there are many.
  Negative
Then again, the jokes and the energy as a whole lack the infectious nature of previous Lego movies.
  Neutral
Since were making all the inevitable comparisons, its hard to shake the sensation that Theroux is essentially doing  Will Arnett doing Batman in the previous two Lego movies.
  Negative
He brings an amusing buffoonery to this alleged super-villain a clueless bravado, a total lack of self-awareness but weve heard this shtick before.
  Negative
Even the husky swagger of Therouxs delivery recalls Arnetts performances, and it serves as yet another reminder of how superior the predecessors were.
  Positive
And as my son pointed out after a screening of the film between bursts of singing the TV shows insanely catchy theme song the ninjas dont even do spinjitzu, their stylized martial-arts technique using their signature elemental powers.
  Negative
Not really not until the end.
  Negative
But maybe well see more of that in the sequel, which is certainly on the horizon, whether its merited or not.
