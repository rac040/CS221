Holden Caulfield hated phonies.
  Negative
He detested the superficial fantasies offered by Hollywood yet still yearned for the lost innocence of his youth.
  Negative
As the beloved teenage protagonist of J.D. Salingers  literary masterpiece, The Catcher in the Rye, Caulfield has always upstaged the enigmatic author who brought him to life.
  Positive
Danny Strongs Rebel in the Rye attempts to correct that by placing Salinger at the center of his own biopic, while utilizing  Kenneth Slawenskis  biography, J.D. Salinger: A Life, as its chief source material.
  Negative
This sounds like a promising approach at the outset, but the execution is riddled with problems, not the least of which is the absence of Salingers actual work.
  Neutral
We get fragmented excerpts of his text along with some wordless homages such as the novels iconic carousel, but no real sense of his genius.
  Negative
Jim Jarmuschs  Paterson masterfully demonstrated how the essence of William Carlos Williams poetry could be captured cinematically, immersing us in the rhythm and tone of his text.
  Positive
Strongs film is less interested in what Salinger did than in what led him to do what he did.
  Negative
It assumes the audience has already read Catcher in the Rye, and on that level, its a missed opportunity.
  Negative
As a character study, the picture is efficiently made and never less than watchable, but it lacks the urgency and inspiration of Strongs best work.
  Negative
His two great scripts for  Jay Roachs HBO films, s  Recount and s  Game Change, take place over much narrower time spans and delve into the minutia of well-documented events in political history.
  Negative
As revealing a profile as Slawenskis book may have been, it still left countless facets of Salingers life shrouded in mystery.
  Negative
Just as the majority of his writing has been kept from the public eye, most of the authors years were spent in the isolation of his New Hampshire cabin.
  Negative
So many details are missing from this narrative that it feels more like a series of biographical beats mixed with theories than a fully fleshed-out portrait.
  Negative
Nicholas Hoult is a gifted actor more than capable of illuminating the insecurities and fixations of his character, but he's never quite believable as Salinger.
  Positive
He resembles the youthful, chiseled vision that the author likely had of himself when he stubbornly insisted that only he should be allowed to play Caulfield.
  Negative
Yet Hoult can only do so much with a script that leaves his key motivations frustratingly muddled.
  Negative
His finest moment occurs toward the end, after bidding adieu to an old friend.
  Negative
As he watches the man walk away, Hoult opens his mouth as if to holler out to him, before abruptly turning and exiting the frame.
  Negative
That fleeting nuance suggests Salingers desire to have said more, and one wishes the film had said more too.
  Negative
The friend in this scene is Story magazine editor Whit Burnett, Salingers former writing teacher as well as the first person to publish the authors work.
  Negative
Hoults lingering glance at Burnett poignantly affirms that this man was as close to a father figure as any Salinger ever encountered, certainly much more so than his maddeningly aloof old man.
  Negative
If Rebel in the Rye has any advantage over Roachs equally flawed Oscar bait,  Trumbo, its the pitch-perfect casting of its ensemble headlined by  Kevin Spacey as Burnett.
  Positive
For the second time this year, the actor has injected a weirdly paternal warmth into an initially formidable authority figure.
  Positive
As the crime boss in  Edgar Wrights  Baby Driver, Spacey transformed gobs of exposition into a sardonic symphony, while guarding the young hero in ways both frightening and touching.
  Positive
I couldnt help being reminded of the teacher Spacey played in  Mimi Leders much-maligned yet often well-acted  tearjerker, Pay it Forward during Burnetts early scenes, as he simultaneously charms and challenges his students into transcending their own expectations.
  Positive
He believes that an authors voice is the extension of their ego, and that a story falls apart when that voice fails to incorporate a strong narrative.
  Negative
The irony of this script is in how its narrative fails to incorporate Salingers own voice, no matter how many quotes it borrows from him.
  Negative
How much more powerful would the post-WWII scenes have been had they explored the specific ways in which Salingers war service formed the themes of his novel, much like how  Laurent Bouzereaus riveting Netflix documentary,  Five Came Back, illustrated the impact of war on directors such as  Frank Capra and  William Wyler?
  Negative
Caulfields allergy to phoniness achieves new depths of meaning in light of Salingers disillusioning return to the states, where he was informed that his PTSD was just a phase.
  Negative
It also helps explain why Salinger balked at the notion of artistic compromise, even if it resulted in his work remaining unpublished.
  Negative
Better to leave his writing honest and in a drawer than sanitized and read by the masses.
  Positive
There are several individual scenes here that are effective on their own, but they are surrounded by far too many others in which Salinger meets with a revolving door of mentors.
  Negative
For an alleged rebel, he sure seems willing to obey the advice of Burnett, not to mention that of his spiritual guru, Swami Nihilananda  Bernard White, and his literary agent, Dorothy Olding  Sarah Paulson, making the most of her brief screen time.
  Negative
Burnett tells Salinger to turns Caulfields story into a novel, and he does.
  Positive
Nihilananda tells Salinger to remove the distraction of the city from his life, and he does.
  Negative
Olding approves of Salingers dream to write for himself rather than for his rabid fans, and the rest is history.
  Negative
Each of these motives are spelled out in all-too-tidy a fashion, while the more intriguing material is overlooked.
  Positive
We meet the high school student whose betrayal of the author is routinely blamed for his subsequent seclusion, but we never get to see what a Salinger-led youth group looks like.
  Negative
Also missing is a satisfactory reason for why he cruelly shut Burnett out of his life for so many years, other than pure pigheadedness.
  Negative
This is a glaring omission since Spacey and Hoults scenes together form the heart of the picture, especially when contrasted with any scene pairing Salinger with one of his lovers.
  Positive
After receiving a lackluster reception at Sundance, Strong recut the film for its theatrical release, and though I didnt view the previous cut, this one appears to be comprised of half-realized highlights from a television miniseries.
  Very negative
Consider the grand entrance of Oona ONeill, splendidly played by dead ringer  Zoey Deutch.
  Negative
Shes set up as the unattainable object of Salingers lust, but as soon as they share a single scene together, shes cast out of the picture before we get the chance to absorb the significance of their relationship.
  Negative
When Salinger arrives back home after the war, his German wife  Anna Bullard is as much a surprise to his family as she is to the audience whereas Deutch got one big scene, Bullard only gets one line.
  Negative
As Salingers second wife,  Lucy Boynton has a nice introductory scene where she delights Salinger with a frank put-down of his work, but it isnt long before the infatuation fades and she turns into just another face for him to ignore.
  Negative
At least she gets one good line in response to her husbands ill treatment of Burnett: With all that meditation, youd think you wouldve learned to forgive by now.
  Neutral
Alas, forgiveness isnt always easy, especially if youre  Joyce Maynard, one of the many young female admirers Salinger reportedly seduced for sexual favors before promptly abandoning them.
  Negative
Perhaps Rebel in the Rye glosses over Salingers treatment of women precisely because of these disturbing claims.
  Negative
After all, they certainly would render the films stated conviction that Salinger produced work without expecting anything in return resoundingly phony.
  Negative
