Theres nothing inherently wrong with the long-form, multi-song music video, man.
  Negative
Thats literally what I was thinking as God Help The Girl, the debut directorial debut from songwriter and musician  Stuart Murdoch, stretched past its hour-and-a-half mark.
  Negative
The movie doesnt quite make it to two hours, but my patience was tried pretty much any point at which the movie went a long stretch without a song.
  Negative
For God Help The Girl is indeed a musical, and a good thing, too.
  Positive
The movie has no deficit of talent in the performing department either.
  Negative
The wide-eyed, beguiling  Emily Browning plays Eve, a young, dreamy woman struggling with depression, who, upon release from a hospital after a suicide attempt, makes her way into Glasgow with a song in her heart and little else in the way of direction.
  Negative
She bops her way into the life of young musician James  Olly Alexander, so bookish and near-elfin that  Michael Cera could probably break him over his knee' a flirtation leads to a roommate situation' a visit to one of James music students, Cass  Hannah Murray leads to a three-way friendship' the friendship leads to a band.
  Positive
Eves self-defeating involvement with a snooty French rocker  Pierre Boulanger leads to a recurrence of emotional trouble.
  Negative
And so it goes.
  Positive
The story, such as it is, gets punctuation and emphasis via musical numbers, some of which seem to take place in the imaginations of the characters, some in the context of band practice or performance and so on.
  Positive
Said musical numbers are pretty tip-top.
  Positive
Murdoch, who also wrote the songs, is the brains behind the Scottish band Belle and Sebastian, whose canny mix of folk and continental pop stylings inspire the frequent use of the word twee among rock critics.
  Negative
I think thats an unfair call: Belle and Sebastians mix of smooth sonics and sardonic wit strikes me as pretty genuine' twee implies a level of affectation that the character of the music just doesnt support.
  Negative
In any event, Murdoch has said that God Help The Girl, which has its origins as a concept album of sorts, ended up a vehicle for a group of songs that he felt wouldnt fit into Belle and Sebastians repertoire.
  Negative
I see his point, a bit, but by the same token, I have no problem in saying that if you like Belle and Sebastians tunes, youll like the almost two dozen songs in God Help The Girl.
  Negative
Its also likely youll enjoy the way theyre visualized.
  Positive
Browning gets a lot of nifty retrochic costumes, and the strongest song scenes feel like the picture sleeves of French s from the s come to life.
  Positive
Also beguiling is the perspective on Glasgow' Murdoch shoots it as a largely sunny, sometimes bustling place that occasionally drifts into autumnal quiet.
  Negative
So whats the problem?
  Neutral
The problem is that Murdochs script, and his direction of the non-musical bits, is lackluster to the point of somnambulant.
  Very negative
Murdochs songs show him a writer of fair-to-excellent verbal wit, and his dialogue has more than a few zingers Ive got the constitution of an abandoned rabbit, good one but he simply isnt a dramatist.
  Negative
He can put together homages to A Hard Days Night and Rock And Roll High School in the space of one song, but he cant string together really engaging character material when the musics over.
  Positive
And his actors try really hard to make up for the deficit.
  Negative
I really dont believe in the idea of Critics Telling Artists What To Do, but my idea concerning a long-form music video is not, I believe, an altogether bad one.
  Very negative
That is, paradoxical as it might seem, God Help The Girl would have felt more like a real movie and been more fun, and moving had the story material been cut to the barest of bones, and that narrative, which is pretty slim to begin with, carried on the backs of the songs.
  Positive
Which, I cant emphasize enough, really are special.
  Positive
Soundtrack album drops in the U.S. this week, and I can recommend THAT without hesitation.
  Very negative
