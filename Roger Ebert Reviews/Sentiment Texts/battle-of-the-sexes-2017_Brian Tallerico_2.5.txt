Going into Battle of the Sexes, one might expect an equally-balanced look at the lives of self-proclaimed chauvinist Bobby Riggs and tennis superstar Billie Jean King.
  Negative
This is not that movie.
  Negative
And it shouldnt be really.
  Positive
The best angle of the film is the way it illuminates the difference between fighting for equality and battling to hold on to perceived superiority.
  Very positive
Of course, this is a fight that continues to this day, and not just in terms of gender.
  Negative
If anything, theres a better version of Battle of the Sexes that focuses even more fully on King, villainizing Riggs and his grotesque culture of sexism in a way this movie disappointingly seems scared to do.
  Negative
The material involving Kings fight for equality is powerful, and the performances are uniformly strong, but theres a TV movie approach to the emotion and truth of this situation that softens it in detrimental ways.
  Positive
Its not a bad film, but Billie Jean Kings story could have been so much deeper.
  Negative
Its a movie that doesnt hit nearly as hard as she did.
  Neutral
King is played by the Oscar-winning  Emma Stone, who captures her unique blend of determined grit and awkward social behavior.
  Positive
Her take on King is relatively shy and spotlight-averse, the opposite of the gregarious Bobby Riggs, portrayed by  Steve Carell.
  Negative
A gambling addict, the -year-old Riggs has lost his drive, looking for the next hustle to keep him happy, even as his bad habits frustrate his wife, played in a totally thankless role by  Elizabeth Shue.
  Negative
When the head of the Tennis Association, played with an almost caricature degree of smarm by  Bill Pullman, offers a tournament in which the female winner will get , while the male winner gets ,, King jumps ship, and she takes almost every female tennis player that matters with her.
  Positive
Led by Gladys Heldman  Sarah Silverman, the ladies form their own tennis tour, and the world notices, including Bobby Riggs.
  Negative
While Riggs is looking for his next big thing, King is confronted with something she didnt expect, a romance with her hairdresser, Marilyn Barnett  Andrea Riseborough.
  Negative
Happily married to Larry  Austin Stowell, Billie Jean never expected to fall in love with another woman, and its the kind of affair that could destroy her career, especially as the new tour is trying to find sponsors.
  Negative
With this new romance as the backdrop, King ends up agreeing to a one-time match with Riggs, who believes that an over-the-hill male tennis player can still beat the  young, female tennis champion.
  Negative
While a lot of the people around her see this as just a gimmick, she realizes the message it could send to the world if she loses.
  Negative
With copious amounts of s style and music, directors  Jonathan Dayton and  Valerie Faris  Little Miss Sunshine work hard to recreate a period in which male chauvinism could still be very easily taken as a public position.
  Negative
Its hard to imagine a dinosaur like Bobby Riggs getting any attention beyond a small core of morons nowadays.
  Negative
Even if his brand of sexism is depressingly alive and well, its not the kind of thing sports announcers openly defend.
  Negative
Listening to Howard Cosell and company legitimize Riggs worldview shows how much of a culture King had to work to tear down.
  Negative
However, it also makes one wonder why writer  Simon Beaufoy didnt take a tougher stance against Riggs.
  Neutral
Scenes with his wife and child are clearly designed to humanize him in a way that feels oddly disingenuous.
  Negative
At one point, hes a goofy charmer, but then we see how much larger a hill that King had to climb because of the Riggs brand of sexism and its hard not wish the movie didnt too often treat him as a harmless clown.
  Negative
Theres a better version of Battle of the Sexes that focuses more completely on just King because this half-developed, comedy approach to Riggs life doesnt add enough to this version.
  Negative
As for performances, Dayton amp' Faris have always been strong with an ensemble, and thats true here as well.
  Positive
Stone is subtle and powerful, but Riseborough actually gives my favorite performance of the film, playing someone who feels more three-dimensional than the icons at the center of the piece.
  Positive
Similarly,  Alan Cumming does a lot with just a few scenes, which isnt that unusual for him.
  Negative
Less fortunate are Shue and Pullman, turned into the archetypes of the Frustrated Wife and the Sexist Boss.
  Negative
The final scenes of Pullman sneering as he watches the match might as well have had him twirling a curled mustache.
  Negative
Its that superficial approach to the world around Billie Jean King that diminishes her story.
  Negative
Instead of a timeless story, this feels like a Hollywood production that softens what was truly and genuinely a battle, one that women are still fighting today.
  Positive
