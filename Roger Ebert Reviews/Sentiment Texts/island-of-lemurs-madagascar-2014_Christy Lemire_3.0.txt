Some are on the verge of extinction.
  Neutral
All are amazingly photogenic and awesome to behold in the -D IMAX documentary Island of Lemurs: Madagascar.
  Positive
This is not an animated spin-off about the wacky King Julien and his pals from the  Madagascar movies.
  Negative
At no point does  Sacha Baron Cohens character dash around flamboyantly and sing about how he likes to move it-move it.
  Negative
Although it would be a shock to no one if such a film were in development, along with the Minion spin-off from the  Despicable Me universe which is due out next year.
  Negative
While following a comfortable and familiar formula, Island of Lemurs: Madagascar accomplishes a great deal in its -minute running time, entertaining and educating us while delivering a message about preservation thats clear without being heavy-handed.
  Positive
Director and cinematographer  David Douglas, who previously shot the  IMAX -D documentary Born to Be Wild about orangutans and elephants, offers breathtaking aerial footage of vast, green forests and severe, majestic rock formations.
  Very positive
But you and your kids are here to see the plucky, furry creatures who inhabit these spectacular, remote places.
  Negative
And boy, do they deliver.
  Neutral
Theres something simultaneously charming and haunting about these lean and agile primates a playfulness to their demeanor but an intensity to their eyes.
  Positive
They stare directly at us, undaunted, but it feels as if they can look right through us.
  Negative
They also leave a powerful impression on the ears.
  Positive
One sequence in the film features several lemurs clinging to trees and calling out to each other in shrill, high-pitched tones.
  Negative
Individually, the sound is cacophonous, but a forest full of them making this noise plays like an anxious symphony.
  Positive
Along those lines,  Mark Mothersbaughs score is suitably lighthearted but sometimes a tad intrusive when natural sound might have been more effective.
  Negative
And the use of a cover of The Ronettes Be My Baby as a couple of lemurs meet for the first time with the hope that theyll eventually mate is cringe-inducingly on the nose.
  Negative
But these are minor quibbles in a movie that solidly fulfills its purpose.
  Positive
Morgan Freeman narrates the film of course, his voice rich with both amusement and gravitas.
  Positive
And what hes been given to read is mercifully free of cloying anthropomorphism.
  Negative
No cutesy names, backstories or emotions have been assigned to these creatures, as is so often the case in family-friendly nature documentaries.
  Negative
The lemurs actions more than speak for themselves, and their faces are so expressive that we cant help but connect with them.
  Positive

  Negative
Since then, hundreds of species have developed throughout Madagascar, many of which are now endangered.
  Negative
Douglas wisely recognizes that the images of these animals will capture our hearts, but just as inspiring is the work of American primatologist Dr. Patricia C. Wright.
  Positive
Shes dedicated her time and research to preserving these creatures at Ranomafana National Park but it gets harder and harder to find lemurs and protect them when so much of their rainforest home has been burned and cleared to make room for farming.
  Negative
Children in the audience may not be able to comprehend fully the magnitude of such a dire ecological shift, but the intimacy of the IMAX -D format will allow them to feel as if they can reach out and touch these strikingly beautiful animals, and smile, and laugh.
  Positive
And maybe the cute factor will lead to curiosity and hopefully, ultimately a greater understanding.
