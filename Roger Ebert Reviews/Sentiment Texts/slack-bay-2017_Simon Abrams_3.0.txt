"Slack Bay," a black comedy set in the picture-esqueFrench countryside during the summer of , is a mystery that isn't especially mysterious, and a comedy that isn't all that funny.
  Negative
This is a deliberate strategy rather than a failure of imagination.
  Negative
For starters, writerdirector  Bruno Dumont reveals to viewers within the first  minutes!
  Positive
the fate and the culprits behind a series ofdisappearances that plaguethe film's title location.
  Neutral
Dumont "Hadewijch," "The Life of Jesus" also sucks the air out of a number of broad slapstick gags, using long takes and medium-range photography that reminds viewers that what they're watching isn't supposed to be funny in a laugh-out-loud way.Dumont's characters' motives are consequentlyhard to divine, despite convincingly twitchy performances from French actors  Fabrice Luchini and  Juliette Binoche.
  Very negative
So while I do recommend"Slack Bay," I must warn you: this is a misanthropic comedy that features cannibalism, weird religious overtones, and a lot of goony pratfalls.
  Very negative
The film's charms are substantial, but what makes "Slack Bay" so original and enticing is also what makes it fairly alienating.
  Positive
Dumont, who is more interested in characters than plot, follows three groups, each defined by their limitations.
  Negative
First, there's the Van Peteghem family, a group ofslow-witted, inbred artistocrats who vacation in Slack Bay every summer.
  Negative
The Van Peteghems love the countryside and are quick to gush over its natural beauty.
  Positive
They're also quick to flail their arms, and goggle their eyeswhenever something unexpected or improper seems to happen ex: they're constantly silencing their outspoken maid Nadege.
  Negative
Next, there's bumbling police Inspectors Machin Didier Despres and Malfoy  Cyril Rigaux, two clueless police officers who tellingly wear the same matching suitandbowlerhat combination as Laurel and Hardy or maybe Thompson and Thompson, from Herg's famous Tintin comic books.
  Negative
Malfoy is just as blinkered as the Van Peteghems, but he's not nearly as clumsy as Machin, an obese buffoon who frequently trips or falls over because he's oblivious of his own surroundings.
  Negative
Finally, there's the Bruforts, a family of poor mussel-gatherers who keep to themselves, and are quickly again:  minutes!
  Negative
revealed to be thuggish cannibals more on this shortly, promise.
  Positive
Any description of "Slack Bay" must make it sound exhaustingly nihilistic.
  Negative
After all, the Bruforts and Van Peteghems are both defined by broad stereotypes: the rich Van Peteghems are oblivious and shrill while the poor Bruforts are withdrawn and un-introspective.
  Very negative
This divide is best illustrated by the differences between the Brufort and Van Peteghem children.
  Positive
The Bruforts have four boys who, save for atypically -year-old Ma Loute  Brandon Lavieville,are quick to start fights and play pranks on everyone while the Van Peteghem girls, led by bold Billie Raph, are flirtatious but remote.
  Negative
But Ma Loute and Billie defy their respective families'clannishness by developing a romantic bondin the shadow of the Inspectors' ongoing and completely ineffectual investigation.
  Negative
It's an unusually tender relationship defined by innocent flirting and adolescent awkwardness, thoughboth characters exemplify and are victims of their families' close-mindedness.
  Negative
The Van Peteghems see the world through the lens of progress: goofy patriarch Andre Luchini marvels at the growth of nearby wisteria, buthis wife Isabelle Valeria Bruni Tedeschi poo-poos him, saying that "That's the nature of things: they grow."
  Negative
Andre is also quick to dismiss Machin when he explains that his wife is also his cousin once-removed: man, woman, family, outsiders it's all the same tothe privileged.
  Negative
MaLoute is alsoa product of his insular, incurious family.
  Negative
When asked what his name means, he shrugs.
  Neutral
And when Billie remarks with awe about the beauty of the surrounding country-side, he shrugs, and tells her that it's nothing special.
  Negative
Still, according to the logic of "Slack Bay," both characters are right.
  Neutral
This marriage of gorgeous landscape photography, and psychologically simple protagonists is a Dumont specialty.
  Positive
Ma Loute technically the film's title character since theoriginal French title is "Ma Loute" and Billie are compellingbecause they're outcasts.
  Negative
They try to break free of their normal programming in order tobe something other than what they already are.
  Negative
But Dumont also lavishes so much attention on the inhuman Van Peteghems and Bruforts because he finds their ugliness fascinating, too.
  Positive
They're fundamentally obvious characters who think they're more complex than they are.
  Neutral
They're as dumb and klutzy and ugly as they seem, but their inability to see that is what makes them more than just hateful caricatures.
  Negative
Dumont's longer-than-average takes make viewers feel time passing: these aren't just objects of pity, or condescension, but rather a pessimist's idea of humanity's struggle to transcend their moreabject qualities.
  Negative
"Slack Bay" is, in that sense, a deceptively spiritual film.
  Positive
It just happens to be about incestuous snobs, and man-eating hicks.
  Negative
