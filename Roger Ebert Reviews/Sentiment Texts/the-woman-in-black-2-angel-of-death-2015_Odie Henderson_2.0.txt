Heres a film that would have benefited from being shot in black and white.
  Neutral
For about rds of its runtime, The Woman in Black  evokes memories of the films of producer Val Lewton.
  Negative
Theres a deliberately slower pace and the unsettling feeling that the titular creature physically haunts every frame.
  Negative
The camera ominously prowls over that which it surveys, and on more than one occasion, we question whether weve seen something or the mere hint of something--in the background.
  Negative
Ominous noises are a fixture on the soundtrack.
  Negative
Any horror depicted is a manifestation of the heros psychological issues, brought forth by the stressful situation in which she has found herself.
  Neutral
In color, this is hit or miss.
  Negative
But bathed in silvery cinematography, with a heavy accent on shadow and darkness, The Woman in Black  might have served as an effective tribute to movies like Curse of the Cat People.
  Negative
That is, if it hadnt completely squandered all this goodwill in its last third.
  Negative
As if anticipating the audiences dissatisfaction with mere atmospheric creepiness, director  Tom Harper and screenwriter  Jon Croker backload the jump scares and the silliness, cramming way too many simply for effect moments in the last half hour.
  Negative
The two biggest jolts are in the commercial, though judging by the audience reaction at my screening, not many people have seen those TV ads.
  Negative
This is an odd sequel in that its titular character has been reduced to a supporting role.
  Negative
The Woman in Black  focuses on Eve  Phoebe Fox, a teacher whose young students are evacuated from London during the Blitz.
  Neutral
One of her students, Edward  Oaklee Pendergast has just lost both of his parents to a bombing.
  Negative
Rendered mute from the shock, Edward communicates with pencil and paper when hes not staring catatonically into space.
  Negative
This provokes cruelty from the other students and a sense of maternal protectiveness in Eve.
  Neutral
Eve and her charges are relocated to Eel Marsh House, the haunted site of the original Woman in Black.
  Negative
En route, she meets Harry  Jeremy Irvine, a charming pilot stationed at a base not too far from Eel Marsh House.
  Positive
Sparks are evident, especially when he pays her a visit once shes settled in at the house.
  Positive
When a vengeful spirits name is in the title, however, theres little running time for hanky-panky, rumpy-pumpy or wistful gazes across crowded rooms.
  Negative
Fans of the original film know that  Daniel RadcliffesArthur Kipps went to town of Crythin Gifford where Eel Marsh House was located.
  Negative
He tells the story of how the unmarried Woman in Black gave birth to a son she was forced to give up to her sister.
  Negative
The son, Nathaniel, was killed by the unusual topography surrounding the road that leads to Eel Marsh House: At high tide, the road is submerged in water, causing Nathaniel to drown while the Woman in Black looked on helplessly.
  Negative
After she died, the Woman in Black returned to haunt Eel Marsh House.
  Negative
Her appearance is a harbinger for the death of a child.
  Negative
In the sequel, the doomed child in question is Edward.
  Negative
The Woman in Black  is more disappointing than much of the recent crop of PG- horror fare because it introduces several ideas that are worth exploring.
  Negative
It brings up issues such as maternal guilt, societal pressure on women and the trauma of losing either ones child or ones parents.
  Negative
It ties these elements directly to the supernatural aspects of its plot, and it heightens the tension.
  Positive
As such, the film cannot be easily dismissed as an exercise in sequel-based laziness.
  Negative
Unfortunately, the silly climax and a less than satisfying ending mar all that came before it.
  Negative
I must point out for sensitive viewers that there is a fair amount of children in peril scenarios here, some of which are potentially or actually fatal.
  Neutral
The Woman in Black aims to kill Edward as a form of revenge against Eve, for reasons Ill leave you to discover.
  Negative
To achieve her goal, our ghostly apparition isnt above causing the brutal demise of some of Eves charges.
  Negative
While not particularly violent, these scenes do have the potential to upset some audience members, so be warned.
  Negative
As for the actors: Fox does a capable job, even when her dialogue is reduced to yelling Edward!
  Negative
or calling out hello?
  Neutral
as she enters the kinds of dark spaces reserved solely for women in horror movies.
  Neutral
She gets a good monologue about the tie she has with her vengeful enemy.
  Positive
Irvine isnt given much to do besides appear dashing, so his last reel heroics feel a bit off.
  Negative
Pendergast looks like hes in shock, which makes sense, but the movie keeps his character at such an emotional distance its easy to lose focus on the purpose of Eves actions.
  Negative
While it gets points for effort, The Woman in Black  is ultimately unsuccessful.
  Negative
Its occasionally creepy but never scary despite the last reel histrionics.
  Neutral
This is where the black and white cinematography might have helped.
  Negative
It would have accentuated the mood and made the bumpier spots less noticeable.
  Negative
I plan to rent the DVD and watch it again with the color levels down on my TV to see if I were right.
  Negative
