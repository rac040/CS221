In  Stardust Memories,  Woody Allen described his mothers cooking as putting food through the deflavorizing machine.
  Negative
The Hunters Prayer is like a  Luc Besson film put through a deflavorizing machine to remove any element that could be distinctive, energetic, or fun.
  Negative
The most over-used, over-wrought, over-determined and downright pretentious aspects of movies about a hit man with a heart are all here, dumbed down.
  Negative
Scene in a dance club with pulsing electronic music?
  Negative
Yes.
  Neutral
Our heroes infiltrate a fancy party in a mansion surrounded by lots of wealthy people all dressed up?
  Negative
Yup.
  Neutral
Ultra-violent shoot-outs that fail to attract the attention of a single cop?
  Negative
You bet.
  Neutral
Even though the characters have been on the news and there are many chases and lots of gunplay, the police show up just once, only to allow a hit man to stroll casually out of the building as they race in.
  Negative
Is there a loners hideout with unfinished walls, uneaten food, a flat screen TV, and a small shrine revealing the assassins tender side?
  Negative
Sure is.
  Neutral
Does someone looking into a gun barrel say, Please, you dont have to do this!
  Negative
or someone pointing a gun say Its not personal' its business?
  Neutral
Check and check.
  Neutral
As those examples suggest, the actors palpably struggle to deliver numbingly wooden dialogue.
  Neutral
The posh British criminal masterminds threats are interchangeable with those of the American gun for hire.
  Negative
No one wants the teenager on the run to sound like a hashtag, but some element of background and personality should come through in what she says.
  Negative
That teenager is Ella  Odeya Rush of " Goosebumps".
  Negative
Sneaking a smoke at her posh Swiss boarding school, she tells her friends she is going to go dancing with her boyfriend.
  Positive
She does not know that a shadowy gunman has just killed her father and stepmother and burned down their Scarsdale mansion.
  Negative
Ella gets the news from Lucas  Sam Worthington, who grabs her from the club.
  Negative
I was hired to kill you but Im not going to do it because I cant, he tells her in a typically clunky over-explanation.
  Negative
The hit has been put on Ella to send a message to anyone else who might possibly consider stealing from super-criminal Richard Addison  Allen Leech of Downton Abbey.
  Negative
Ellas late father has betrayed Addison, who therefore put a hit on the entire family.
  Negative
Like everyone else in the film, Addison is a paper-thin caricature.
  Negative
He is so evil that he breeds attack dogs and tests them out on hapless minions.
  Negative
He even snaps at his young son, What have I told you about your mother?
  Negative
My mothers a whore, the boy sadly replies.
  Negative
And, of course, he orders a hit on a teenager.
  Negative
But Lucas is a dad himself, and even paid assassins who think they are dead inside can be reminded of their honor and humanity, especially when they are in a dumb movie that needs some reason for its protagonists to chase and be chased, shoot and be shot at.
  Negative
Those chases and shoot-outs are generic as well: some squeal-wheel turns down the streets of various European locations, some rows of squibs playing the part of automatic weapons fire.Even those sparks of energyonly have value as contrast to the uninspired stunts and story.
