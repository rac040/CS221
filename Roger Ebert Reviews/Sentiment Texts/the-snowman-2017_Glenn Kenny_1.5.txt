In the year , if man is still alive, if woman can survive, and they start writing histories of stcentury cinema, The Snowman will make a very excellent case study.
  Positive
Perhaps by that time sufficient evidence will have been gathered to explain just why a movie assembled by a group of mostly first-rate talents wound up such a soggy, slushy mess.
  Negative
I myself cannot quite figure it out.
  Negative
Adapted from the bestselling mystery novel by J Nesbo, the movie stars  Michael Fassbender as a Norwegian police detective with the much-already-remarked-upon name Harry Hole.
  Negative
Why they couldnt have just called him Harry Chasm or Harry Abyss is beyond me.
  Negative
The movie begins with what turns out to be a flashback.
  Neutral
The scene is shot with what appears to be a lilac petal dangling in front of the lens.
  Negative
In a large cabin in a snow-covered field, a man in a police car visits a young boy and his mother.
  Negative
And there the man administers a test to the boy, slapping the mother every time the kid gets a question wrong.
  Negative
Things go from bad to worse, and eventually a Volvo sinks into a lake, and a kid is left homeless.
  Very negative
Cut to the present day, and Harry is sleeping off a drunk in a bus shelter.
  Negative
Heckuva way for a cop to conduct himself, but Harrys a special cop.
  Neutral
A little later on in the picture, Katrine Bratt, who becomes Harrys unofficial partner on a serial killer case, tells him that she studied his cases in the academy.
  Negative
Harrys a genius detective whose personal life is an utter mess.
  Negative
One of the movies many problems is that the viewer is treated to much more of the mess part than the genius part.
  Negative
In point of fact, I dont think the genius part ever emerges.
  Negative
I mentioned first-rate talents.
  Positive
The cast is what they used to call one of International All-Stars.
  Neutral
Aside from Fassbender, theres the engaging  Rebecca Ferguson as Bratt.
  Positive
Charlotte Gainsbourg is here as Harrys ex-girlfriend.
  Neutral
Toby Jones is a policeman in another Norway town.
  Negative
Val Kilmer, his voice rather badly and inexplicably dubbed, turns up.
  Negative
As does J.K. Simmons, speaking in his own voice and applying to it a credible and yet somehow incredible mid-Atlantic accent.
  Positive
You havent lived until youve heard him say gah-raaaahzzh, but Im not sure Id pay sixteen bucks for the privilege.
  Negative
There are big names who should know better behind the camera as well.
  Negative
The director is  Tomas Alfredson, who made the very excellent   Let the Right One In and the very ambitious and mostly excellent   Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.
  Very positive
The three screenwriters,  Peter Straughan,  Hossein Amini, and  Sren Sveistrup, have not unusually disgraced themselves in the courses of their respective careers.
  Negative
The editor is  Thelma Schoonmaker, the veteran of much work with  Martin Scorsese, who is here an executive producer.
  Positive
On the subject of editing, lets move back to that opening scene.
  Positive
Given to where it cuts to, the viewer might infer that the movies orphan grows up to be its hero.
  Negative
Which provides a frisson, or is meant to provide a frisson, to the fact that the movies serial killer seems to know an awful lot about Harry, and that the killer constructs snowmen at the scenes of his crimes, snowmen that look an awful lot like one that appears in the opening scene.
  Negative
How, one might wonder, did the killer get sufficient insight into Harry and his past to be able to taunt him like this?
  Negative
Well, not to give anything away, but the film is constructed to misdirect the viewer as much as possible.
  Negative
I think theres a relatively simple reason for this, and it also has to do with why this ostensibly adult thriller has an ending thats almost literally a gloss from a  Scooby-Doo episode: the actual plot, once laid out in a way that makes sense, is so patently packed with convenient coincidences that its practically simple-minded.
  Very negative
Another problem is this: snowmen arent scary, and when you try too hard to make them scary, you just make it worse.
  Very negative
The movie is strewn with camera pans from innocent-looking street scenes to  THREATENING SNOWMAN FACE, and the effect is very Dramatic Chipmunk, only less dynamic.
  Very negative
To top off all of the ineffective weirdness, the movie ends on a tone-deaf got a sequel if you want it note.
  Negative
I do believe, and Im sorry for this, that itll be a cold day in hell before any such thing materializes.
  Negative
