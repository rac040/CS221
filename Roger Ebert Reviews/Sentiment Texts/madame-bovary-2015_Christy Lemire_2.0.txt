For a classic literary character whose motivations are so plain and so primal, Emma Bovary has been a tough nut to crack on screen.
  Positive
Several esteemed directors have given it a shot over the years, including Vicente Minnelli in  and  Claude Chabrol in .
  Positive
Finally, a woman  Sophie Barthes has directed and co-written a film version of  Madame Bovary, but strangely, that doesnt result in any more richness or enlightenment.
  Negative
Whereas the tone of  Gustave Flauberts great novel which created such a scandal when it was published in  was all-knowing and almost mocking of his characters, their follies and their foolish decisions, Barthes takes a tack of emotional detachment.
  Negative
Mia Wasikowska is more than willing to make this flawed, doomed heroine enormously unlikable, but her choices seem impetuous and childish rather than a deeply felt backlash against stifling boredom within a loveless marriage at a time when women had zero agency over their own lives.
  Very negative
Perhaps the intention was to contemporize this figure, though' with her distractingly flat American accent, Emma Bovary could be Betty Draper, or a reality-show housewife, or the mom waiting in front of you in an SUV in the pickup line at school.
  Negative
Barthes and co-writer  Felipe Marino have significantly streamlined and mixed up the narrative, beginning with Emmas tragic ending and working their way back to it.
  Negative
Theyve jettisoned the beginning of the book focusing on husband Charles childhood, they do away entirely with the couples daughter, Berthe, and they combine two male characters to create Emmas first, tumultuous lover.
  Negative
Major emotional shifts come abruptly, while other sections are languid, brooding and often wordless to reflect Emmas isolation.
  Negative
This Madame Bovary begins as teenage Emma is packing up her belongings and preparing to leave the convent to marry the man her farmer father has arranged as her husband: country doctor Charles Bovary  Henry Lloyd-Hughes.
  Negative

  Negative
Emma longs for more excitement, passion, status, love.
  Positive
She shows restraint at first when smitten law clerk Leon Dupuis a boyishly romantic  Ezra Miller skittishly professes his affections for her.
  Neutral
But shes definitely ready for extramarital activities once the dashing Marquis  Logan Marshall-Green makes even more overt advances.
  Negative
The affair emboldens her and gives her glimpse of the good life, inspiring her to spend more and more money she doesnt have on lavish dresses and decorations from the obsequious dry-goods dealer Monsieur Lheureux  Rhys Ifans, whos all-too happy to continue extending her credit.
  Positive
Marshall-Green and Ifans both do their best to enliven the proceedings, the former with sheer sex appeal and the latter with sly menace.
  Positive
Similarly,  Paul Giamatti who starred in Barthes last feature, the kooky and clever sci-fi comedy  Cold Souls nails the pushy patter of local pharmacist Monsieur Homais.
  Negative
But as we know either from reading the book in high school or merely from watching the first few moments of Barthes film Emmas longing for upward mobility becomes her downfall.
  Negative
Theres little tension as her romantic and financial calamities collide, only mere traces of tragedy.
  Negative
Even at nearly two hours, much-needed character development is sorely lacking.
  Negative
Madame Bovary is never less than lovely to look at.
  Negative
Cinematographer  Andrij Parekhs melancholy images seamlessly combine muck and luxury, sometimes within the same image, in a way thats reminiscent of  Joe Wrights  Pride and Prejudice and  Thomas Vinterbergs  Far From the Madding Crowd earlier this year.
  Negative
And the clothes are gorgeous the work of costume designers  Christian Gasc and Valerie Ranchoux as Emmas tastes become more expensive and extravagant.
  Positive
Fastidiously tailored and flouncy, her ornate gowns in a wide array of jewel tones vividly reflect her transformation from pious convent girl to brazen adulteress.
  Negative
But the lavish aesthetic trappings, combined with the emotional emptiness, only combine to make Barthes film feel like Madame Bovary: The Fashion Show.
