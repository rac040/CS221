One of the more foolhardy stunts ever pulled by a major Hollywood studio in recent years was forcing Aardman, a conclave of exceedingly clever Brits who are considered by many as the supreme purveyors of the clay-manipulating process of stop-motion, to release a pale computerized imitation of one of its trademark efforts in .
  Negative
Its title?
  Neutral
Flushed Away.
  Positive
You remember it, right?
  Neutral
No?
  Neutral
Its better if you dont.
  Neutral
Hugh Jackman voiced a posh pet rat who discovers a underground city teaming with rodents in the London sewer system.
  Negative
Apparently, the amount of water scenes required was deemed too tricky to be successfully captured by Aardmans meticulously hand-crafted artistry.
  Negative
That same artistry, however, was behind the sleeper success of s  Chicken Run and s Oscar-winning Wallace amp' Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, where the tactile feel of the human touch can be subtly sensed as the figures onscreen are painstakingly brought to life.
  Negative
Needless to say, the compromised Flushed Away pretty much lived up to its name at the box office.
  Negative
It took another, better computer-animated film, s Arthur Christmas, before Aardman learned its lesson and returned to doing what it does best, making exceedingly amusing films with pliable characters.
  Negative
As much as movie theaters these days are overrun with toon blockbusters that are bold, bright and brassy blasts of hyper-charged entertainment that barely take a breath, stop-motion is a different animal, one that feels innately multi-dimensional even without -D because it is created with physical objects.
  Negative
And Aardman, who gave the world such dryly witty wonders as the  short Creature Comforts as well as the long-running man-and-his-dog comedy duo of Wallace amp' Gromit, takes a stealthier, more-assured approach that is found in wild-and-woolly abundance in its latest triumph, Shaun the Sheep Movie.
  Positive
Based on a long-running TV series consisting of shorts that take place on a quaintly cozy patch of northern English countryside known as Mossy Bottom Farm, this brisk -minute serving of visually piquant capers owes as much to Warner Bros.
  Negative
Sam the Sheepdog and Ralph the Wolf as it does to  Buster Keaton, Rube Goldberg,  Babe: Pig in the City and those Serta mattress ads whose sheep are designed by Aardman, by the way.
  Negative
With zero actual dialogue, Shaun the Sheep Movie is a silent film except that the soundtrack is overrun with noises mumbled gibberish, growls and bleats and gags involving audio effects and thematically-on-the-nose music.
  Negative
But most of the communication comes in the form of the expressive faces of its cast.
  Positive
Shaun is the rascally leader of a flock of eight, including baby Timmy and chubby ewe Shirley, owned by a ginger-haired middle-ager who is bald, bespectacled and none too astute.
  Negative
Simply known as the Farmer, he remains blissfully oblivious to his sheeps penchant for human-seeming behavior such as walking on two legs and engaging in elaborate schemes hatched by Shaun.
  Negative
Bitzer, the put-upon bulbous-nosed sheepdog who is outfitted like a track coach, regularly attempts yet only partially succeeds to keep Shaun and his cohorts in line.
  Negative
Other regulars who make an appearance include the Naughty Pigs and an opportunistic duck.
  Negative
As the movie begins, a certain malaise has settled upon the farms residents, who are clearly weary of their everyday rural routine.
  Negative
Leave it to Shaun to come up with a way for the sheep to take a break.
  Negative
Unfortunately, their prankish efforts cause the Farmer to fall asleep in a caravan that accidentally becomes unmoored and ends up rolling into The Big City, which we can assume is London.
  Very negative
The sudden disappearance of their master leaves Shaun and the sheep bereft not the least because they cant feed themselves.
  Negative
Plus, as a sweetly nostalgic prologue reveals, the Farmer is really the only father figure that they have ever known.
  Negative
Shaun sneaks onto a double-decker bus to hunt him down and the rest of the sheep follow as sheep are wont to do.
  Negative
Also on the scent of the trail is a distraught Bitzer, who locates the Farmer in a hospital where he has been diagnosed with memory loss.
  Negative
Eventually, he ends up aimlessly wandering through the urban landscape until he stumbles into momentary fame.
  Negative
There is a villain in the form of an over-eager animal containment officer who is bedeviled by the wads of snowy fleece he keeps finding on the street.
  Positive
But most of the plot builds upon humorous set pieces that escalate usually with chaotic results inside of a charity shop, a fancy restaurant, a pricey hair salon and an animal compound that looks like a jail.
  Negative
The plot is simple enough for a preschooler to follow as are many of the jokes.
  Negative
How delightful is it that the sheep take full advantage of their ability to put humans asleep by circling around a barrier that they leap over one by one.
  Positive
To paraphrase The  Patty Duke Shows TV theme, any bone is bound to make Bitzer lose control.
  Negative
Yes, the Aardman-ites provide a full contingent of butt sight gags as well as bodily function hilarity, but they never feel desperate or excessive.
  Negative
And adult cineastes will be able to giggle knowingly at references to  Cape Fear,  The Night of the Hunter and most appropriately  The Silence of the Lambs.
  Positive
Banksy-like graffiti graphics, multiple acts of fist bumping and, in the case of lobsters, claw bumping and a dig at social media thats about as au currant as such references get.
  Negative
As a pushover for this distinctly Ol Blighty brand of comedy, the chuckles came early and often for me.
  Negative
There is something in the way that the sheeps mouths unhinge and slip sideways whenever they emit an utterance or simply smile that I find charmingly ingenious in its physiological impossibility.
  Negative
While the shorts have an undercurrent of antagonism, there is actually a warm and fuzzy feeling of loyalty and affection shared between Shaun, the sheep, their canine frenemy and the Farmer.
  Positive
They are, whether they always like it or not, a family.
  Negative
A message supporting pet adoption even sneaks into the proceedings thanks to a mangy street mutt who assists the sheep.
  Positive
But laughter is the main goal here.
  Positive
Pixar might have uncovered the mysteries of our brains with  Inside Out.
  Negative
But Aardman knows its way around our funny bones.
  Positive
Just keep Bitzer away from them.
  Positive
