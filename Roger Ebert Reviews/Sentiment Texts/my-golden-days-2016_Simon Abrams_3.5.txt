The title of French coming-of-age drama "My Golden Days" originally named "Trois souvenirs de ma jeunesse," or "Three Memories of My Youth" simultaneously is and isn't a sincere assessment of Paul Ddalus' memories of adolescence.
  Negative
As an adult, Paul  Mathieu Amalric recalls his past in fragments or so he says.
  Negative
Since Paul's memories are presented as three self-sufficient, narratively unrelated segments,"My Golden Days" primarily concerns Paul's teenage romance with Esther  Lou Roy-Lecollinet.
  Negative
In fact, Esther and Paul's relationship monopolizes the film: the other two "memories" that Paul recalls are relatively slight anecdotes, stories thatprovide a compelling, but inessential backstory for Paul played by  Quentin Dolmaire when Paul is  years old.
  Positive
This is the first hint that the film's American name cannot be strictly trusted.
  Neutral
As our unreliable window into his past, Amalric's Paul abruptly switches his voiceover narration from the first to the third person.
  Negative
He also warns us and in the past as well as the story's present day tells everyone that he remembers nothing but these three"fragments" with absolute clarity.
  Positive
Paul's stories are arguablygoodhappymemories, but they are also full of melancholy, and anxiety.
  Neutral
Still, he's chosen toturnthem into miniature oases of time that he can return to at a moment's notice because of relatedunderlying traumas that writerdirector ArnaudDesplechin " A Christmas Tale," "Esther Kahn" thankfully does not fetishize or sappen up with tacky sentimentality.
  Negative
Paul's stories are the ripples created by Paul's actions.
  Neutral
He is never not in controlto blame for his life, a tough-minded mentality that inspires rich, personal dialogue and characterizations.
  Positive
Like Bernardo Bertolucci's enthralling " The Dreamers" before it, "My Golden Days" humanely treats adolescence as a revolutionary period that is at least partly motivated, though not entirely explained by, teenagers' disdain for parents, teachers, and other authority figures.
  Positive
Thefirst of Paul's three memories actively hints atwhathe's trying to escape: beatings from hisfather Abel  Olivier Rabourdin and manic episodes withmother Jeanne Ccile Garcia-Fogel.
  Negative
But again, this is Paul's story: nothing that Paul does in "My Golden Days" can be neatly or exclusively attributed to a previous encounter.
  Negative
When he meets Esther, he doesn't treat her as a surrogate mother, nor does he change in his attitude towards a slightly older, and relatively benign Abel.
  Negative
Instead, he tosses off considerate self-assessments like "The truth is I don't see Abel because I can't help him," and moves on to the next party, the next book, or just the next scene.
  Negative
That "and moves on" bit is crucial.
  Neutral
Paul's competing passions frequently make it impossible for him to comfortably support a relationship with Esther, a popular, sexually active -year-old that Paul tries to impress by acting uninterested.
  Negative
Their will-theywon't-they romantic tension arguably provides "My Golden Days" with its main narrative, but that's not really what the film is about.
  Negative
Desplechin revels in milieu, and in the clarity of his characters' expressions.
  Positive
These protagonists' motives are transparent.
  Negative
They have no reservations about their actions: Paul and Esther frequently develop relationships outside of their own, and insist that theirsatellite hook-ups are purely sexual.
  Negative
But you can seecracks in their cool facades when they joke and tease each other, like when Paul brushes off a girlby flatly insisting "You're drunk.
  Negative
You deserve better."
  Neutral
Her flirtatious, matter-of-fact rejoinder is priceless: "You're wrong.
  Negative
I'm not drunk."
  Neutral
That kind of evasiveness is essentially why Desplechin's drama feels so honest.
  Positive
Paul repeatedly insists "I'm fine.
  Positive
I didn't feel a thing" because his first impulse is to run away, to put up a front,andtokeep thoseinter-personal defenses up when he hears Esther beg him to stay with her "I get scared when you're gone".
  Negative
He's touched by her letters, but that's just it: these messages are honest, but they're also composed, as Desplechin notes by filming Roy-Lecollinetreading her letters to his cameraPaul in head-on, fourth-wall-probing close-ups.
  Neutral
Neither Esther nor Paul completelybare their souls in melodramatic breakdowns, though they do cry a couple of times.
  Negative
Desplechin wants viewers to see them as people that protect themselves, and in so doing reveal more than they probably know.
  Negative
These memories do not constitute a world of experience, but rather one world among many.
  Negative
If Desplechin chose to make a sequel to "My Golden Days," it could easily just be three, or five more isolated vignettes.
  Negative
Desplechindeserves special praise for severing turning Esther into a disposable foil for Paul's rich inner life.
  Negative
Roy-Lecollinet does the heavy lifting throughout, butDesplechin dotes on her character, like in the scene where Esther dances self-consciously but earnestly at a hash party while The Specials' "I Can't Stand It" plays, and Paul watches her move.
  Negative
When you watch Roy-Lecollinet struggle to lose herself in the music, you see her as an active character, one who could never be dismissed as a projection, or as an enigma that Paul must solve.
  Negative
You get the impression that these events are all happeningoutside of Paul's head, a remarkable feat given that we're periodically reminded that we're watching life through Paul's eyes.
  Positive
"My Golden Days" exists simultaneously within and outsideof its characters' headspace, a testament to Deplechin's powers of imaginativesensitivity.
  Positive
