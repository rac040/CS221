A popular topic that has been bobbing about the internet these days: Will the summer of Hollywoods sequel and prequel box-office discontent bounce back with the arrival of Finding Dory, Pixar and Disneys double-dip back flip into the same animated pool of undersea beings that propelled s wondrously endearing  Finding Nemo?
  Negative
Therefore, it is a relief to note that the follow-up has plenty of emotional hooks, some great lines and is no stinker, despite simply following what amounts to the same plot current as before except to the Pacific Coast of California instead of the Great Barrier Reef of Australia.
  Negative
If Finding Nemo felt like a blissful day at the beach, then Finding Dory is an eventful afternoon at an aquatic park or, in this case, the Marine Life Institute that, as the omniscient recorded voice of  Sigourney Weaver re-assures any PC-oriented visitors to the facility, is dedicated not to human amusement but to Rescue, Rehabilitation and Release.
  Negative
The result might be less fulfilling this time, but Finding Dory is ultimately worth the voyage.
  Positive
Wisely, the film takes full advantage of what was Finding Nemos greatest asset besides its lushly multi-hued underwater inhabitants and plant life: Ellen DeGeneres buoyant spirit and child-like glee as she vocally gave life to Dory, the forgetful yet fearless blue tang whose struggles with short-term memory loss proved to be a crucial plus whenever the going got tough as stressed-out daddy clownfish Marlin searched for headstrong young son Nemo.
  Negative
After all, nothing is more freeing than barely being able to summon your past, which is why the impulsive Dory is so good at acting in the moment.
  Negative
It can be a dicey proposition to upgrade a comic-relief supporting player into a headliner.
  Neutral
But much like  Robin Williams, who so memorably riffed up a blue streak as the Genie in  Aladdin, DeGeneres and her sometimes goofy, sometimes giddy persona continues to be a perfect fit for the role that provided the uplifting salt-water soul of Finding Nemo and pretty much does the same here as Marlin a returning  Albert Brooks and Nemo replacement  Hayden Rolence swim alongside her on a new journey a year after the first.
  Negative
The story is not as fresh of a catch as the original, even if the script is again by  Andrew Stanton along with co-writer  Victoria Strouse, who once more directs with an assist from  Angus MacLane.
  Negative
Ultimately, there is too much reliance on logic-defying Saturday -morning TV cartoon action as the main characters swim about by scooting through pipes and flopping from one liquid vessel to another at the institute.
  Very negative
It was somewhat believable when the gang of fish led by  Willem Dafoes world-weary Gill staged a great escape from the tank at the dentists office in Finding Nemo.
  Neutral
But the sequel stretches beyond credibility when newcomer octopus Hank a testy tangle of tentacles with chameleonic powers voiced by Modern Familys Ed ONeill is somehow able to maneuver a runaway truck on a crowded highway when he cant reach the pedals or see over the dashboard.
  Negative
What your brain might not accept, however, your heart just might.
  Negative
Finding Nemo was propelled by its perceptive depiction of a single parents overwhelming need to protect a child, especially one with an undersized fin, instead of letting him fend for himself and gain a sense of independence.
  Negative
Here, Stanton calls upon the same sort of primal instinct when we initially meet Dory as an innocent, big-eyed, kiddy-voiced guppy whose concerned parents Charlie and Jenny portrayed by  Eugene Levy and  Diane Keaton explain how she must always tell whoever she meets, I have short-term memory loss.
  Negative
Or, as she sweetly calls it, short-term remember-y loss.
  Neutral
Instead of her daffy-go-lucky grown-up self, Dory is a helpless tyke whose recall vaporizes almost instantly because of her learning disability and she inevitably wanders off into the undertow, leaving her despairing mom and dad behind to devastating effect.
  Negative
The movie fully kicks in when the older Dory experiences an electric jolt of a flashback and, with that brief flicker, realizes she actually has parents.
  Positive
And off she goes, with ever-grumpy Marlin and supportive Nemo following soon after, to locate her family.
  Negative
She might be looking for her parents, but Dory is really unearthing her own identity and manages to stir up other defining memories along the way, no matter how fleetingly.
  Positive
That includes the sources of her inspirational motto, Just keep swimming, and how she came to speak whale.
  Positive
Some old favorites from Finding Nemo float by including that cool turtle dude Crush and son Squirt, fish-school instructor Mr. Ray and those Mine!
  Positive
Mine!
  Neutral
Mine!

-chanting seagulls.

But few of the new characters, which include a brain-addled beluga whale  Ty Burrell of Modern Family and a near-sighted whale shark  Kaitlin Olson, make a lasting impression besides a pair of lazy Cockney sea lions  Idris Elba and  Dominic West, together again after being on opposite sides of the law on The Wire rehabbing at the institute who only stir whenever their silent crazy-eyed cohort Gerald who appears related to Ed the hyena from  The Lion King dares lay a flipper on their rock.
  Negative
Except for Marlin, who learns a valuable lesson in empathy after hurling a hurtful observation at Dory when she inadvertently puts Nemo in harms way, almost every creature encountered from a bird-brained loon to an immense chatty clam that recalls Audrey II in  Little Shop of Horrors gladly helps out our heroine with her mission.
  Negative
You can guess whether its accomplished or not, but lets just say there is a have-a-hanky-on-hand happy ending.
  Positive
Actually, there are two or three happy endings since the filmmakers dont know when enough is enough.
  Positive
That includes a coda that requires wading through a waterfall of end credits that nonetheless is worth the wait.
  Negative
