On the occasion of the arrival of a lumbering load of steampunk-drenched, whimsy-drained wrongheadedness disguised as family entertainment known as Pan someone is really baiting headline writers with that pun-ready title let us ponder this conundrum: Why do filmmakers continue to feel the need to squeeze all the joy and magic out of such a remarkably enduring figure of Edwardian-era make-believe as J.M. Barries Peter Pan?
  Negative
The whole I wont grow up ethos of this aerodynamically gifted lad resonates today as proven by NBCs live presentation of the stage musical version last year.
  Positive
But many current movies and TV series are already rotten with lost boys who act their shoe size instead of their age.
  Negative
Who needs another  Peter Pan movie when you have the man-child-riddled oeuvres of  Judd Apatow,  Joe Swanberg and the Duplass brothers?
  Neutral
Then again, not even  Steven Spielberg could resist squeezing  Robin Williams into the role of an adult Peter in the midst of a mid-life crisis in s  Hook.
  Neutral
P.J. Hogan laced his big-budget visit to Neverland in s Peter Pan with a dark undercurrent of Freudian sexuality, including a bombshell Tinker Bell.
  Negative
And, in , Marc Forster's  Finding Neverland turned its sentimental spotlight on Barrie himself and his unconventional and somewhat questionable relationship with a sickly widow and her gaggle of sons.
  Negative
But none of those efforts are quite as difficult to sit through as Pan.
  Negative
Every once in a while, a movie comes along that is so punishing to ones mental and physical being that the narrative should be divided into rounds instead of acts.
  Negative
Add in dizzying -D effects and a booming sound system, and the pummeling can be rope-a-dope exhausting.
  Negative
Granted, British director  Joe Wright has shown a knack for enlivening literary classics such as Pride amp' Prejudice and Anna Karenina with stylish camera techniques and visual verve.
  Positive
But while he can do action and romance, as proven by " Atonement," he has never shown an affinity for full-out fantasy despite the once-upon-a-time elements in the girl-assassin thriller  Hanna.
  Negative
And, with "Pan," he still hasnt.
  Positive
To begin with, the very premise feels off.
  Negative
Peter Pan isnt a superhero and doesnt really need an origin story, especially one that opens at a London orphanage for boys during the Blitz and borrows heavily from the  Oliver Twist handbook.
  Negative
Peter the chubby-cheeked foundling becomes Peter the spunky -year-old in quick measure, and he is played by one of the films few assets,  Levi Miller.
  Neutral
The Australian native, a one-time Ralph Lauren model, exhibits a flair for comic delivery and handles the derring-do rather well.
  Positive
But he cant save a sinking ship or should that be a stinking ship?
  Neutral
all by his lonesome.
  Neutral
It seems that the nuns who run this orphanage are selling off their charges to pirates even the sisters in  Philomena didnt stoop that low who drop down from the ceiling on bungee cords and pluck them from their beds before stowing them aboard an airborne galleon to Neverland.
  Negative
That is where Peter meets his main nemesis, Blackbeard, the leader of this scurvy band of buccaneers.
  Negative
Never has  Hugh Jackman looked so wretched, not even when he first got out of jail in Les Misrables, than he does decked out like a seedy conquistador with ghastly makeup, bad wig and gnarly teeth that suggests Don Quixote as a meth addict.
  Very negative
Turns out, he sort of is.
  Negative
Remember how  Dennis Hopper inhales that mysterious gas in  Blue Velvet?
  Negative
Jackman dons a weird mask and huffs a rejuvenating substance, mined on the island with the use of the child labor supplied by the orphanage, known as Pixum the street name for crystalized pixie dust.
  Negative
Wright is usually pretty savvy about casting.
  Positive
After all, he put  Carey Mulligan and  Rosamund Pike in Pride amp' Prejudice and basically discovered  Saoirse Ronan when he gave her a major role in Atonement.
  Negative
But he makes a couple fatal errors here.
  Negative
Garrett Hedlund might be easy on the eyes but he is awful on the ears with a grating cowboy drawl as James Hook, who is presumably the future Capt. Hook.
  Negative
This dreadful amalgamation of Sawyer from Lost, Indiana Jones and  Slim Pickens from Dr. Strangelove forms an alliance with Peter after they hijack a pirate ship and take off for the woods.
  Very negative
That is where they find big casting mistake No.
  Negative
:  Rooney Mara as hatchet-wielding Tiger Lily, who is traditionally supposed to be a Native American princess.
  Negative
Remember all the fuss about a Caucasian like  Emma Stone trying to pass as a half-Hawaiian, half-Chinese character in  Aloha?
  Negative
Well, this is Aloha redux.
  Negative
There is an attempt to portray Tiger Lilys tribe as a rebel collective of various races and nationalities.
  Negative
But why not hire a Native American anyway, especially considering how utterly bland Mara is in the part?
  Negative
From the music the soundtrack employs the anachronistic tunes Smells Like Teen Spirit and Blitzkrieg Bop for absolutely no reason, unless pirates are into grunge and punk to the CGI tricks to justify the -D, we get to follow the trajectory of a falling bomb, watch a floating chicken lay an egg and enjoy a fight conducted on a trampoline, Pan is a pandemic of poor choices.
  Very negative
And no one is going to clap their hands to save it.
  Negative
