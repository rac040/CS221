Money doesn't make you mean and being poor doesn't make you nice.
  Negative
Jerks cross class lines.
  Positive
Jerks are born, not made.
  Negative
At least that's partially the premise of writerdirector  Onur Tukels semi-satirical "Catfight," starring  Sandra Oh as Veronica, a wretchedly unpleasant trophy wife, and  Anne Heche as Ashley, a struggling angry artist who is equally awful.
  Negative
The two women hated one another on sight when they met in college, and that hatred blossoms into something even more toxic when they run into one another by chance at a catered affair.
  Negative
It's so toxic that the two women have a brawl in a stairwell that leaves Veronica in a coma for two years.
  Negative
When she wakes up, her whole world has changed.
  Neutral
And that's just the beginning.
  Neutral
This sounds like the plot of a melodrama to end all melodramas, or a "woman's picture" seen through a pitch-black lens, but the overall tone is deadpan.
  Negative
The women's fury erupts out of that deadpan, making both of them look absurd, like clowns having fake-fights for a howling audience of idiots.
  Negative
This is all played for laughs and for the most part, the laughs do come.
  Positive
These two talented actresses push the envelope in unlikability to the limit and there's something very cathartic about that.
  Negative
There's a scene where Ashley rips her assistant to shreds for using a blue shipping label, and Heche plays it real, ratcheting up her attack into such emotional violence that it's terrifying.
  Very negative
To make matters weirder, "Catfight" takes place in a fictional time eerily close to our own where a new president has declared "war on the Middle East" and that war will require all hands on deck.
  Negative
Nobody seems to question it.
  Neutral
Or even pay attention.
  Neutral
On the television screens in every room, a late-night TV host cracks jokes about the dire state of the world before calling onto the stage the "Fart Machine," a guy who farts on command while the studio audience howls with laughter.
  Negative
It's clear now just how prophetic Mike Judge's  film "Idiocracy" really was.
  Negative
Both women live in a nightmare of domesticity.
  Negative
Veronica's husband Stanley Damian Young is a war profiteer, and a mean-spirited version of the husband role Young played in Lisa Kudrow's HBO series "The Comeback."
  Negative
Ashley lives with Lisa  Alicia Silverstone in a state of constantly simmering tension.
  Negative
Lisa is the breadwinner, does not like Ashley's ugly paintings, and wants to start a family.
  Negative
Lisa seems semi-normal at first, although there's a later scene at a baby shower that Silverstone plays brilliantly, one of the most openly funny scenes in "Catfight," where Silverstone reveals just how passive-aggressive and snotty her character is.
  Negative
Lisa smiles at Ashley in a way that lookssupportive, but on a closer glance you can see the irritation and contempt.
  Negative
It's a very funny performance.
  Very positive
The women have three fights in the film, and each one is a major affair, messier versions of the knock-down drag-outs that fill " John Wick" end to end.
  Negative
They take place in, respectively, a stairwell, a vacant lot and a forest glade.
  Positive
Attention must be paid to Balint Pinczehelyi, who did the superb fight choreography.
  Negative
The fights are operatic, raucous and extremely violent.
  Negative
They go on so long they practically rival the epic fight scene in "The Quiet Man."
  Positive
Stunt doubles were used, but Oh and Heche are clearly doing a lot of their own stunts, and they are so ferocious it's obvious these characters actually meanto kill one another.
  Negative
It's common to say that we live in a very literal age, an age where satire is dead, where people credulously share Onion articles on Facebook and then dig their heels in when it's pointed out to them the article is not real: "Well, it COULD be real."
  Negative
Yes.
  Neutral
That's satire.
  Neutral
But every age has its sacred cows, and satire chips away at those cows, at the privileged, at society's unquestioned structures and assumptions.
  Positive
"Catfight" is not at that level satire is the most difficult genre to do well, and the film's tone is a hard one to sustain.
  Negative
The fights anchor the narrative, as do the various mirroring effects, with dialogue repeating and situations on an eternal loop.
  Negative
The world Tukel creates is one that is falling apart quickly.
  Negative
The country's atmosphere is that of Total War.
  Neutral
The self-involved populace adjusts to it automatically.
  Negative
"Catfight" shows that civilization is an extremely fragile veneer over a pit of seething venom.
  Negative
It doesn't take much for that veneer to crack.
  Negative
And instead of pouring all their rage onto the powers-that-be who really deserve it the people sending kids off to war, the television host parading a Fart Machine as entertainment, the audience who finds the Fart Machine funny, the entire unfair ugly world these women turn it on one another.
  Negative
"Catfight" is not the story of two gals who hate each other and then realize, over appletinis, how much they have in common.
  Negative
Tukel takes that tired clich and blows it to smithereens.
  Negative
Let's hear it for unvarnished hatred expressed with no holds barred.
  Negative
