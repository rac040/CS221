A simple approach to art can be a virtue when chaos reigns in the world.
  Positive
Just like the neo-folk music that serves as its soundtrack while providing an emotional salve for its characters, Song One initially serves as a lilting if sometimes downbeat respite from the cacophony that often passes as cinema today.
  Negative
But even a stripped-down emo-ode to the healing power of music needs to build up to a satisfying crescendo.
  Positive
In her feature debut, writerdirector  Kate Barker-Froyland tends to tiptoe away from the dramatic high notes that audiences often crave and comes up a stanza or two short from a fulfilling resolution.
  Negative
Often, Song One feels like the timid B-side of last summers more satisfying music-biz saga, the much less woe-is-me and a lot more lets-have-some-fun  Begin Again.
  Negative
Unlike many low-budget indie titles, however, the novice filmmaker does have the benefit of a couple of actual stars in her cast.
  Negative
They go far to help carry this story about how a young woman reconnects with her family in New York after a car accident leaves her estranged brother Boardwalk Empires  Ben Rosenfield, a Brooklyn-based busker, in a coma.
  Negative
As Franny, a rather sullen globe-trotting anthropologist working on her doctorate,  Anne Hathaway looking like the early  Liza Minnelli with her gamine hairdo isnt quite as distraught as she was while winning her  supporting Oscar as miserable prostitute Fantine in Les Miserables or as a weepy astronaut in last years  Interstellar.
  Negative
Still, her big-screen crying jag continues apace as she and her mother  Mary Steenburgen, who does what she can as a self-absorbed intellectual whose props include American Spirit cigarettes and a twee accordion take turns sitting vigil in the hospital while hoping for a miracle.
  Negative
Remember when Hathaway charmed us as a quick-witted gangly Everygirl in  The Princess Diaries and  The Devil Wears Prada that could make us laugh?
  Negative
Where has she gone?
  Neutral
Back to the plot.
  Neutral
Lacking a sanctuary while back home her mother has symbolically given her bed away to her mail person Franny stays in Henrys room and, like the anthropologist she is, steeps herself in what he has been up to while pursuing his music dreams.
  Negative
Besides recordings, there is a journal stuffed with scribblings: lyrics, deep thoughts, photos and, lo and behold, a ticket to an upcoming concert by his favorite balladeer, James Forester.
  Positive
If you get an inkling that Franny and hipster-poet James will get involved romantically after she tells him about Henrys situation and his admiration for him, that would be a bingo.
  Negative
Johnny Flynn, the English actor-musician who plays James, duly possesses the soulful eyes and shy presence of a folk artist.
  Positive
And he certainly sings and performs well enough, both on guitar and violin.
  Positive
It is not hard to believe that countless giggly girls in their summer frocks would line up after the show to see him.
  Negative
He is also kind enough to stop by to see Henry the next day.
  Positive
Alas, his character is soon revealed to have all the personality of a very sincere though slightly damp sponge.
  Positive
It also is a little too convenient that he has been dumped by his girlfriend, which has blocked his talent for composing new material.
  Negative
Guess who will be his next muse?
  Neutral
Bingo again.
  Positive
What time Franny doesnt spend with James in clubs is devoted to appealing to Henrys senses with familiar sounds and smells in the hopes it will stir him.
  Positive
She records street noises for him to hear.
  Neutral
She buys takeout pancakes from his favorite all-night diner and pours syrup on them in front of his nose.
  Negative
Franny even shells out money for an antique gramophone to replace one that Henry broke and spins some scratchy records on it in his hospital room.
  Negative
Will her efforts pay off?
  Neutral
Will we be able to tolerate her and James somewhat ill-advised relationship long enough to find out?
  Neutral
One wonders what Hathaway saw in this only partially-baked story.
  Neutral
It turns out Barker-Froyland was an assistant to Prada director  David Frankel, and it is nice to know that the actress is supporting her climb up the Hollywood ladder.
  Positive
But for those hoping that Ms. Les Miz will sing again for her supper, given the subject matter of Song One, you will have to settle for Hathaways intentionally amateurish crooning of Americas soporific s chestnut I Need You.
  Negative
At least she knew better than to revive A Horse With No Name.
  Neutral
