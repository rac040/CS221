It still hasnt quite completely registered that our remaining  Philip Seymour Hoffman performances are finite.
  Negative
And just as listening to "Nevermind" changed after Kurt Cobains passing or " The Dark Knight" took on new resonance after losing  Heath Ledger, every performance already seen and the few remaining to be released feels more poignant.
  Negative
Even in a disappointing film like  John Slatterys "Gods Pocket," Hoffman makes unique, personal, realistic choices that other actors wouldnt have considered.
  Neutral
An already somber drama like this adaptation of a  Pete Dexter novel feels even more melancholy knowing its one of the last characters that well ever get from Hoffman.
  Negative
Sadly, it wont be one hes remembered for as the star of "Mad Men" misfires with a tonally inconsistent, deadly dull slice of working class life that may have a great cast but remains forgettable in every way its star so often refused to be.
  Negative
Slatterys directorial debut opens with a bit of overwritten columnist prose from writer Richard Shellburn  Richard Jenkins about the "simple men" who live in Gods Pocket, a blue-collar community of hard drinkers, gambling addicts, tough workers, and the women who love them.
  Negative
"Whatever they are is what they are."
  Neutral
One of many problems with the script of "Gods Pocket" by Slattery and  Alex Metcalf is that it presents an alcoholic, hack writer in Shellburn but feels like it let the character write the dialogue.
  Negative
This is one of those odd pieces of work in which characters will say things like "Nothing works against you like time.
  Negative
Times a bitch."
  Neutral
Or "Its getting cold."
  Neutral
"Yeah, its a cold world."
  Neutral
I dont need to tell you that no one speaks like this in the real world and its the kind of overwritten dialogue that may work fine on the page in Dexters novel but feels false on the big screen, especially in a project that needed either stark realism or the kind of black comedy approach that the Coens bring to their films not the gray area in between.
  Negative
And a flat, beige color palette shot with dull, lifeless cinematography from the often-great  Lance Acord doesn't help.
  Very negative
Hoffman plays Mickey Scarpato, another outsider like Shellburn who just doesnt get the people of Gods Pocket, maaaaan.
  Negative
But hes deep in the community, married to Jeanie  Christina Hendricks and friends with a local named Bird  John Turturro.
  Positive
Jeanies son Leon  Caleb Landry Jones is a typical young tough guy who works on a construction site and mouths off to the wrong guy, who cracks him in the back of the head, killing him.
  Negative
The construction workers cover up the manslaughter, disguising it as an accident but Jeanie suspects something is off about her sons death.
  Negative
While shes encouraging people like Shellburn to get to the bottom of the mystery, Mickey is trying to scrape together the funds to pay for Leons funeral to the slimy Smilin Jack Moran  Eddie Marsan.
  Negative
Bird owes Mickey money but he owes more dangerous guys like Sal  Domenick Lombardozzi too.
  Negative
Betting on horses, drinking the night away across the street from your house, dealing with gossip its just life in Gods Pocket.
  Negative
And life in Gods Pocket is dull.
  Negative
As hard as it may be to believe with a cast of actors who almost always bring something interesting to their work and the quality Slattery has delivered not only in front of but behind the camera on his AMC hit, this is a flat, boring affair.
  Negative
Halfway through, the narrative takes a twisted turn and one realizes that Slattery never figured out the tone.
  Negative
Is this supposed to be black comedy?
  Neutral
Are we supposed to identify with Mickey?
  Negative
Pity him?
  Neutral
Hope he escapes?
  Neutral
And what about Shellburn, the writer who thinks he knows all about Gods Pocket but really doesnt at all?
  Neutral
When he meets and falls for Jeanie, its entirely unclear how were supposed to respond.
  Negative
If one takes this as a "slice of gritty life" story, the dialogue isnt genuine and the plotting isnt interesting enough to carry it.
  Positive
Only a few character beats save "Gods Pocket" from total disaster.
  Negative
The friendship with Turturro has some lived-in energy early in the film.
  Positive
Marsan has always played slimy with ease.
  Positive
Hendricks proves she deserves a better role.
  Positive
And then theres Hoffman, again finding ways through the clich to occasionally tap into something genuine, whether its just in a world-weary shrug or a paunch that hints at a life lived hard and with more than its fair share of sadness.
  Negative
