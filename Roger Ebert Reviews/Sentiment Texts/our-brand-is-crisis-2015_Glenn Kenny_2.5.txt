It might be possible to make a good movie out of a cross between  Mike Nichols  Primary Colors and  Costa-Gavras  Z, but Our Brand Is Crisis, directed by  David Gordon Green in a seeming attempt to do something along those lines, is not that movie.
  Negative
Written by  Peter Straughan, and according to its credits inspired by the  documentary film of the same name, Our Brand is Crisis uneasily mixes the star vehicle with the screwball-political-comedysatire with the half-heartedly, in the end impassioned call to social consciousness arms.
  Negative
Though not without its entertaining moments the cast, led by  Sandra Bullock, is energetic, sharp and gets a fair number of juicy bits to rock out with.
  Positive
But as a whole, "Our Brand is Crisis" is a messy affair that sputters along when it should be humming with assured cynical momentum.
  Negative
It begins poorly, with an odd montage intercut to stagey interview footage in which Bullocks character, Calamity Jane Bodine, formulates an apologia for we-dont-quite-know-what.
  Very negative
Her words are intercut with footage of newspaper headlines and, oddly, shots of Bullocks hands molding clay at a pottery wheel.
  Negative
Underneath it all plays Ten Years Afters Id Love To Change The World, the absolute nadir of Woodstock-era protest rock' the movies sound editor deserves some kind of award for smoothly deleting the songs opening volley against dykes and fairies.
  Negative
The pottery business is explained forthwith, lest were worried about some  Ghost influence.
  Negative
After a traumatizing career as a political campaign consultant, Bodine has retired to the snowy mountains, where she doesnt smoke and makes bowls.
  Negative
Old colleague Nell  Ann Dowd brings young idealistic Ben  Anthony Mackie up to the woods to coax Jane down to Bolivia, to manage the presidential campaign of a conservative senator whose prior stint as head of that country was pretty  authoritarian.
  Negative
The news that Jane will be pitted against political consultant Pat Candy, with whom she has a past, is enough to get her away from the wheel.
  Negative
But once in Bolivia, shes sidelined by acute altitude sickness the flight down is accompanied by a primer on the geography and general stressed disposition of the place, and hence unable to immediately show her Sun-Tzu-informed genius to uptight candidate Castillo Joaquim de Almeida.
  Negative
At least not right away.
  Positive
Initially under the impression that her man is a dud, Jane is soon animated by Castillos spontaneous response to getting egged that is, he decks the egger and her personal animus against Candy.
  Negative
Candys played by  Billy Bob Thornton, and his serpentine southern charm and minimalist tonsorial stylings suggest real-life political maven  James Carville and it is perhaps no accident that Thornton played a deep-fried political strategist in Primary Colors, too  who was in the aforementioned documentary.
  Negative
But theres no real fun in determining the extent to which this movie is some sort of a clef expos.
  Negative
The real meat of the comedy, and drama, comes in the ingenious dirty tricks that Candy and Bodine play on each other, which could kick off a primer on the political practice recently known as rat-fking although that phrase is never uttered in the film.
  Negative
When Bullocks passionately advocating goes negative, or Thorntons smirkingly plays Mephistopheles to her from across their hotel balcony theyre close enough to speak to each other directly, but insist on staying on their cell phones the movie builds up an infectious energy.
  Neutral
But it never keeps the energy up, steering into forced visual gags, dull spells of earnestness, and ponderous backstory psychology the viewer never is quite sure who really did what to whom in the Candy-Bodine love-hate relationship.
  Negative
The insistent, intrusive music score by  David Wingo doesnt help matters, and neither do the too-many subsequent montages, all of which are of the always mistaken We Need A Montage variety.
  Very negative
Whats ultimately most frustrating is the evidence that the makers of this movie were fully capable of creating something as smart and ruthless as its lead character.
  Neutral
They just decided to be ingratiating and sentimental.
