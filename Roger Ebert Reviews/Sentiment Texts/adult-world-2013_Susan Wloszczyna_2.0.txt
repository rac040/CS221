There are probably poetry majors who do just fine once they must face the everyday realities outside of their campus cocoon that is, when they aren't busy dodging bill collectors coming after them for overdue student loan payments.
  Negative
I am just guessing here, but unless you are a rapper, jingle writer or  Maya Angelou, versifying isn't going to pay the rent.
  Negative
That is the ticklish pickle that "Adult World"'s Amy  Emma Roberts, whose grating cutesy-klutziness makes her come off more like a neurotic middle-schooler than a recent college grad finds herself in, once she steps forth from Syracuse University and finds that few potential employers are impressed by her ambitions as a bard.
  Negative
Her understanding parents want to support her artistic pursuits, but not when it comes to providing free room and board as well as funding the postage cost for all her rejected literary mag and writing contest submissions.
  Neutral
There is another conundrum to overcome in this coming-of-age comedy: Saddled with unjustified confidence and a total lack of actual life experience, this over-coddled wordsmith is better at self-delusion than she is at self-expression.
  Very negative
So Amy does what a desperate girl must do when stuck in a chilly, perpetually overcast city in upstate New York with few prospects and a Sylvia Plath poster on her wall: Take a job working in a sex shop hawking naughty DVDs, glossy skin publications and sundry erotic playthings.
  Negative
But not before she spazzes out and knocks down a dildo display in a fit of hysteria when she realizes exactly where the "Help Wanted" sign outside has led her.
  Negative
There is nothing to worry about, though.
  Negative
Adult World, as the store is both literally and metaphorically known, is less a den of iniquity than a source of colorful characters whose back stories would probably make for a more satisfying movie than Amy's.
  Positive
Your mood may brighten when it is revealed that the proprietress of Adult World is  Cloris Leachman, but it is destined to deflate when it becomes obvious that director  Scott Coffey Ellie Parker and writer  Andy Cochran have forgotten to give her anything interesting to do.
  Negative
Evan Peters Roberts' "American Horror Story" co-star and real-life fianc adds some dark-horse depth to Alex, a fellow clerk who clearly would like to get to know Amy better for some reason.
  Negative
Then we get a throwback to the  midnight  cult movies of yore with cross-dressing customer Rubia  Armando Riesco, managing to sidestep the more treacherous clichs even in high heels, who deigns to take Amy under her wing while providing temporary shelter.
  Neutral
At this point, you might say to yourself: Hey, I saw " Boogie Nights".
  Negative
Why is Adult World even in business considering you can download porn and order sex toys on the Internet?
  Negative
It falls into Alex's lap to come up with an excuse, something about the old-school pleasures of perusing shelves and immediate gratification.
  Negative
Right.
  Neutral
Probably the same reason that there is a small bookstore thriving nearby, where Amy learns that her absolutely favorite all-time poet Rat Billings is doing a signing.
  Negative
And thank goodness she does, because that allows  John Cusack to enter the picture as a onetime enfant terrible of couplets who peaked at  and has grown into a bitter, sardonic scribe coasting on his early glory.
  Negative
What does Amy do when she encounters her hero for the first time?
  Neutral
She knocks down those in line at the signing and later shrieks at her would-be mentor, "I just want to smash your head open and take everything in there."
  Negative
Billings tries to run but he cannot hide since he lives and works in the area.
  Negative
He and Amy form a tentative relationship she cleaning up his home and he muttering subtle insults under his breath while attempting to give this unfocused creature a clue about how to cultivate her seemingly meager talents.
  Negative
Or as he derisively notes, "You would be the type of muse I would get."
  Neutral
Cusack's distinctive handling of his sullen poet offers an opportunity for "Adult World" to make a statement about youthful ambition and middle-age disillusionment beyond Billings dubbing Amy and her peers as "Generation Mundane."
  Positive
But the film just stops short of truly achieving that goal.
  Negative
Too bad, because for a few moments I saw glimmers akin to another, much better version of a young woman's stalker-ish attachment to an older man.
  Negative
Namely, 's wonderful " Ghost World", which itself borrowed heavily from the equally essential "The World of Henry Orient" from .
  Positive
"Adult World", however, never quite fully delivers much more than yet another oh-poor-me take on post-collegiate struggles in the cold, cruel st Century.
  Negative
And that is a small world, indeed.
  Positive
