Fifteen-year-old David Portnoy  Kodi Smit-McPhee, in a beautifully natural performance is still grieving the loss of his mother when his dad James LeGros decides to re-marry.
  Negative
Even worse, Dad is going to marry the nurse  Daniela Lavender who took care of his mom in her final months.
  Negative
David, a shy and emotional kid, has thrown himself into amateur bird-watching, following in the steps of his passionate dead mother, who we learn, later, was "one of the unsung heroes of birding".
  Very negative
The under-seen  film " The Big Year" was another story about the wonders of birding, its competitive nature, its obsessive cataloging of detail.
  Negative
"A Birder's Guide to Everything" uses birding as the launching point for a tender and gentle coming-of-age story, as well as a meditation on grief and letting go.
  Positive
It is also that very rare thing, a movie about teenagers where the characters actually seem like real teenagers, as opposed to mini posing adults.
  Neutral
There's an innocence here, a real sweetness.
  Positive
Director  Rob Meyer the script was co-written by Meyer and  Luke Matheny finds the right tone early, sweet and almost sad, and, except for a few minor bumps along the way, doesn't falter with that tone.
  Positive
The coming-of-age clichs are certainly present here, but handled so sensitively that you don't mind it.
  Positive
The film cares about these characters.
  Negative
David is part of a birding club at school, which consists of only three members: David, Peter Michael Chen, who runs the meetings officiously, saying things like, "The Chair recognizes the Speaker", and Timmy  Alex Wolff, who seems to operate under the mistaken impression that ornithology will make him a total chick magnet.
  Negative
Unfortunately, the only girl in the group quit, having grown tired of Timmy's "tufted tit-mouse" jokes.
  Very negative
But all of the boys are serious birders.
  Negative
They are ambitious and they know their stuff.
  Positive
"A Birder's Guide to Everything" doesn't forget that teenagers are not just obsessed with sex and peer-popularity at school, although those "types" may dominate popular cinema.
  Negative
Nerds and geeks are usually the sidekicks in coming-of-age films, but here they take center stage.
  Neutral
They are not handled patronizingly.
  Negative
Nobody is mocked for being smart, for having their nose in a book, for wanting to acquire knowledge.
  Very positive
One day, riding home from school, David catches sight of a strange-looking duck waddling across the road.
  Negative
He takes a blurred picture, and enlists the opinion of a famous local ornithologist, Lawrence Konrad  Ben Kingsley, who takes one look at the photo and thinks that David may very well have captured on film a duck thought to be extinct.
  Positive
Lawrence Konrad has devoted his life to birding, even lost a leg in the pursuit.
  Negative
He has written a memoir called "Look To the Skies", which young David has read five times.
  Positive
Konrad suggests to the excited boys that the bird's migration pattern means it may be in such-and-such a place the following weekend, if they wanted to try to track it.
  Negative
Naturally, that is also the weekend of David's dad's re-marriage.
  Positive
Things are tense at home.
  Positive
James LeGros plays the father as a well-meaning guy who has clearly been derailed by his wife's death in ways he cannot begin to understand.
  Negative
And his son's trauma is incomprehensible to him.
  Negative
Dad says at one point, "Everything happens for a reason," and then hastens to take the insensitive comment back when he sees his son's devastated face.
  Negative
David and his friends decide to borrow the car of Timmy's cousin, even though none of them have their licenses yet, and take a road trip to find the bird.
  Negative
They need a better camera, though, and so Ellen " The Bling Ring"'s  Katie Chang comes along for the ride, brandishing her telephoto lens.
  Negative
She's not a birder but she's got the best gear.
  Positive
She's new in town, her father being in the Air Force.
  Positive
A girl in their midst throws everyone off, in a way that feels sweet and right, as opposed to lascivious and leering.
  Very positive
She is interested in learning about birding, and David points things out to her as they tramp through the woods, her face agog as she stares up into the trees.
  Positive
A birder's course is never smooth, and there are other competitive birders who get wind that the awkward teens may be on to a big discovery.
  Negative
Lawrence Konrad himself may not be above a little treachery.
  Negative
Kingsley plays the role with a twinkling gusto: he is an intellectual and tough-minded man, who also represents a father figure to David: Konrad knew David's mother well, he respected her achievements.
  Positive
David feels like his mother is being erased by his Dad's re-marriage and the callous giving away of her possessions.
  Neutral
He doesn't want his mother to be erased.
  Negative
He wonders if he will ever recover.
  Positive
Moments of humor are sprinkled throughout, and while some of the jokes miss the mark a whole bit about drugs in the car falls flat, the film flows on in its gentle way to the next moment.
  Negative
Nothing is derailed.
  Negative
The boys, in trying to hide their plans from the other birders encroaching on their quest, speak in stilted high school Spanish, the subtitles informing us that Peter is saying, "I will deceive them with agreement."
  Negative
As the kids lie in their sleeping bags around the campfire, one of them says, lazily, "Ever wish the earth was more like Middle Earth?"
  Negative
There is a pause, and one of the other other kids replies, "All the time."
  Positive
In a scene around the campfire, the four kids admit, one by one, that none of them has ever kissed anyone.
  Negative
Well, Ellen kissed one boy at a party once, but that's it.
  Neutral
Meyer handles this scene delicately, soft-pedaling the sentimentality, and creating a small intimate breathing space where another type of teen can exist on the screen.
  Negative
It's refreshing.
  Positive
At one point, David describes to Ellen the different kinds of birders, broken down by Konrad in his memoir: There are "feeders" and "listers" and, the highest level, "watchers".
  Negative
Watchers are the ones who actually learn how to see, whose obsession drives them into transcendent layers of sight, where the delineation between the bird and the watcher becomes irrelevant.
  Negative
It is a place of one-ness with your passion, with nature.
  Positive
Konrad admitted in his memoir that he was a "lister" who "strives to be a watcher".
  Neutral
David's memories of his mother are already fading.
  Negative
He thinks he will never get over the loss.
  Negative
His dad doesn't get it.
  Negative
His friends are kind, but they don't get it either.
  Neutral
David is a also "lister" striving to be "watcher".
  Neutral
Watching will include not only the birds through his binoculars, but his father, his lost mother, his new stepmom, his friends, himself.
  Negative
