There's a kitchen fight in "Central Intelligence" pitting a man with a butcher knife against a man with a banana.
  Negative
The man with the banana wins.
  Positive
I love scenes like this, where the movie seems to be saying, "This is the kind of movie I am the kind where you can kill a man with a banana.
  Negative
Enjoy."
  Neutral
And you do.
  Positive
The film is a buddy action comedy in the vein of " The In-Laws" and " Midnight Run," with a splash of s movie slapstick.
  Positive
Kevin Hart plays Calvin Joyner, a deadpan worrywart who was voted "Most Likely to Succeed" in high school.
  Negative
He has a good job and a charming wife but still feels like a failure.
  Negative
Dwayne Johnson plays his old high school classmate, Robert Weirdicht, aka Bob Stone, a bullied fat kid who grew up to become a muscular CIA agent but still wears a fanny pack and can't stop talking about " Sixteen Candles."
  Negative
Bob is six-foot-four and built like an action figure, which comes in handy in scenes that require him to do battle with a nunchacku-wielding assassin on a motorbike, or pirouette through a battle zone tossing tiny explosives from his fanny pack like Bugs Bunny as Brnnhilde strewing flower petals in her wake.
  Negative
Bob says he just wants to hang out with Calvin, the only guy in high school who was ever nice to him, on the eve of their th high school reunion.
  Negative
He's secretly a renegade agent accused of killing his partner and committing treason, and he needs Calvin's accounting expertise to thwart a terrorist plot and clear his name.
  Negative
But his adoration of Calvin is sincere.
  Positive
He loves Calvin the way little kids love superheroes.
  Positive
Worships him.
  Neutral
Adores him.
  Neutral
He tells Calvin he needs his help and asks if he's out or in.
  Positive
Calvin says he's not in.
  Neutral
Bob says he's in, that he was always in.
  Neutral
Calvin wants to know why Bob asked him if he was in or out if he was always in regardless.
  Neutral
Bob says it's because he wanted to feel the pride and excitement of hearing Calvin tell him he's in.
  Neutral
"I'm not in," Calvin says.
  Negative
He says this again and again, all through the movie: "I'm not in."
  Negative
He screams it while Bob is pushing him in a mail cart through a hail of gunfire and telling him to relax, everything's gonna be fine.
  Negative
This is their relationship.
  Neutral
And the best thing about this movie is that you believe in the relationship.
  Positive
Hart and Johnson are a classic comedy duo in the tradition of Abbott amp' Costello,  Bob Hope amp' Bing Crosby and  Gene Wilder amp'  Richard Pryor.
  Negative
And they certainly have the silhouettes for it: when the two stand side-by-side, their height difference is so great that they become iconic: the genie and the man who summoned him.
  Positive
But the film also takes them seriously as characters with dashed hopes and unrealized aspirations, men who feel things deeply even though they might not show it.
  Negative
They bicker, they yell at each other, and they get drawn into circuitous conversations about subjects that have little to do with the mission.
  Negative
Hart is playing a mid-period  Matthew Broderick character: an emotionally constipated Everyman who sounds like he's trying to be  polite even when he's hollering about some cockamamie plan  that Bob has roped him into.
  Negative
When a  burly CIA agent hands him an iPad that was supposed to show images that  would frighten and horrify him, he stares at the iPad for just exactly  the right length of time before saying, "That's PornHub."
  Negative
Bob is Calvin's id, lying to him and manipulating him to draw him into dangerous situations, but he's also his voice of conscience, urging him to act like the shining example of bravery and kindness that Bob always knew him to be.
  Negative
Johnson, who's become a fearless comic actor as well as a great action star, does the best work of his career as Bob.
  Very positive
Calvin calls him "Jason Bourne in jorts," but despite the fact that Bob can kill a man with anything, even a banana, and has a mysteriously chilly and chill quality that makes Calvin wonder if those awful stories about him are true, he's a sweetie-pie a Great Dane puppy bounding through the movie.
  Negative
Nobody in Hollywood has Johnson's aura of decency he should have played Superman and it's used ingeniously here, to allow us to like and even root for a man who is as innocently selfish as a child, a one-man wrecking crew demanding Calvin's full attention.
  Negative
"I'll never be like  Molly Ringwald," Bob laments.
  Neutral
He means it.
  Positive
And it's tearing him up inside.
  Positive
Each man embodies the other's unfulfilled fantasies of "real" success' Bob is the bad-ass knight in shining armor that Calvin was told he was destined to become.
  Positive
Bob aspires to have a relationship as stable and nurturing as the one Calvin has with his onetime high school girlfriend-turned-wife, Maggie  Danielle Nicolet.
  Negative
Calvin thinks he's a little man, in every sense a man of no importance but Bob Stone would not exist without him.
  Negative
And yet Bob is still a scared kid inside, a truth conveyed in expressionistic scenes of humiliation that replay in reflected surfaces and even behind Bob's head like a movie that Bob has literally turned his back on because he can't bear to watch.
  Positive
Bob Stone is a magnificent comic creation, a man who exhorts his friend to be the hero of his own story because it worked for Bob, and who never stops searching the text of his world for bits of foreshadowing, for signs and symbols.
  Very positive
But he wouldn't have the same impact if Calvin weren't there beside him, babbling in apprehension and improvising whopping lies while big men threaten to kill him.
  Negative
The two complete each other in an ungainly yet perfect way, like the centaurs that serve as the duo's high school mascot.
  Positive
"Central Intelligence" is written by  Ike Barinholtz,  David Stassen and  Rawson Marshall Thurber, and directed by Thurber, who also did " We're the Millers" and "Dodgeball," two of the better recent examples of the smart dumb comedy.
  Negative
It may not be a deep and complex masterpiece that will spawn symposiums and appreciations, but it is a classic of a very particular sort.
  Positive
It's the kind of movie that you watch on TV when you're supposed to be doing more important things, or experiencing more important movies, even though you've already seen it ten times, because it's still funny, and because you believe in the big man and the small man that he looks up to.
  Negative
