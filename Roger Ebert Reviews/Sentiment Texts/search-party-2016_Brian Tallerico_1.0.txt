Ive always found something morbidly fascinating about watching talented actors and actresses give their all to a project that doesnt deserve it.
  Positive
I start to try to figure out if and when they knew it was a disaster.
  Negative
Was it during the extended kidney theft urban legend bit?
  Neutral
Was it when the director asked him to play a scene in which his tights get ripped off by a Mexican woman calling herself Sarah McLachlan?
  Negative
Was it during the scene in which a child falsely accuses them of molestation?
  Negative
When did these very funny and undeniably talented TV actors know that Search Party was a disaster?
  Neutral
Delayed almost two full years since its original release date and now barely released after being out on DVD in Europe for over a year, one gets the feeling that Search Party wouldnt even be getting its minor release if stars T.J. Miller amp'  Thomas Middleditch hadnt proved such resonant comic chemistry on HBOs Silicon Valley and the always funny Adam Pally hadnt connected in films like last years  Night Owls and the upcoming Sundance hit Joshy.
  Negative
Otherwise, I imagine Search Party would have been buried in the failed comedy cemetery in which it belongs.
  Negative
One can almost see the thinking process that led to Search Party.
  Negative
Get a bunch of talented TV actors together, hire a director who has written buddy comedies  Scot Armstrong, who has a co-writing credit on The Hangover, Part II and a story credit on  Old School, and why not pick up  Tim Orr, the cinematographer from  Pineapple Express for good measure?
  Negative
It will write itself!
  Positive
No, it wont.
  Neutral
Nardo Thomas Middleditch is going to marry Tracy Shannon Woodward of Raising Hope but has a stoned conversation that leads buddy Jason T.J. Miller to believe that he should put a stop to the wedding despite the more reasonable Evans  Adam Pally protestations.
  Negative
In Hangover casting terms, Middleditch ends up being the wacky  Zach Galifianakis, Pally is undeniably the  Ed Helms, and Miller is the reckless  Bradley Cooper.
  Negative
When Jason breaks the wedding up, Tracy goes on the honeymoon anyway, leading Nardo to try to follow her to Mexico.
  Negative
Before you know it, Nardo is calling Jason amp' Evan because hes been carjacked, left naked in a small Mexican border town.
  Negative
Ignoring the advice of his co-worker Elizabeth  Alison Brie and boss MacDonaldson  Lance Reddick, Evan gets essentially hijacked by Jason to help out the third spoke in their friendship wheel.
  Negative
Along the way, they run into  Krysten Ritter Marvels  Jessica Jones, Jason Mantzoukas The League,  Jon Glaser Parks and Recreation and J.B. Smoove Curb Your Enthusiasm.
  Negative
Ive seen awards shows with less TV stars in the room.
  Negative
And yet none of them are given anything interesting to do.
  Negative
Armstrong and co-writers  Mike Gagerman amp'  Andrew Waller keep throwing their protagonists into increasingly bizarre situations in the hope something will register as funny.
  Negative
When the film gets to an EXTENDED bit that riffs on the kidney-stealing urban legend at the end of the first act, you can just watch all potential for it to become something interesting dissipate.
  Positive
This is the point that most people will change the channel on cable.
  Neutral
Its the kind of script that features a grown man lying on the floor in a moment of depression and saying Im a dirty cum rag, and cant go to Mexico without using  La Bamba,  La Cucaracha and a man covered in cocaine in the same scene.
  Negative
It eventually devolves into one of those weird, Huh?
  Neutral
movies in that I never thought Id see J.B. Smoove lick cocaine off Thomas Middleditchs face or Jason Mantzoukas shoot an arrow into Adam Pallys ass.
  Negative
But there are a lot of things here I never thought Id see that just arent funny.
  Positive
Search Party is one of those stunning failures in relation to its cast's talent.
  Positive
To their credit, Middleditch and Pally are asked to do a lot of physical comedy by their director the Silicon Valley star spends most of the movie butt-naked that still above either photoshopped in the shorts or it was an alternate take for airplane and network TV versions that will never happen and theyre always game for everything, further proving their willingness to do whatever takes to get a laugh.
  Negative
Miller, Ritter, Mantzoukas, Smoove, Brie I love this cast, even if I most certainly do not love this movie.
  Positive
In that sense, Search Party pays off on my morbid fascination, proving that even if you invite a lot of talented people to the set, the result wont work if you dont give them a way to show why theyre considered talented.
  Negative
