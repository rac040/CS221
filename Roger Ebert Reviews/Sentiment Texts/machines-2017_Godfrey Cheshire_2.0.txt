Rahul Jains Machines, a documentary about a textile factory in southern India where workers endure Dickensian conditions of -hour days for minimal pay, is a film so obedient to current academic fashions in both politics and cinema aesthetics that it ends up feeling both contrived and a bit dishonest.
  Very negative
The aesthetic part of its contrivance is evident immediately.
  Neutral
Jains camera takes us inside the operating factory and moves about it observing the workers going about their tasks in traditional cinema verit fashion.
  Neutral
The lighting is apparently all natural, which gives the environment with its dim browns, grays and greens occasionally offset by the brighter hues of manufactured fabrics a kind of macabre cast that in some moments can be strangely beautiful.
  Negative
The men who labor here, ranging from teens to middle-aged, do their work of running machines and hauling various materials with the dull regularity of automatons.
  Negative
For a while, no information is given regarding the people were watching or the place.
  Negative
Then, one worker speaks to the camera.
  Neutral
Later others will.
  Neutral
The filmmaker interviewing them is never seen nor heard.
  Negative
The men talk about their hard lives and the conditions they work under.
  Neutral
They work -hour shifts and are given no comforts.
  Negative
They must buy their own food and water.
  Neutral
Many, it seems, are poor farmers who have to travel long distances for the factory work.
  Negative
One speaks of riding a train for  hours, unable to sit down and with only crushed chickpeas to eat.
  Negative
Machines is one of those fashion-conscious docs that ends up being mildly infuriating for not supplying the basic information about its subject that most viewers will want.
  Negative
For example, here are statements from its press kit that the film itself doesnt convey:  The  billion Indian textile and garment industry, much of which operates in the informal sector and is poorly regulated, employs an estimated  million workers.
  Negative
More than  million children are engaged in child labor in India and  of the factories have no trade unions on their premises.
  Negative
Overtime practice reaches about  to  working hours a week and is mostly not paid or underpaid.
  Negative
With an average daily wage from  to , the workers take home between  and  per month.
  Neutral
Estimates of the number of people trapped in forced labor vary.
  Negative
The International Labor Organization says  million people are victims of forced labor globally, while the Global Slavery Index says there are  million slaves in the world, half of them in India.
  Negative
Such information is of course highly relevant to the world shown in Machines."
  Neutral
However, viewers who want to understand that world would be better off seeking out pertinent magazine articles or books, texts where fashion doesn't suppressed information or avoid it in the name of stylistic puritanism.
  Neutral
As its interviews continue, the film hears from people whose comments do touch on some issues that viewers are likely to wonder about.
  Neutral
Unions, which might help replace -hour stints with an eight-hour day a goal that most workers seem to fervently desire are regularly thwarted by the owners, were told.
  Negative
Any time a union movement gains steam, its leaders are eventually identified and killed.
  Negative
Later in the documentary, we see some of the people who buy and sell the fabrics the workers manufacture.
  Positive
With their sharp haircuts, nice clothes, aviator sunglasses and smartphones, they are a different order of being than those weve been observing, and they seem unthinkingly comfortable as they go about their business.
  Positive
We also hear from one factory manager whos the very picture of smug self-righteousness.
  Negative
He says he now pays his workers ten times what he did when he started out  years before, but he evidently finds them irresponsible and ungrateful.
  Negative
Only half of them, he says without offering proof, send money to their families.
  Negative
The rest fritter it away on tobacco and alcohol.
  Positive
Another thing the press kit reveals thats not in the movie: Filmmaker Rahul Jain grew up visiting a factory like this that was owned by his grandfather.
  Negative
When he went back to film, he knew some of the workers, and was given full access due to his connections.
  Positive
The very best scene here one that suggests the premise of a much better movie comes very late, when theres a crowd of workers facing the camera and, in effect, demanding to know what hes going to do with the access hes had.
  Positive
Is he going to do anything to help them?
  Neutral
If Jain had spoken to them, and incorporated his own memories and feelings about the subject into the doc rather than hiding behind the privilege of the auteur, Machines would be a much richer and more revealing film.
  Negative
But he keeps silent, leaving them to suspect that hell do no more good for them than the politicians who come through, offer empty promises, then retreat back into their privileged lives.
  Negative
