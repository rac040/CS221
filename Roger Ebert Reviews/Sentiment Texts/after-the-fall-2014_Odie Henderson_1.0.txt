Before directing his first film, After the Fall,  Saar Klein edited  Terrence Malicks  The Thin Red Line and  The New World.
  Negative
As such, one wouldnt be surprised to discover a few Malick-like touches in Kleins debut film.
  Positive
Klein sprinkles approximations of the master director throughout After the Fall, but these attempts never spring organically from the material.
  Negative
The occasional narration and the long, swirly glimpses at nature are instead hammered into a substandard crime drama that reeks of the Idiot Plot Syndrome.
  Very negative
As in Malicks work, water is a common visual motif in After the Fall, except here it is represented by that symbol of suburban privilege, the swimming pool.
  Negative
Ben Scanlon  Wes Bentley installed the pool in the hopes it would raise the property values on the New Mexico home he shares with his wife, Susan  Vinessa Shaw and kids.
  Negative
The camera imbues the pool with all manner of symbolism, first by the dreamy shots of Ben and his kids naked limbs flailing about underwater, then later in a sequence where Ben attempts to chlorine himself to death.
  Negative
The home improvement loan Ben took out for this watery deathtrap drives the plot toward crime and attempted suicide.
  Negative
Every morning, Ben fakes going to an insurance adjuster job from which he has been fired.
  Neutral
He is never seen actively looking for a job, nor does it once cross his mind that his ruse will be discovered.
  Negative
Instead, he researches closed cases in the hopes that his employer will rehire him.
  Negative
You dont even work here anymore!
  Neutral
Bens boss tells him after Ben shows up with useless new facts about a case.
  Negative
After convincingly begging for his job, Ben is shown the door.
  Negative
Ben lost his job because he thought everyone he investigated was honest, a plot point that could have yielded satisfying results had it been explored.
  Negative
After the Fall attempts to present Ben as a bastion of self-righteous honesty, but remember, hes been lying to his wife since the opening credits.
  Negative
Had he simply told the truth and either asked Susan to try a temporarily return to the workforce, or borrowed money from his snooty father in law, this movie would be over in  minutes.
  Negative
Instead, Ben has a Meet Cute with robbery, and it sends him down a suspense-deprived path of criminality.
  Negative
Ben gets the idea that he can support his family illegally when he walks in on a real estate agents illicit tryst in the house shes showing.
  Neutral
The realtor and her kept man immediately hand over their wallets it helps that Ben has a gun for reasons too dopey to explain here and a light bulb goes off over Bens head.
  Negative
Soon, Ben is robbing convenience stores, gas stations and the car pound where the repo man took his car.
  Negative
Susan is none the wiser, despite the fact that these petty larcenies barely support the lifestyle to which the Scanlons have become accustomed.
  Negative
Ben is an incredibly inept thief.
  Negative
On his face he wears the sheerest stocking this side of a high priced escorts legs, making him immediately recognizable through the nylon.
  Negative
He hits places hes been to before AND he walks in front of mirrors and cameras before he puts on his panty hose.His ineptitude is ignored by Kleins script, which not only lets him get away with the crimes but also provides him with a deus ex machina named Frank  Jason Isaacs, a cop who ensures Ben is never prosecuted despite being recognized.
  Negative
Isaacs -oclock shadow-wearing character feels ported from another, more grizzled movie.
  Negative
He slams boilermakers while sitting alone at the local bowling alley.
  Negative
He approaches strange men and asks if theyd like free beer.
  Negative
Frank has his own barely addressed side story before he meets Ben' we see him sending a birthday card to his estranged son before he breaks up a drunken bowling altercation amongst Bens friends.
  Neutral
Eventually, Frank tells Ben that he and Bens dirty cop of a Dad worked together at the precinct.
  Neutral
I knew who you were when I first saw you, he tells Ben, a miscellaneous detail thrown in to explain why Frank would befriend him in the first place.
  Negative
Theres a rather disturbing sense of privilege in After the Fall.
  Negative
It cant help but justify Bens actions by stacking the deck against the victims.
  Negative
The places he robs are staffed by people far poorer than Ben, and several of these employees are shown in a negative light pre-robbery.
  Negative
Its as if Ben deserves the right to terrorize these people rather than find a job or be truthful to his spouse.
  Neutral
His crimes are eventually pawned off on the wrong guy, and After the Fall is too cowardly to fully consider the repercussions of sending someone to jail for crimes they did not commit.
  Very negative
The sole nod to this travesty of justice is an ambiguous ending that is not as ambiguous as the filmmakers think.
  Very negative
Since we know After the Fall will never let its anti-hero get in trouble, there is absolutely no suspense during the robberies nor at home.
  Negative
When Susan finds out Ben has been fired, he does some kind of Jedi mind trick to get her to believe him instead of his employer.
  Negative
And when she finds Bens gun and stolen loot, she leaves with the kids but then inexplicably returns without question.
  Negative
Shes practically a Stepford Wife.
  Neutral
Klein goes berserk with the nods to Malick.
  Negative
Anyone whos ever complained about Malicks narration and Ive done so for The Thin Red Line, so Im guilty will think again after hearing some of this junk.
  Negative
The closing credits of After the Fall feature a thank you credit for Terrence Malick.
  Positive
It should have been an apology.
  Neutral
