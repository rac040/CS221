Australian filmmaker Genevieve Bailey hopscotched around the globe to make her feature documentary debut I Am Eleven, in which she interviews -year-old boys and girls about every topic imaginable.
  Negative
From love and marriage to war and religion to culture and the environment, they speak honestly, often humorously, and from the heart.
  Positive
Why this age, specifically?
  Neutral
Bailey explains in an opening voiceover that making the movie occurred to her during a low point in her life, and she wanted to go back to a happier time.
  Negative
For her, that was age , when the world feels big, in a good way, and it was at our feet.
  Positive
Serving as director, producer, cinematographer and editor, Bailey traveled the world and talked to a wide variety of young people in hopes of making a film thats both optimistic and real.
  Positive
Its impossible not to appreciate her desire to shine a light on corners of the planet that so many of us will never see  that so many of us would never even think to consider.
  Positive
I Am Eleven should be especially beneficial for viewers who are around this age themselves  probably even more so than for adults.
  Negative
The sense of universality it achieves should serve as a source of comfort and maybe even inspiration.
  Positive
Its a small world after all.
  Neutral
But in an effort to gather as many diverse viewpoints as possible, Bailey actually has included too many kids  , to be exact  to the extent that the impact of hearing from them becomes repetitive and diluted.
  Negative
She bounces around so quickly between all of them that theres no sense of context, no real deep connection that ever forms with any of them.
  Neutral
Theres a sameness of pacing and tone that ends up being a little dull' very little stands out substantively.
  Negative
She and her crew went to the effort to make all these treks and talk to all these kids, and surely she wanted to honor the time commitment and the trust they placed in her.
  Positive
But the result too often feels frustratingly superficial  and, to be honest, some kids are way more interesting than others.
  Positive
Take Jamira, a part-Aboriginal girl from Australia, for example.
  Neutral
Shes radiant and inquisitive and she discusses her mixed heritage while posters of  Justin Bieber and Miley Cyrus adorn the walls of her bedroom behind her.
  Positive
Or Remi, the very serious and sensitive French boy who decries his country as rich and arrogant: I am not a citizen of France, he says, his voice already changing.
  Neutral
I am a citizen of the world.
  Neutral
Or Billy, a hilarious and sweet-natured Londoner whose accent is so thick, Bailey thought he required subtitles.
  Neutral
Apparently somewhere on the autism spectrum the film doesnt specify, but his father alludes to the great developmental progress hes made, Billy has immediate and outspoken opinions on everything from soccer to girls to the  Dirty Dancing movies.
  Negative
He likes them because they have great dancing moves, and plus nice romance.
  Positive
Or Siham, a Moroccan girl whos surrounded by kids of various ages, all of whom are living in a small village in poverty.
  Neutral
She smiles nervously as she tells her interviewer: We are only poor people here.
  Negative
But she also shares that she likes studying, sports and travel.
  Positive
These are among the kids whose experiences stick with you, the ones the film could have dug more deeply with to let us get to know them better.
  Positive
These are rich, enlightening, moving stories.
  Very positive
But too often, Bailey presents them as a series of talking heads on a particular topic, briskly skimming when stopping and chatting a little longer would have been more powerful.
  Negative
A group of girls in an Indian orphanage are essentially interchangeable, we get to know so little about them as individuals.
  Negative
Same with Osama and Sahin, the two Iranian boys living in Sweden who want to be rappers.
  Negative
How often do you see that combination on film?
  Positive
Now thats different.
  Neutral
Bailey has achieved the purpose she set out at the films start.
  Negative
Shes made a film thats optimistic, ultimately.
  Positive
But it would have benefitted from being a lot more real.
  Negative
