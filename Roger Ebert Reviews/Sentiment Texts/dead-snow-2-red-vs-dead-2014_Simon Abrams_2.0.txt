Like so many other post-" Shaun of the Dead" horror-comedies, the execution of  "Dead Snow " is rarely as funny as the concept.
  Negative
Norwegian director  Tommy Wirkola and his two co-writers do virtually nothing with their  sequel's most novel twist: what if you made zombie Nazis fight zombie  Communists?That joyfully moronic question is answered in a comically  drawn-out battle royale.
  Negative
But, until then, viewers are stuck watching  unmoving human protagonists like Martin  Vegar Hoel, the only living  survivor of " Dead Snow," prepare to take on a horde of goose-stepping  flesh-eaters.
  Negative
All creative roads lead to the film's big climax, and the  jokes scattered along the way are usually not outlandish enough to make  "Dead Snow " memorably funny.
  Neutral
Then again, you will probably enjoy "Dead  Snow " if you're amused at the thought of zombie Nazis grunting,  stabbing, and Sieg-heil-ing their way through a Sam Raimi-inspired  gross-out comedy.
  Neutral
It's for-horror-nuts-only, but if you can see it with a  rowdy crowd, "Dead Snow " will appreciate exponentially.
  Neutral
In  a tellingly timid introductory recap, "Dead Snow " gently reminds  viewers what happened in "Dead Snow:" Hitler-worshippers, led by Colonel  Herzog Orjan Gamst, killed six of seven thrill-seeking co-eds during  an ill-timed visit to a Norwegian cabin.
  Negative
Martin previously thought his  undead, bigoted assailants were after a cache of gold that he and his  friends kept for themselves.
  Negative
But now, after returning the zombie Nazis'  gold, Martin realizes that Herzog and the gang won't go away until they  fulfill Hitler's last command: punish a nearby Norwegian village for  their wartime efforts.
  Negative
To stop Herzog, Martin enlists the help of the  Zombie Squad including  Martin Starr, a trio of geeky American survivalists that have spent  years preparing for a zombie apocalypse.
  Negative
But when Herzog's numbers prove  too great, Martin uses a supernatural severed arm he cut off Herzog's  body, and raises his own army.
  Negative
Turn back now  if you're not already chuckling.
  Negative
The makers of "Dead Snow " rely  heavily on the inherent absurdity of their film's premise, and expect  you to do the rest.
  Negative
Several comedic scenes that rely on pregnant pauses are funny, especially scenes starring "Sidekick Zombie"   Kristoffer Joner, a rapidly-deteriorating, Nazi-fighting tourist that  Martin raises from the dead.
  Negative
But the sight of monsters grunting, and  killing zealously while dressed up as World War II cos-players is only  so funny since"Dead Snow " generally isn't mean enough.
  Negative
In any  other type of film, the fact that the Zombie Squad's members are  ostensibly sympathetic would be a good thing.
  Negative
But they're so gawky and earnest that you keep expecting, nay, hoping that one of them gets  dispatched by a brain-nibbling anti-semite.
  Negative
Daniel Martin Starr, a  greasy, trenchcoat-clad geek, is the most obnoxious of the group.
  Very negative
He  squeals with delight when he first discovers that he is, after years of  fantasizing, capable of destroying zombies.
  Positive
But, after that, Daniel's a  hatchet-chucking killing machine, which is only so much fun to watch.
  Negative
"Dead  Snow " picks up when it is nasty enough to be silly.
  Negative
Overkill is the  nature of the film's " Evil Dead"-inspired comedy Martin's severed hand  is an ostentatious nod to Raimi's earlier horror film.
  Neutral
So the scene  where Martin wipes away a hail of vomit in order to gawk at zombies  through a closed window is funny.
  Positive
Also, it's rare, but Wirkola and co.
  Positive
do right by their preposterous stars by making them pose like  punch-drunk pro-wrestlers on their way to a steel cage match.
  Neutral
But  once the adrenaline dies down, you're left with technically-assured,  but lifeless confrontations that are only as charming as they are funny.
  Negative
There should be more quips as satisfying as "I didn't know there was an  ugly face convention in town," and there aren't.
  Negative
The makers of "Dead  Snow " only fly their freak flags at half-masts, so their  helium-high-concept comedy often looks like something Beavis and  Butthead's Scandinavian cousins would make.
  Negative
