Kim A. Snyder's feature-length documentary "Newtown" establishes this right from the start by flashing images of a parade in the town's main thoroughfare baton twirler, uniformed cops and then bringing in audio of a  call from a police dispatcher asking for backup during the massacre, which claimed the lives of  elementary-school aged children and six teachers.
