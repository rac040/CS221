I, Daniel Blake is an extremely  Ken Loach-y Ken Loach film, for better and for worse.
  Positive
The surprise winner of the Palme dOr at this years Cannes Film Festival follows a middle-aged, blue-collar carpenter struggling to navigate the bureaucracy of the British benefits system after an injury leaves him unable to work.
  Negative
Aside from some glimmers of humor early on, it is relentlessly bleak and not terribly subtle as it attempts to create an abiding feeling realism.
  Negative
But Loachs film also features some stirring performances and a strong sense of place in its depiction of working-class Newcastle.
  Very positive
Stand-up comedian  Dave Johns, starring in his first feature film as the title character, has an everyman directness that makes him instantly relatable before we even see him.
  Negative
We hear him first, over the opening titles, answering ridiculous, circular questions from a government health-care agent that dont get to whats really ailing him: his heart.
  Negative
With his thick, musical accent, Daniel cant help but respond with humor and incredulity in the face of such cluelessness.
  Negative
Who hasnt felt the same frustration, whether its with the bank, a utility company or our own health insurance provider?
  Neutral
But this truly is just the beginning for Daniel, who runs into an even more maddening battle when he physically goes to the benefits office with the hope that an actual human being might help him.
  Negative
Heres where the veterandirectorand his collaborator of many years, screenwriter  Paul Laverty, undermine their very worthwhile point, though.
  Positive
Except for one unusually kindheartedwoman, they depict all the employees there as monsters, from security guards to case analysts to managers.
  Negative
Its a pretty black-and-white situation without a whole lot of room for shading.
  Positive
While hes there, however, Daniel meets a youngwomanwhos in an even direr financial situation than he is: Katie  Hayley Squires, a single mother who recently moved to town with her daughter and son because they couldnt afford to live in London anymore.
  Negative
Katie dreams of returning to college and getting a degree, but in the meantime she goes door-to-door seeking house cleaning work and forgoing dinner so her kids can eat.
  Positive
For the most part, Loach depicts her plight in matter-of-fact fashion but with obvious appreciation for this characters sacrifices.
  Negative
Her welfare claim rejected, Katie goes with great shame to a food bank to feed her kids in the films most quietly powerful scene.
  Negative
Subsequent acts of desperation, however, become increasingly melodramatic and maudlin.
  Negative
But the friendship that develops between Daniel and Katie is rooted believably mutual sympathy, compassion and respect.
  Very positive
Daniel, a widower with no children of his own, comes to function as a father figure to the kids and a much-needed handyman in the familys dilapidated apartment.
  Negative
In return, the gregarious but obviously lonely Daniel gets to enjoy their company, including a pleasingly platonic relationship with Katie.
  Positive
The sweetness and simplicity of their arrangement is the films chief bright spot in an otherwise complicated world.
  Very positive
Returning to filmmaking after saying he was retiring in , the -year-old Loach rails against the system with his trademark style of stripped-down social realism.
  Neutral
Despite the films deliberate pace, quiet tone and intimate camerawork, his rage is unmistakable.
  Negative
His drive to tell the stories of ordinary citizens is clearly as strong today as its ever been, and he isnt interested in letting anybody off the hook with a happy ending.
  Positive
Escapist cinema, it is not.
  Negative
But with I, Daniel Blake, Loach is using the medium for one of its most crucial purposes: to shine a light on injustices he sees all around him, as well as on our capacity for human decency.
  Positive
