One thing needs to be cleared up right away.
  Neutral
This movie is a quirky fantasy-adventure-comedy co-written and directed by  Bill Watterson, in his behind-the-camera debut.
  Positive
Before you get all excited, it must be clarified: Not THAT Bill Watterson.
  Negative
The semi-reclusive Calvin and Hobbes creator has not made his way to Los Angeles to pursue a new vision that only the cinema can contain.
  Negative
No, this Bill Watterson is a film and television actor in his early s, two conditions that do inform this movies vision.
  Neutral
The movie begins with video footage of the title character, who asks of the folks behind the camera interviewing him that they not make him look angry and spineless.
  Negative
Apparently this is the aftermath of Daves project, an in-apartment maze labyrinth is the more accurate term, Dave insists, and he has proof that he made simply because, as he puts it, I wanted to make something.
  Very positive
And apparently the thing he made has gotten a couple of people killed.
  Negative
A title sequence shows Dave  Nick Thune to be a creative type a to-do board on one wall of his place instructs him to Finish Concept Album.
  Positive
But what he does instead one afternoon is construct a cardboard castle in his living room.
  Negative
His girlfriend Annie  Meera Rohit Kumbhani comes home and Dave instructs her not to enter the thing.
  Negative
Its bigger and deeper than she knows and hes stuck in it, trying to find a way out.
  Negative
He asks her to call his best friend Gordon  Adam Busch for assistance.
  Negative
When Gordon arrives, he and echoey Dave launch into a bit of struggling-Hollywood-bro banter, or at least thats what I assume it is.
  Negative
Wheres that beard at?
  Neutral
Dave shouts.
  Positive
The beard is on the face, Gordon responds.
  Negative
Gordon has a beard, you see.
  Positive
Anyway, running counter to Daves directions, Annie has also invited all of Daves friends over.
  Negative
They all look like theyre headed for a Dan Zanes concert but forgot to bring the actual children for whom the concert is in fact intended.
  Neutral
Among these folk is a camera crew these are the characters who interview Dave, not after the adventure but in the middle of it.
  Negative
The all-live action section of this movie is lit and shot almost exactly like an episode of The Adventures of Pete and Pete.
  Negative
Thats not a bad thing in and of itself, but as relatively swinging as it was, The Adventures of Pete and Pete was a childrens show.
  Negative
Once the party turns into a rescue party, and Daves pals all enter the labyrinth against his strident objections the videographer yells Dont look at the camera, just like in  Apocalypse Now, ar ar ar, things get a little more visually interesting.
  Negative
Since the maze labyrinth, sorry is made of cardboard, the attendant visual effects, most of them in-camera, are deliberately low-tech and funky.
  Negative
There are gear-heavy booby traps.
  Positive
Characters are beheaded, or beheaded, but when they are, streams of red wool thread shoot from their necks.
  Negative
Theres a part of the labyrinth in which the characters transform into cardboard hand puppets.
  Negative
Theres a section in which the characters turn to black and white.
  Neutral
At this juncture, Annie forgets how mad she is at Dave long enough to join him and Gordon in doing bad impressions of  Robert De Niro in  Raging Bull.
  Negative
Theres even a zoetrope.
  Neutral
Its all very Hipster Etsy.
  Neutral
Keeping things tense is a Minotaur, some guy the filmmakers probably picked up around Golds Gym and put a cardboard horned head on.
  Negative
I was wondering who exactly this movie was made for, and how I could avoid them, when in the middle of the picture Dave expels a cri de coeur, tied into the I wanted to make something riff.
  Negative
He says he hates the fact that I still get money from my parents and I bore them, which is so on the money I almost felt bad for the guy.
  Negative
This feeling dissipated as this movie, a  Fantastic Mr. Fox for artisanal yogurt connoisseurs, ended, with a song called Pinball, by the band Tandemoro.
  Negative
Sippin my beerplayin pinballyeah goes the chorus.
  Negative
Listening, I had never felt happier to be approaching senior citizenship.
  Negative
Come back Mumblecore, all is forgiven.
  Negative
