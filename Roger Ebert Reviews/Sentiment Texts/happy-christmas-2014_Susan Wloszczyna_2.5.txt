Jenny, an attractive -something woman whose middle name might as well be trouble, moves in with her Chicago-based gainfully employed brother, Jeff, his stay-at-home novelist wife, Kelly, and their delightful dumpling of a -year-old son after breaking up with her boyfriend.
  Negative
She bunks in their basement, whose s-style thatch-happy Polynesian dcor is a dumpier version of Disneys Tiki Room attraction.
  Negative
Its a hipsters dream and anyone elses nightmare.
  Negative
Upstairs, it is painfully clear this couple in their s are burdened by the weight of domestic drudgery.
  Negative
They have misplaced their youthful spark and suppressed their romantic urges.
  Neutral
Downstairs, a well-stocked vintage bar beckons the new inhabitant, who likes to party to the point of blackouts.
  Positive
Add the fact that the childs male baby sitter is a pot dealer and a member of a noise band whatever that is but it cant be a good thing, who is attracted to feckless Jenny and you can probably guess much of what happens during the course of Happy Christmas, including an omnipresent holiday tree.
  Negative
One glance at the static camerawork that plagues the entirety of Happy Christmas and you might also discern that this is a minimalist mumblecore production, a kitchen-sink-style indie genre that apparently outlaws long shots or close-ups.
  Negative
Another hint: It is directed by  Joe Swanberg, a mainstay of mumble-dom who also plays Jeff.
  Negative
There is an upside to this particular Swanberg opus.
  Positive
Almost nearly a decade after his filmmaking debut, he has done well enough with his improvised small-budget dramadies he helped  Greta Gerwig break into the non-mumbling mainstream to attract name-brand talent.
  Positive
He at least exhibits the good taste to bring together  Anna Kendrick who also appeared in Swanbergs " Drinking Buddies" last year and is always pitch-perfect in my book as Jenny' the too-long under-the-radar  Melanie Lynskey the New Zealand actress who deserved the same kind of breakout that co-star  Kate Winslet enjoyed after their debuts in s " Heavenly Creatures" as Kelly' and  Lena Dunham as Carson, Jennys more level-headed friend who is a less abrasively assertive twist on Dunhams Hannah on TVs "Girls."
  Negative
The core inter-generational conflict of lifestyles isnt unlike a knock-off of "Neighbors" minus the prank-filled feuding.
  Negative
Much as that comedy allowed room for  Rose Byrne to swagger her stuff, Swanberg is smart enough to let female interaction be the driving force behind "Happy Christmas."
  Neutral
It might take a while for Jenny and Kelly to connect on any level, but once they do, the movie lights up like Rudolphs nose.
  Negative
Kelly bolsters Jennys confidence by dropping her guard and offering her acceptance.
  Positive
Jenny, meanwhile, is intuitive enough to know that Kelly is frustrated by not having the time to write and suggests she tries penning a quickie erotic bodice-ripper to make some easy money.
  Negative
The scene where the three women combine forces to invent a seduction scene where the novels heroine imagines losing her virginity is a corker, filled with revealing frankness that is maybe worth the price of admission.
  Positive
Swanberg clearly knows the naturalistic give-and-take among this perceptive trio is pure gold tinsel.
  Positive
So much so, there is even a reprise of the segment done with additional material during the end credits.
  Negative
Also pulling his weight is Jude, Swanbergs real-life son, as Kelly and Jeffs toddler.
  Positive
This chubby charmer doesnt need to chew the scenery to please.
  Positive
All he has to do is to shove fistfuls of Cheerios into his mouth to elicit smiles.
  Negative
If you are averse to shambling plots that go out of their way to avoid tying everything up with a tidy emotional bow, then this title is not for you.
  Negative
But for those who find the weekly arrival of another new CG-engorged blockbuster at this time of year to be the cinematic equal of a re-gifted pair of socks, they might enjoy the modest if shaggy pleasures of this slice of Christmas in July.
  Positive
