I came out of the press screening of " The Signal" half-impressed and half-irritated, and the reason Im giving the movie three stars instead of the two-and-a-half a large part of me believes it has earned is because Im not quite sure what Im more irritated with: the movie or myself.
  Negative
Why I would be irritated with myself is tied in with the inescapable fact that, if youre going to check out "The Signal," the second feature directed by  William Eubank, youre best off going in with as little information as possible.
  Negative
The movie, co-written by the director with Carlyle Eubank and David Frigerio, is a science-fiction thriller that looks, from the outset, as if its down for some is-the-computer-hacker-a-serial-killer antics.
  Negative
The movie kicks off with its young protagonist, Nic, who looks too fit to be on crutches, giving a claw-crane tip, or cheat, to a young kid in a convenience store.
  Negative
Nics a bit of a wunderkind, as is at least one of his traveling companions, best bud Jonah  Beau Knapp.
  Positive
Perhaps less so is Nics girlfriend, Haley  Olivia Cooke, who Nics accompanying to her new school in California.
  Negative
The college circumstances, and Nics progressively debilitating physical condition, create a big question mark for his relationship with Haley.
  Positive
Also providing distraction on the trios road trip is a pesky computer hacker who calls himself Nomad, who performs feats of server meltdown and surveillance that make Nic and Jonah green with envy, not to mention annoyance.
  Negative
So once theyve got a bead on this prankster, and discover that the location of that bead is merely a detour away, they persuade Haley to make the side trip and check it out.
  Negative
What ensues is a near-" The Blair Witch Project" style scene of found-footage scares in a seemingly deserted desert shack.
  Negative
Nic and Jonah explore the place, which is as run down as any dirt farmers abode, except for some brand spanking new server racks in the places basement.
  Negative
And then kaboom!
  Positive
A few events occur that force a movie reboot, if you will, and the setting shifts to an underground bunker.
  Negative
Nic is wounded, disoriented, doesnt know where he is or what happened' hes interrogated by a fellow who identifies himself as Damon played with his patented combination of reassurance and sternness by  Laurence Fishburne and who wears, as does everyone else in the facility, a space suit.
  Negative
The highly alarmed and confused Nic learns that he could very well have been the victim of an "EBE," that is, an Extraterrestrial Biological Entity.
  Negative
Sounds icky, and judging by the black stuff that sometimes turns up on the walls of the very clean facility, it is.
  Negative
And heres where Id better stop giving up plot information.
  Negative
Suffice it to say that "The Signal" continues to get weirder, and creepier, and to bring up unusual questions for the viewer.
  Neutral
Such as, why does Fishburnes character use a cassette recorder to interview Nic?
  Negative
And whats with the bright red briefcase with a pistol in it?
  Positive
Well, you will find out.
  Negative
Eubank, who is also a cinematographer, clearly had a blast concocting this movies shifting, unpredictable but quite internally consistent design, which makes the plots multiple convolutions extremely effective.
  Negative
Once the pictures over and all or at least the most significant questions are answered, its possible that a certain amount of disappointment will set in.
  Negative
I generally never go into a movie with the aim of outsmarting it, but the denouement of "The Signal" left me not just with a gratifyingly flummoxed "Why didnt I see that coming?"
  Negative
feeling but also a naggingly empty one.
  Negative
Thats what I meant about irritation' an irritation I didnt feel about, say,  Duncan Jones maybe equally tricky " Moon."
  Negative
In any event, Eubanks talent is not at all in doubt, and science-fiction mavens who embrace this picture will rightly be excited for whatever he turns to next.
  Negative
