As he's aged,  Michael Douglas has grown less and less sleazy.
  Negative
This is a disappointing fact of life for anyone who associates Douglas with films like " Basic Instinct," " Disclosure," or " Wall Street."
  Negative
Which isn't to say that his recent performances aren't satisfying.
  Negative
Douglas is amply charming in challenging roles like Liberace in "Behind the Candelabra" and Ben Kamen in " Solitary Man."
  Positive
But watching Douglas behave like a narcissistic scumbag is an absolute pleasure, one in which viewers of action-adventure "Beyond the Reach" can happily indulge.
  Negative
Douglas plays Madec, a deranged poacher who winds up hunting Ben  Jeremy Irvine, a skillful human tracker, across the Mojave Desert.
  Positive
With a high-powered rifle in his pleathery hand and a pair of orange-lens aviator sunglasses around his craggy face, Douglas is in his element.
  Negative
He doesn't have to try too hard to be menacing: he just is, as you can see when he nails a hysterically overblown line like "Fool me once?
  Negative
Shame on you.
  Negative
Fool me twice?
  Negative
I kill you!"
  Neutral
"Beyond the Reach," a chase movie that loses momentum about two-thirds of the way through, runs far on Douglas's fumes.
  Negative
The secret to Douglas's indomitable charisma is that, while he's always on the verge of blowing it, he almost never loses his behind-gritted-teeth cool.
  Negative
At the beginning of the film, Madec is a prideful blowhard.
  Negative
He's from Los Angeles, and is therefore clueless and very rich.
  Positive
He's also a natural genetic foil for Ben, a young working-class hero with principles and bills to pay.
  Positive
Ben initially tamps down his skepticism when Madec tries to bribe and bluster his way through the private hunting trip he handsomely pays Ben to take him on.
  Negative
But something inevitably goes wrong, and Madec turns on Ben, leaving Ben to avoid bullets, the sweltering sun, and other harsh natural elements.
  Negative
I call bullets a natural element since "Beyond the Reach" never once strays from its generic narrative or characterizations.
  Negative
Which is fine, since director  Jean-Baptiste Lonetti "Carr Blanc" and screenwriter  Stephen Susco, the latter of whom based his screenplay on Robb White's novel "Deathwatch," do a fine job with the type of story they chose to tell.
  Positive
Lonetti and Susco know that they're in the realm of airport-friendly pulp, and deliver on that level.
  Negative
The film's plot moves along smoothly, and doesn't dwell too much on Ben's backstory he misses his girlfriend and can't afford college!
  Negative
, or Madec's background as a cut-throat businessman he's selling out to a bunch of Chinese businessmen!
  Positive
.
  Neutral
Instead, "Beyond the Reach" myopically focuses on Madec's hunt, a strategy that works until Ben is forced to confront Madec directly, and the film consequently loses its momentum.
  Negative
At that point, it becomes clear just how much Douglas has been carrying the film.
  Negative
Lonetti and Susco wisely tamp down the most inherently flamboyant aspects of Douglas's character.
  Negative
Madec is, after all, a guy that drives a tank-sized jeep, complete with portable martini bar, industrial-grade flood-lights, and a lounge chair that comes equipped with a handset-controlled loud-speaker.
  Negative
He's desperate enough to be absurd, but not absurd enough to be the source of belly laughs.
  Negative
So when he tries to make Ben laugh by making an out-of-the-blue allusion to " Wall-E," you can hear the desperation in Douglas's voice as Madec repeats his weak Wall-E imitation until Ben relents, and laughs just to get the older man off his back.
  Negative
Douglas's performance is such a perfect fit for his simultaneously flinty and silly material.
  Positive
He impatiently squints and sighs his way through the film's corniest dialogue, like when Madec puffs out his chest and boasts about his achievements: "I'm no amateur, kid, and I've got the horns to prove it: elephant, rhino..." That kind of smarmy double entendre is a Michael Douglas special, delivered with consummate ease and without any unnecessary mugging.
  Negative
The best part of Douglas's performance is that it's not even the focus of "Beyond the Reach."
  Positive
Madec essentially controls the film's narrative, so Douglas is realistically inescapable.
  Positive
But the rest of the film is slight but serviceable.
  Positive
Scenes where a surprisingly adequate--and never-not shirtless--Irvine silently navigates the desert are mostly compelling, though Lonetti doesn't really know how to film Madec's car when it's on the move, and the film's cross-cutting-heavy chase scenes are distractingly over-edited.
  Negative
Then again, any scene without Madec is inherently less exciting.
  Negative
If you watch "Beyond the Reach" hoping for some cheap thrills and a juicy Michael Douglas performance, you won't be disappointed.
  Negative
