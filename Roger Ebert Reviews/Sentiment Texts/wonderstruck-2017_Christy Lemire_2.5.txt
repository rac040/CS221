Despite what the title suggests, Wonderstruck represents a rare disappointment from master filmmaker  Todd Haynes.
  Negative
Its gorgeous, of course, with all the sumptuous lensing, rich sense of place and meticulous eye for period detail weve come to expect and luxuriate in from the director of Far From Heaven and  Carol.
  Positive
And its certainly ambitious from a narrative perspective as it jumps back and forth between two mysteriously connected stories one of which is entirely wordless.
  Positive
But the emotional payoff just isnt there, despite a lengthy build-up of cosmic proportions, which ultimately renders the entire effort a twee exercise in style over substance.
  Negative
Its Haynes most accessible work for a broad audience, though and its definitely the only film hes made that younger viewers can see so maybe itll inspire folks unfamiliar with him to seek out his more challenging fare.
  Negative
Based on the novel of the same name by author and illustrator  Brian Selznick, whose The Invention of Hugo Cabretinspired  Martin Scorseses fanciful  Hugo, Wonderstruck follows the adventures of two kids who run away to New York City,  years apart, seeking answers and a sense of peace.
  Negative
Both are lonely and isolated' both are plucky despite their troubled homes.
  Negative
They also both happen to be hearing impaired.
  Neutral
But they manage to find allies and figure out a way to survive through their resourcefulness and as Selznicks script not so subtly suggests a healthy heaping of magic.

Who hasnt found one of those?

  Negative
Wonderstruck alternates between Bens story and that of a sweet, shy girl named Rose living in Hoboken, New Jersey, in .
  Negative
Shes been deaf since birth as is the expressive newcomer playing her,  Millicent Simmonds.
  Negative
But she longs to connect with actress Lillian Mayhew Haynes regular  Julianne Moore, a film star at the tail end of the silent era, with whom shes obsessed.
  Negative
Rose dares to leave the comfort of her pampered home life to board a ferry for the big city across the Hudson River.
  Neutral
But Rose at least knows someone in Manhattan: her older brother, Walter  Cory Michael Smith, who works at the American Museum of Natural History.
  Positive
Ben, you will not be the least shocked to learn, ends up at the same museum  years later climbing the same stairs, perusing the same exhibits and hiding from the same kind of security guards who suspect both kids are up to no good.
  Negative
In each case, the immersive visuals are far more compelling than the kids overly simplistic stories.
  Positive
Working once again with cinematographer  Ed Lachman, costume designer  Sandy Powell whos also an executive producer on the film and production designer  Mark Friedberg all masters Haynes recreates two extremely different visions of New York hustle-and-bustle in astonishing, vivid detail.
  Positive
Each section plays like a film that might have come out during their respective eras.
  Negative
The  story is told in grainy black and white without dialogue as a reflection of Roses reality' the boldly percussive score from frequent Coen brothers composer  Carter Burwell punctuates particular moments in dramatic, unsettling ways.
  Negative
Meanwhile,  is full of faded oranges and greens and teems with danger and squalor.
  Negative
When Ben steps off the bus and enters the Port Authority terminal alone, in the middle of the night, carrying everything that matters to him in a backpack you can feel the grit and grime emanating from the screen.
  Negative
The trash scattered everywhere is so prevalent and tactile, its practically a supporting character.
  Negative
But the friendship Ben strikes up with a similarly lonely kid named Jamie  Jaden Michael provides a warm and welcome contrast.
  Positive
Pity, then, that the movies many sweet individual moments and the increasingly tiresome back-and-forth structure dont add up to much.
  Negative
A climactic scene that takes place at the Queens Museums Panorama of the City of New York a massive, painstakingly crafted model of the metropolis in miniature provides a breathtaking sight.
  Positive
But by the time we arrive there and it takes a loooong time to arrive there, the secrets in store are essentially a foregone conclusion.
  Positive
Haynes is still using his formidable abilities to explore the universal need for human connection, though  which is a wonderful thing, even in less powerful form.
  Positive
