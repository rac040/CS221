Johnny Saxby, the protagonist of  Francis Lees impressive feature directorial debut, Gods Own Country, is a difficult character to like for quite a while.
  Positive
When first we see him, hes hunched over a toilet bowl, contending with the semi-dry-heaves that are familiar to alcoholics and younger fellows with delicate stomachs.
  Negative
Johnny may be one or the other, or both.
  Neutral
In any event, puking is not a good look for him, particularly in cold rural morning light.
  Negative
Once in repose, or something like it, Johnny initially theres no way of getting around this brings to mind the phrase I think I first heard in a Monty Python sketch, that is spotty-faced git.
  Negative
Johnny is the scion of a small farming family in Britains Pennine Mountains, a Northern region of England.
  Negative
When I say small farming family, I mean it: he is the only son of Deidre and Martin, two older folks who look as if rural existence has beaten the life out of them.
  Negative
Father Martin is in fact disabled, hobbled after a stroke.
  Negative
This leaves Johnny to look after the livestock, and the looking after of the livestock is portrayed in vivid detail.
  Positive
If you are made squeamish by Explicit Calving Action, and the aftermath thereof, this might not be a movie for you.
  Negative
Aside from carrying the weight of the farm on his shoulders which he does poorly Johnny has another issue.
  Negative
Hes gay, which one infers does not go down well either with his immediate family or the extremely lumpen residents of the tiny town where Johnny goes for his drink.
  Negative
Johnnys world is shaken up a bit when Gheorghe, a Romanian immigrant with extensive experience and competence in tasks Johnny seems entirely indifferent to, arrives to temp at the farm.
  Negative
Gheorghe is handsome, confident, friendly.
  Very positive
All of which annoys both Johnny and Martin no end at first.
  Neutral
Once Gheorghe and Johnny get to work at an area of the farm far removed from the main house, their seeming hostility to each other gives way to something else.
  Neutral
Once theyve made love in the mud, they begin to bond.
  Negative
An unusual kind of Eden conjures itself up.
  Positive
The animals start to thrive or at least do better under Gheorghes tender, knowing ministrations, and Johnny himself opens up.
  Positive
He not only starts smiling more, he actually gets better-looking.
  Negative
Gods Own Country is a tricky movie, but not in a way thats dishonest.
  Negative
Its first feet are in the school of miserablist realism, and while director Lee never abandons his things-as-they-are approach, he tells a love story by letting magic in at unusual angles.
  Positive
Most of which involve, yes, Gods own country, a ravishing landscape captured beautifully by the cinematography of Joshua  James Williams.
  Positive
The land can be contended with, inhabited, but it cant ever be tamed, is what the images tell us.
  Negative
So too it is with life itself.
  Negative
After Johnnys father suffers another stroke, Johnny and Gheorghe have to face the question: do they have the conviction to try and make their situation, both personal and professional, permanent?
  Negative
Homophobia is not the only potential issue here.
  Negative
When Johnny take Gheorghe to his local pub, Gheorghe is disrespected by a xenophobic older townie.
  Negative
The what will Mom think issue is actually resolved in a way thats surprising and moving, as is so much in the movie.
  Positive
Gods Own Country asks a lot of its actors, physically and emotionally, and they come through.
  Positive
Josh OConnor navigates Johnnys soddenness and transformation with exceptional sensitivity.
  Positive
As Gheorghe,  Alec Secareanu brings matinee-idol looks, easy charm, and palpable thoughtfulness to bear.
  Positive
Gemma Jones and  Ian Hart play Johnnys parents, and despite a two-decade age gap between the actors, they are perfectly matched and in a sense, unrecognizable' they could very well be rural folks discovered by the director.
  Positive
The movies denouement was ever so slightly sentimental for my tastes, but overall this is a pretty exceptional find' a solid story about how committing to what you believe in requires finding out what you believe in first.
  Positive
Sounds simple, but its not.
  Negative
