"Treading Water" is a weird and funny coming-of-age story about a boy who has the normal teenage problems: an overbearing mother, an indifferent father, no love life ... and he also has a condition called Trimethylaminuria, otherwise known as "fish odor symptom."
  Negative
Trimethylaminuria is an endocrinology disorder, where the body doesn't produce certain enzymes, resulting in a "fish smell."
  Negative
The film originally was called "The Boy Who Smells Like Fish," showing the story's fable-like structure, but that was given up in favor of a more generic title.
  Negative
The fact that writerdirector Analeine Cal y Mayor has created a whimsical little comedy out of a boy who goes through life smelling like fish is one of the main delights of "Treading Water."
  Positive
Cal y Mayor takes a light touch, bordering on the surreal.
  Positive
The movie doesn't quite hold together at times, and some of the darker elements like what it feels like to be shamed and shunned at every moment of your life are soft-pedaled.
  Negative
But it has a strange charm nonetheless.
  Negative
Douglas Smith plays Mica, who enters this world smelling of fish the doctor in the delivery room scrunches up his nose as he hands the baby to the mother.
  Negative
Mica's parents are played by  Ariadna Gil and  Don McKellar "Slings and Arrows" fans will remember his turn as the ridiculously pretentious guest-director Darren Nichols.
  Negative
Worried about why their son smells so bad, they take him to a round of doctors and quacks and gurus, who suggest using a specific soap, or who do weird rituals over his head in a candle-lit room.
  Negative
As the child grows, he is bullied at school.
  Negative
He knows he smells so he spends most of his time soaking in the bathtub, sometimes submerging himself completely where he swims around in a dreamy blue world of freedom.
  Negative
By the time Mica is a teenager, his father has abandoned the family, and Mica has isolated himself, spending most of his time at the local pool.
  Negative
He wears an air-freshener around his neck.
  Negative
He talks about his life with his therapist Carrie Anne Moss.
  Positive
He has a crush on a girl he met at the pool  Zo Kravitz, who remembers him from grade-school.
  Negative
He hesitates to pursue her.
  Positive
Because he smells.
  Positive
Yes, it is all a bit silly, and the silliness is underlined by the house in which Mica and his mother live.
  Positive
It is the home of a famous Mexican singer named Guillermo Garibai  Gonzalo Vega, turned into a museum.
  Neutral
Mica's mother gives tours.
  Neutral
The walls are covered with kitschy portraits of Garibai and framed gold records, and the decor has not been updated since Garibai lived there in the late s and early s. To walk from the living room to the kitchen you have to swerve around all of the velvet ropes.
  Negative
Garibai fans show up at the door in small groups, dressed to the nines, sporting beehive hairdos and colorful dresses.
  Positive
If you've visited Graceland, you know the type.
  Neutral
Garabai was their hero, their heartthrob, and they Ooh and Aah over every "relic" saved in the house, even a broken cologne bottle, preserved under glass.
  Negative
Mica grows up with people wandering randomly through his bedroom "and this is the room where Garibai was inspired to write his most famous song", interrupting his bath time.
  Negative
Elisa Sauve was the production designer and the set of that house is such a weird and loopy environment that it automatically signals that none of this should be taken lt'igt'toolt'igt' seriously.
  Negative
Yes, the poor boy smells like fish and he has no friends, and yes, all of these bad things happen to his mother and father, but get a load of that house!
  Very negative
Cal y Mayor lt'igt'milkslt'igt' that set.
  Negative
She finds every bit of humor possible in having her lead character live in an environment devoted to the idolization of the Mexican Elvis whose hey-day was  years before.
  Positive
Mica and Laura's romance is tentative.
  Positive
Both of them are keeping secrets from the other.
  Neutral
But nothing is too intense.
  Negative
The romance is not the greatest love of all time, and Mica is more of a passive recipient of events rather than an active participant, a problem with the performance.
  Negative
His stakes always seem pretty low.
  Negative
He has accepted his lot in life.
  Positive
He smells like fish.
  Negative
There is no cure.
  Neutral
Mica continues to swirl around underneath the water in the pool, freed up from the dry-day world that recoils from him.
  Negative
The whimsy of the directorial style helps save "Treading Water" from being a Disease of the Week television movie.
  Positive
"Treading Water" reminded me a bit of Arvin Chen's bittersweet comedy "Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow ?"
  Positive
about a gay man who decides to get married and live as a straight man.
  Neutral
A serious topic, filled with emotional mayhem, but Chen filmed it as a brightly-colored fable, romantic and cinematic, complete with dream sequences and choreographed musical numbers, people opening red umbrellas and floating up into the sky like Mary Poppins.
  Very positive
The emotions underlying the events are intense, tragic even, but the mood ends up being one of a yearning attempt at human connection.
  Positive
"Treading Water" is not quite as successful in walking that delicate line of mood and tone, but it still has a lot to recommend it.
  Positive
