We tell ourselves stories in order to live,  Joan Didion once said.
  Negative
And yet, watching Misconduct, a twisty but exceptionally bone-headed one might even say cretinous legal thriller, sitting through its story hardly felt like living.
  Negative
The movie begins with  Anthony Hopkins as powerful pharma bigwig Denning having an intense spat with trophy girlfriend Emily Malin Akerman, something about if-you-dont-do-X-I-will-do-Y, as is the custom.
  Positive
Emily goes off in a huff and Denning soon gets a text with a picture of Emily with a busted lip.
  Negative
Oops, shes been kidnapped, and soon Denning is consulting with a hostage-negotiation expert played by  Julia Stiles.
  Negative
Soon Denning is in an art gallery with a duffel bag containing a couple million in small denominations, and he winds up punching out a guy who everybody in the movies circumscribed world, and outside of it, automatically knows is just a doofy art dealer.
  Negative
So far, so Okay and a shrug.
  Positive
Then, theres a cut, and a title comes up reading One Week Earlier.
  Negative
One suspects that this movie, written by  Simon Boyes and Adam Mason, who were also behind s Junkie and directed by  Shintaro Shimosawa, making his helming debut after dutifully co-producing some Grudge movies and several must-avoid TV series, underwent a little tinkering prior to its coming out, because the flashback structuring serves no purpose except to open the movie with a relatively flashy sequence of events featuring several of its bigger names.
  Negative
In One Week Earlier land we are stuck for a while with  Josh Duhamel, hotshot low-man-on-the-pole in a big-time law firm.
  Negative
Hes just gotten an estate settlement for a widow whose deceased left no will, so hes clearly got skills, but theres also his best pal the computer hacker.
  Negative
Its not cheating if the good guy wins, Ben smirks at one point.
  Negative
Later in the movie, a friend, entrusting Ben with a gun, tells him If the cops catch you with this, theyre gonna shoot first and ask questions later.
  Negative
The dialogue is just filled with little gems like that.
  Negative
Anyway, Ben soon receives several communiqus from the self-same Emily we saw standing up to Anthony Hopkins.
  Negative
Shes an old girlfriend of Bens, and she offers him several varieties of forbidden fruit: the standard-issue carnal variety, and a file of e-mails that prove that her bossboyfriend lied egregiously about a disastrous drug trial.
  Very negative
The married Ben refuses to have sex with Emily the scene in which he does so is accompanied by a shockingly kitschy musical theme, by Federico Jusid, that wouldnt sound out of place in a s Shannon Whirry softcore picture but concocts a hare-brained scheme to bring down Denning using these highly-illegally-obtained e-mails.
  Negative
What could go wrong?
  Neutral
Ben makes his pitch to his firms boss.
  Neutral
Thats none other than  Al Pacino, sporting a goatee dead giveaway there and deploying an outrageous Southern accent the movie is set in Louisiana, although it lacks for any kind of regional character whatsoever also, whatever happened to Shannon Whirry?
  Negative
I wonder sometimes.
  Neutral
Mixing things up, narrative-wise, are Bens wife, Charlotte  Alice Eve a busy nurse still suffering after the loss of an unborn child sometime earlier, and a mysterious, motorcycle-riding Asian man who himself suffers from a wasting illness when hes not randomly menacing, it would seem, a quarter of the films cast.
  Negative
Eves portrayal of Charlotte is so unyieldingly catatonic that you have to admire its commitment even as you wonder about its ultimate intent.
  Positive
Byung-hun Lee is credited with playing The Accountant in the films end credits, although you have to have paid super-hard attention to understand just why.
  Negative
Such a ragged and desultory muddle is Misconduct.
  Negative
When the movie, in its coda, takes a plot point from a pretty famous L.  Scott Turow novel and expects the audience to be taken by this twist, well, I cant speak for anybody else who might be unlucky enough to see this, but I myself no longer had the energy to be insulted.
  Negative
