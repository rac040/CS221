Fourteen years after  Barbershop," Calvin  Ice Cube and his motley crew of hair-cutters are still shaping up the kitchens of their South Side Chicago clientele.
  Negative
The third installment of the series, subtitled The Next Cut," drops most of the original cast into a timely story about gang violence and the power of a neighborhood bonding together.
  Very positive
As Eddie Cedric the Entertainer, the shops raucous provocateur said in the first film, the barbershop is a place for people to feel safe expressing their thoughts and ideas.
  Negative
Writers  Kenya Barris black-ish and  Tracy Oliver extend this notion, turning Calvins into a gang-neutral safe zone in response to a political measure designed to wall in the neighborhood.
  Negative
That measure is in response to rising statistics of violence, and is being championed by former employee, Jimmy  Sean Patrick Thomas.
  Negative
Jimmy has traded in his clippers for politics, a perfect match for the holier-than-thou persona we remember from the first film.
  Positive
Just like everything else that gets mentioned in the barbershop, Jimmys idea is met with intense discussion, pro and con.
  Positive
Eventually, someone suggests using Calvins as a safe zone for a -hour truce between rival neighborhood factions.
  Negative
During the truce, haircuts will be free for anyone.
  Negative
Barber Jerrod  Lamorne Morris sets up a social media hashtag, and the main story of Barbershop: The Next Cut is set in motion.
  Positive
Like its predecessors, this is an ensemble piece.
  Positive
Central to the story is Calvins son, Jalen Michael Rainey, Jr., a teenager chafing under the rigid rules of his parents.
  Negative
He and his pal, Kenny Diallo Thompson feel the deceptively alluring pull of joining the local gang, and much of the films suspense hinges on whether the duo will succumb to temptation.
  Positive
Calvin and his wife, Jennifer Jazsmin Lewis sense Jalens potential seduction into violence, and believe, as many parents do, that he is being led by his friend rather than being followed.
  Negative
This creates some well-acted scenes of tension between Calvin and Kennys dad, Rashad Common.
  Negative
Rashad is married to my favorite holdover characters from the original, Terri Eve.
  Negative
Hes taken over her chair while she hobnobs with celebrities in her high-profile job.
  Positive
Still yelling about her apple juice and swinging enough attitude to host VH Divas solo, Terris appearance ushers in the rowdy, no-holds-barred spirit that permeates the scenes inside the shop.
  Negative
Debate topics fly, and the most politically incorrect responses continue to rain from the mouth of Eddie, the shops elder statesman.
  Positive
You may remember the huge controversy over Eddies hilariously inappropriate comments about Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Rosa Parks in Barbershop," and that was before Twitter existed.
  Negative
Who knows what fresh Hell Eddies current, equally hilarious and inappropriate comments will unleash now that social media abounds?
  Positive
While its first sequel let viewers journey back into the history of the shop, Barbershop: The Next Cut offers a vision of the future.
  Positive
The original all-male client sanctuary has given way to a unisex place of business.
  Negative
The female banter of the beauty salon has merged with the macho bluster of the barbershop' now both parties get to hear the complaints that normally went unsaid when they were together.
  Negative
This dynamic gives the back-and-forth comedy an extra dimension of humor and insight, playing to the strengths of director  Malcolm D. Lee.
  Very positive
What fascinates me about Lees work, even in his less successful efforts, is his focus on the examination and deconstruction of the societal structures of African-American masculinity.
  Negative
In films like the superior The Best Man and its sequel  The Best Man Holiday," Lee bends his characters perceptions of themselves at odd angles, exposing the internal and external challenges placed upon them.
  Negative
Sometimes he nods in solidarity with them, and other times he calls them on their b.s. with a heaping dose of tough love thats often issued by his female characters.
  Negative
His ability to funnel these explorations through a mixture of comedy and drama is his strongest directorial quality.
  Positive
It helps Barbershop: The Next Cut sail smoothly through its few unsuccessful moments.
  Positive
The original cast is supplemented by several newcomers, most of whom come from the Kenya Barris-Malcolm D. Lee stable of actors.
  Negative
Regina Hall is great as Calvins partner, Angie, and shes given a nice serious scene to compliment her expected comic mastery.
  Positive
Common brings a sense of grace under pressure to his scenes with Eve and especially Ice Cube.
  Positive
Cube remains a great straight man, charitably letting the comedians bounce off his stoicism.
  Neutral
He also gives some of his best dramatic scenes since his heartbreaking turn in  Boyz N the Hood."
  Positive
Conversely, I wish more had been done with  Nicki Minajs character.
  Negative
Shes fine in the role, but its written in such one-note fashion that she never feels as real as everyone else.
  Negative
Barbershop: The Next Cut belongs, as the entire series does, to Cedric the Entertainer.
  Negative
His Eddie is the quintessential definition of a supporting character, and back in Barbershop," his performance was Oscar-worthy.
  Positive
Convincingly playing much older than he actually is, Cedric the Entertainer infuses his character with the perfect timing of a comedian and the generosity of someone who wants to pass on life lessons to his younger colleagues.
  Positive
Theres a mischievous twinkle in his eyes whenever he says something horrible, but if you look closely, youll also see genuine concern in them when hes not joking.
  Neutral
In every film, theres a scene where Eddie talks seriously about a situation, and those scenes are some the best ones in the series.
  Positive
As for his comedic moments, the coda in this film may be his finest one.
  Positive
For all its humor and the film is quite often laugh-out-loud funny Barbershop: The Next Cut never loses sight of the gravity of its primary situation.
  Positive
Calvins fear for his sons well-being is a palpable one that any parent, regardless of race, can identify with.
  Positive
The threat of violence is never treated in comedic fashion a scene between the heads of rival gangs inside Calvins is as tense and terrifying as any drama youll see.
  Negative
And even when the film threatens to get downright preachy and a bit too on-the-nose, it never loses its pull on the viewer.
  Negative
Sometimes we need a good sermon, and like the best of sermons, Barbershop: The Next Cut dispenses its message with enough humor and wisdom to inspire and linger after its done.
  Positive
