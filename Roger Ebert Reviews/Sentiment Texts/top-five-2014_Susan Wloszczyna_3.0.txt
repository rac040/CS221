Ragged around the edges and haphazardly hilarious though it may be,  TopFive ultimately satisfies as an often raunchy ramble about celebrity, sobriety, selling out and sex, courtesy of the immensely talented but too-often subpar movie star  Chris Rock.
  Positive
As befits this comedian who rarely feels the need to censor himself while riffing onstage or sounding off in an interview, there is both a frankness and a personal investment in this, his third directorial feature-film effort, that was sorely missing in s  Head of State and s I Think Love My Wife.
  Positive
The need for rigorous honesty a tenet insisted upon by Alcoholics Anonymous is mentioned at some point and it often applies to what shows up on screen, too.
  Negative
Being on the brink of  can push an artist to take a good hard look at their career.
  Positive
And Rock probably doesnt want to have his film legacy be ultimately summed up by a handful of lowbrow  Adam Sandler comedies and three stints as a chatty cartoon zebra in the  Madagascar franchise, as profitable as those outings might have been.
  Negative
So he reaches for  Stardust Memories self-reflection along with some  Before Sunrise-style walkabouts around Manhattan as a day-in the-life version of himself: a brilliant stand-up comic turned hack Hollywood movie clown named Andre Allen like Rock, once declared The Funniest Man in America by Time magazine, who is exhibiting all the signs of a midlife crisis.
  Negative
I dont feel funny, Andre tells an assistant.
  Positive
And who would after satisfying a hungry bottom-feeding public in a trio of monster-hit cop-buddy romps in an animal getup as Hammy the Bear?
  Neutral
His catchphrase during arrests?
  Neutral
Its Hammy time!
  Neutral
Its akin to  Tom Hanks playing Hooch instead of Turner while donning a mangy dog costume.
  Negative
However, his choice to go legit with Uprize!
  Neutral
, a wrongheaded historic epic about a slave revolt that results in a sea of dead white people, doesnt look as if its going to turn his frown upside-down despite his hopes that it will become the Haitian answer to Django Unchained.
  Negative
Making matters worse is his having to engage in satellite radio interviews and a full-on press junket while answering the same inane questions repeatedly, especially about whether there will be a Hammy the Bear .
  Negative
As someone who has experienced this medieval media ritual numerous times, what Rock presents cuts pretty close to the truth especially when some of the more notorious journo junketeers show up unbilled hey, its Stephen Schaefer!
  Positive
.
  Neutral
Adding to Andres misery is a pending tabloid wedding to a demanding and desperate Bravo reality star  Gabrielle Union, stunning in her shallowness that clearly is more of a publicity stunt than a fairy-tale relationship.
  Negative
What is likely to get the biggest rise out of audiences including some who may bolt for the exit are the outlandish bouts of randy antics.
  Negative
They include a flashback depiction of Andres self-declared rock-bottom moment fueled by a booze binge.
  Negative
It involves Cedric the Entertainer as a sleazy Houston concert promoter cavorting with two hookers amid a storm of pillow feathers in the comics hotel room, and, afterwards, the sight of Rock uncomfortably curled up in a fetal position as to avoid the massive stains left on his bed sheets.
  Very negative
The only sequence that can topthat is an act of revenge that involves the insertion of a hot-sauce-soaked tampon where the sun doesnt shine.
  Negative
But for all that down-and-dirty business, what I most appreciated about  TopFive was the very human and adult connection between Rock and  Rosario Dawson as a New York Times reporter named  Chelsea Brown, who is doing a profile on Andre by trailing him for the day.
  Negative
Most filmmakers barely know how to capitalize on Dawsons talents other than to fill up the screen with her goddess-like beauty.
  Negative
But Rock treats her single mom who boasts a checkered romantic past along with strong opinions as an equal sparring partner, and even starts the film with a cold opening of the pair strolling the city streets while debating the state of the world.
  Positive
Yes, some of the ethical questions involved in this relationship that go beyond the attraction they eventually share end up being quite troubling if not ridiculous.
  Negative
But the palpable natural rapport between the two actors goes a long way to mask such flaws, including Chelseas reaction to Andres conspiracy theory that the original  Planet of the Apes was linked to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.
  Negative
TopFive also benefits from a parade of cameos, with Rock capitalizing on his considerable showbiz connections to recruit an amazing lineup of name talent in small roles.
  Very positive
That includes  Kevin Hart as an agent who provides a short yet pungent phone rant, JB Smoove as a bodyguardchauffeur,  Ben Vereen as Andres dad,  Sherri Shepherd as his ex-girlfriend and a pre-accident  Tracy Morgan as an old acquaintance.
  Negative
There is a tender undercurrent to the raucous goings-on, which includes the jokester trifecta of  Whoopi Goldberg,  Jerry Seinfeld and Adam Sandler as themselves while attending Andres bachelor party at a seedy neon-lit strip club.
  Negative
Eavesdropping on these comics as they discuss the virtues of pre-nups and offer marital tips to the man of honor is pure gold.
  Positive
As for the films title, it is derived from a party pastime where players rank their all-time favorite rappers along with a sixth alternate.
  Negative
If you were to list " TopFive"s best surprises, No.
  Negative
might be an appearance by a notorious gangsta rapper with a long history of arrests who croaks  Charlie Chaplins heartbreaking anthem  Smile while behind bars.
  Negative
Earlier, Andre describes Chaplin as one of his influences: He started this shit hes the KRS-One of comedy.
  Negative
Slapstick and sweetness.
  Positive
Raunch and romance.
  Positive
As a filmmaker, Rock has finally found the yin to go with his yang.
