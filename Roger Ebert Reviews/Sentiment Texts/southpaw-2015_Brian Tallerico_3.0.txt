Boxing isnt a sport of surprises.
  Positive
Its not about who can throw the most original punch or dodge in a brand-new fashion.
  Negative
Like so many sports, its about mastering techniques and repeating those moves more fluidly than the competition.
  Negative
And so the familiarity of  Antoine Fuquas Southpaw feels almost appropriate for the subject matter.
  Negative
There are so few narrative surprises in this traditional tale of a boxer felled by personal tragedy who rises again to save the one person in his life who matters to him that one can pretty much map out the entire venture from the preview.
  Positive
And yet not every film needs to reinvent the wheel.
  Negative
Working from almost exactly the same template he did on Sons of Anarchy a show that  verged on Greek tragedy and also presented men who exist in worlds of violence and are often undone or saved by their children writer  Kurt Sutter plays with the very familiarity that will drive some critics away but comfort viewers looking for an old-fashioned tale of redemption.
  Negative
As I wrote about "Sons of Anarchy" two years ago, "Watching characters, with whom we can identify, persevere through the proverbial fire allows us to believe we can surmount comparatively minor obstacles in our own lives."
  Negative
The exact same thing applies to "Southpaw."
  Neutral
The increasingly remarkable  Jake Gyllenhaal transforms himself yet again as Billy Hope, a boxing champion near the end of his career.
  Positive
Southpaw opens with an atypically difficult fight for the champ, one that goes into the late rounds and leaves him battered and bloodied.
  Negative
His wife, Maureen  Rachel McAdams, encourages him to take a break.
  Positive
As she warns him, two more years of this and hell be punch-drunk and unable to spend time with the most important person in his life, his daughter Leila a breakthrough child performance from  Oona Laurence, genuinely in the moment in every scene.
  Negative
Billy doesnt know much outside of boxing.
  Neutral
He grew up in child services, which is where he not only met Maureen but the posse of friends who hang around after fights and encourage his rise to fame.
  Negative
As often happens in the world of boxing, a newcomer wants a shot at the King.
  Positive
Miguel Escobar Miguel Gomez is a younger, more agile fighter who shouts at Hope after press conferences that he wants his time in the ring.
  Negative
Promotermanager Jordan Mains Curtis  Cent Jackson doesnt want to schedule the Escobar vs. Hope fight yet, trying to get a few more wins and their accompanying cash payouts in the books.
  Negative
Hope wants the big match, but everything changes when a physical altercation between the often-violent pugilist and the rising star ends in gunfire.
  Neutral
When the smoke clears, Maureen has a bullet-sized hole in her stomach and Billys life has been forever changed.
  Negative
Hes been barred from the only thing he knows, spirals into suicidal behavior, and risks losing his daughter forever.
  Negative
Can he rise again?
  Neutral
On Sons of Anarchy, and even The Shield, for which he was a formative writer, Kurt Sutter examined the intersection of aggression and emotion.
  Negative
Men like Jax Teller and Vic Mackey were willing to cross lines of violence to save those they loved and their ways of life.
  Negative
In many ways, Billy Hope falls into this lineage.
  Negative
He is a man who has had a tough upbringing and knows little more than how to fight and love two elements of human existence that many people would think are on different ends of a spectrum but that Sutter has always presented as living in unison in some men, especially those who have had to fight their entire lives.
  Negative
When everything that matters to Billy Hope is taken away from him in one instant, he doesnt so much shift gears as rebuild the essence of who hes always been, going to a new trainer named Tick  Forest Whitaker and trying to find his center.
  Negative
Sutter recognizes that men like Hope or Teller for that matter are at their best when they are committed and devoted to what drives them.
  Negative
Gyllenhaal gets that too.
  Neutral
In the ring, he plays Hope as a force of nature, screaming into the camera, blood intermingling with spit that hits the lens.
  Negative
Outside of the ring, Gyllenhaal recognizes that men like Hope are often insecure, even shy when theyre talking about personal, emotional things.
  Negative
Look at how Gyllenhaal carries himself differently with the boys in his entourage, Jordan, his wife, and, eventually, his new trainer.
  Neutral
In scenes of potential redemption, such as when hes talking to Tick or Leilas case worker  Naomie Harris, he lowers his gaze, almost like a child hoping to get the answer that he so desperately needs.
  Negative
Again, Gyllenhaals physicality says more about the character than anything in the film.
  Negative
Just as he did in  Prisoners and  Nightcrawler, Gyllenhaal makes daring, confident decisions.
  Positive
He has quietly turned into one of our most physically confident actors.
  Positive
And its nice to see his strong work here matched by an excellent turn from Whitaker as well.
  Positive
Sadly, too much of the rest of the ensemble other than Laurence feels like a plot device, especially Harris case worker.
  Negative
Director Antoine Fuqua is no stranger to stories of the dangers of macho male aggression, and he proves to be a good fit with Sutter.
  Positive
His style is aggressive, often placing us in the middle of a fight, literally getting punched by an opponent.
  Positive
It can be a bit too frenetic and I do think theres a stronger version of Southpaw that catches its breath a bit more often to find the character beats outside of the ring.
  Negative
Theres a brief moment when Billy tells Tick, My wife would have liked you, thats the kind of human interaction that the film could have used more of in the end.
  Negative
I also think Sutter cuts a few corners in the second half, particularly with a troubled inner city youth that Tick and Billy try to help who could have been named Plot Device thats how thinly written and cheap his subplot feels.
  Negative
There are more boxing movies than any other sport.
  Negative
Why is that, especially in an era when the real sport is declining in popularity?
  Negative
Its because of the intrinsic relatability in fighting for something getting in the ring and trying to defeat not just an opponent but personal demons.
  Negative
Southpaw enters the long filmography of boxing flicks, and puts up a surprisingly good fight.
  Positive
