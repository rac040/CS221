The Chilean director Pablo Larrain gives the impression of aspiring to intellectual curiosity, political engagement, and committed anti-triviality.
  Negative
What a person aspires to and what he or she actually achieve are frequently extremely different things.
  Negative
Ive seen three of Larrains features so far No,  The Club, and this one, about the Chilean poet and political figure and the only thing I can say about him with near-absolute subjective certainty is that hes a persistently humorless filmmaker.
  Very negative
Andrew Sarris had a category for guys like this: Strained Seriousness.
  Negative
Neruda, directed by Larrain from a script by  Guillermo Caldern, begins in Chile just after World War II, and shows its title subject, a portly, bald-pated man who is not just a celebrated poet but also a Senator, enjoying all the perks of both positions.
  Very negative
In the gigantic mens lavatory of the Senate building, he waxes pedantic to his colleagues.
  Negative
In his spacious house he hosts orgiastic costume parties' he dresses up as T.E. Lawrence at one.
  Negative
When asked to recite, he goes to a default verse, a famous one.
  Positive
As he performs grandiose and shallow postures, another presence makes itself known.
  Negative
In voiceover, an unseen enemy speaks of Neruda and his confreres: They do not know what it is to sleep on the floor, but they are all red.
  Negative
The railing against the Limousine Left is coming from a police detective named scar Peluchonneau, an anti-Communist whose sneers at Neruda and his kind will help fuel him once hes assigned to arrest the poet after a government shakeup that turns circumstances against Neruda and his fellow Communists.
  Negative
The portrait of Neruda that continues is very different from the kindly poet depicted in the once-popular film fable Il Postino' this movie gives Neruda his teeth back, while at the same time lording it over him.
  Negative
Seemingly obliged to seek exile even as he aches to speak on behalf of his countrys oppressed, he vacillates between bravery and peculiar cupidity.
  Negative
As he flees Peluchonneaus dogged pursuit, he baits the policeman, sending him genre novels and making his varied escapes in a deliberate nick-of-time fashion.
  Negative
Once Peluchonneau catches up with Nerudas wife, Delia, the woman has a surprise for him.
  Positive
Peluchonneau is not real, she tells him' he is a supporting character created by Neruda himself, to make the story of Nerudas escape from Chile that much more thrilling.
  Negative
This revelation throws the detective for a loop, to say the least.
  Positive
And the movie itself takes Delia at her word, depicting Peluchonneaus mission in ever more melodramatic movie-movie fashion, depicting him goggled, riding in a motorcycle sidecar with bad mountainous-landscape rear-projection imagery behind him shades of  Guy Maddin.
  Negative
Larrain has cited the Argentinean fabulist Jorge Luis Borges as an influence, but this isnt really Borges style of meta' and in any event a character becoming aware of his own fictional status goes back to  Lewis Carroll if not farther.
  Negative
The point of it all being that history and poetry are not possible without personified antimonies, real or imagined.
  Negative
Neruda does not make this point in any particularly convincing way, despite excellent performances by  Luis Gnecco as the title character, a stolid  Gael Garcia Bernal as his pursuer, and  Mercedes Morn as Delia.
  Negative
Neruda is, like all the Larrain films Ive seen, laudable in its ambitions and ultimately unsatisfying in its execution.
  Negative
