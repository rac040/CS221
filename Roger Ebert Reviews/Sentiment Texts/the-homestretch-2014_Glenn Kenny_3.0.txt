"The Homestretch" opens with a bleak statistic: Two to three thousand homeless children walk the streets of Chicago every night.

The movie pauses, its conventional night shots of streets and its conventional acoustic-guitar led score filling the few seconds, asking the viewer to let that fact sink in.
  Negative
What do you do with that fact when you read or hear it?
  Neutral
Do you immediately politicize it?
  Neutral
Do you reflexively ponder what might be wrong with the individuals who have no home, and why its probably their fault?

Its an interesting time to consider questions like those' its never not, but now its particularly interesting, lets say.

Soon after the statistic, one of the three main subjects of the movie is heard saying: Is this the life Im gonna live the rest of my life?
  Negative
Directed by Anne De Mare and Kristen Kelly, The Homestretch immediately shifts from statistic to specific, telling the stories of three homeless kids, each one trying to complete a level of education thatll give them a leg up in adult life, which seems to be coming at them like a rushing train.

Immediately anticipating the what-did-you-do-to-deserve-this question certain viewers are likely to ask in an accusatory tone, Roque and Kasey are introduced grappling with Shakespeare' Roque tells of how he relates to Hamlet because of his mothers behavior after his father was deported on account of an immigration issue.

The movie is a production of Kartemquin Films, the Chicago-based company founded by the filmmaker Gordon Quinn, the director of Home For Life and the executive producer of  Hoop Dreams.

Homestretch has a narrative structure not dissimilar to Hoop Dreams, but at about  minutes it doesnt have the epic sweep.
  Neutral
It doesnt mean to.

Its intimacy is a reflection of its compassion and its brisk directness is in the mode of a police bulletin: this situation is a problem, the viewer has to multiply Raque, Kasey, and Anthony by a thousand to understand how big the problem is in just one American city.
  Negative
The Homestretch invites you to empathize with its subjects, to worry with them, to laugh with them, to worry about them.
  Positive
Its engaging and compelling viewing.
  Positive
But it ends on an implied call to action, telling of a facility for servicing homeless kids that lost funding, was eventually able to reopen, but now still has to turn away an average of  young people every night.
  Negative
After watching the movies subjects brave the harshness of a Chicago winter, the message that this is fifteen young people too many couldnt be clearer.
  Negative
There is no such thing as society, Margaret Thatcher once famously said, addressing expectations that government do something about issues such as homelessness.
