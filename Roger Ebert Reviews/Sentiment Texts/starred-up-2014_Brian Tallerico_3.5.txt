From the very first shot, theres tension humming underneath the phenomenal Starred Up that only intensifies as the characters deepen.
  Negative
The opening shot is shaky, reflecting both movement and the disorientation that comes with change.
  Negative
And the eyes of Jack OConnell, a future star if ever Ive seen one, are tight and coiled, first looking down to gather his thoughts and then glaring up at the unknown future of his destination.
  Negative
We see this young man going through the process of moving from juvenile care to being admitted to an adult prison, and it ends with his hands on his head and face.
  Negative
From there, in a new cell hell occupy for what feels like a long time, he does push-ups, he crafts a shiv, he paces like a caged animal all before a single line of dialogue.
  Negative
Director  David Mackenzie trusts his actor and OConnell puts more performance up there on the screen in body language than most performers do with an entire script.
  Positive
Its almost ten minutes before he speaks and even that, to be fair, is so heavily accented and mumbled that Im not sure I could tell you what he says, but we know Eric already through visual composition, physical performance, and the other tools that average films often ignore in favor of over-expository dialogue and false declarations of emotion.
  Negative
Starred Up is not an average film.
  Negative
Its hard to describe Starred Up without making it sound generic.
  Negative
Its another prison drama, a genre that felt exhausted many, many years ago.
  Negative
And its another tale of a genetic predisposition for violence as we soon learn that Erics father Neville the great  Ben Mendelsohn of The Place Beyond the Pines and Animal Kingdom is in the same prison as his son.
  Negative
Neville first spies Eric across the yard and glares him down in the way a disappointed parent does before a beating.
  Negative
Eric has been thrown into an ultra-violent, alpha male world, and its not one where having your father around is necessarily a good thing.
  Negative
Human connection, for both of these men, will prove to be a double-edged sword.
  Positive
In many ways, its a work about a fathers anger that both protects and derails his son.
  Negative
Eric will have another father figure in his life, a group therapist named Oliver  Rupert Friend, who convinces the prison Governor Sam Spruell to give the young man a chance at rehabilitation after a particularly violent incident.
  Negative
In group sessions that almost always end in outbursts and violence, Oliver does his best to try a different parental tactic with Eric.
  Positive
Theres a defining scene in which Eric flouts authority by lighting up a cigarette in group and Oliver tries discipline verbal admonition and essentially putting the group in a time out before Neville bursts in with the physical response: Problem is youve got to come down on him full throttle' else it wont register.
  Negative
Its corporal punishment versus detention even in the prison system.
  Negative
The dynamic between a biological father and a father figure behind bars is fascinating' both men try to protect him and both simply cannot in this kind of world.
  Positive
While all of that subtext makes Starred Up fascinating, it is primarily a character piece for the young Mr. OConnell, an actor who reminds one of  Tom Hardy in  Bronson or the early work of  Ryan Gosling in his fearlessness.
  Positive
Theres a scene early on in which Eric knows the guards are coming for him.
  Neutral
He races back to his cell, pours oil on the floor, and then douses himself in the stuff too.
  Positive
Itll make it harder to take him down.
  Neutral
And he grabs a couple of wooden planks for good measure.
  Neutral
Hes not getting out.
  Neutral
They have nightsticks, helmets and shields.
  Negative
But hell do some damage on his way down.
  Negative
Starred Up is a film about someone sliding out of society, and kicking, screaming and punching as he does so.
  Very positive
And OConnell captures that in a way that so many more experienced, well-known actors would miss.
  Positive
Its in the incredible physical balance between prison-earned toughness and youth.
  Positive
Theres just a hint of fear in OConnells eyes, reminding us that he was just a kid not that long ago.
  Negative
OConnells performance is matched but never upstaged by the increasingly fantastic Ben Mendelsohn, an even more blatantly conflicted blend of rage and familial concern, and Rupert Friend.
  Positive
Starred Up is HEAVY with slang and accents.
  Negative
You wont understand a third of it.
  Neutral
But theres so much going on in between the lines of dialogue that you wont care.
  Negative
Weve seen many visually arresting films in recent years and character studies are as common as film festivals, but its the remarkable blend of the two here that makes Starred Up devastating.
  Positive
From Mackenzies camera choices often tracking in one shot from relative calm like inmates playing ping pong to an outburst in the distance down the hall to the sound design of clanking metal doors and distant cries, Starred Up is a technical achievement anchored by the clarity of character in OConnells performance.
  Positive
Its fantastic.
  Very positive
