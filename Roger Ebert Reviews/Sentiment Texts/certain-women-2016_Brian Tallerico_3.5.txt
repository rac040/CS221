A drama teacher once told me that great drama is about the most important day in the life of the protagonist.
  Positive
Even if it was a generalization designed to teach a student how to bring gravity to a performance, its often true, but not always.
  Neutral
Great storytellers can make great drama from seemingly average days in their characters lives, sometimes offering even more insight into the human condition by transcending the mundane than highlighting the abnormal.
  Positive
There are several average days in  Kelly Reichardts sublime Certain Women, an adaptation of three short stories by  Maile Meloy.
  Positive
Working with the most high-profile cast she has to date, Reichardt delivers a multi-faceted character study, a sketch of intersecting lives in a small Montana town.
  Positive
It is purposefully slow, a film meant to be lived in and considered carefully when its done.
  Negative
Almost none of it feels as important as my teacher explained and yet it is still great drama.
  Neutral
Certain Women opens with a train moving slowly through the heartland of Montana, honking its horn occasionally along the way.
  Negative
We will hear that train again, blaring its horn in the background of these characters lives, both connecting them in our subconscious and serving thematic purpose.
  Negative
Reichardt returns to images of life going past this mountain town trains, freeways in the distance, a flowing river to remind us of both the ordinary nature of these stories and to connect them to each other and even our lives.
  Positive
The first of three barely interlocking stories opens with a lawyer named Laura Wells  Laura Dern on her lunchtime affair with a married man named Ryan  James Le Gros.
  Negative
She returns to her office to find her most annoying client, a man named Fuller  Jared Harris, who wont take her legal advice that he doesnt have a disability case against his former employer because he took money from them after the accident.
  Positive
It turned out to not be nearly enough money but it derailed any future legal action.
  Neutral
She takes him to a male colleague in a neighboring city, who tells him the exact same thing, but he listens this time.
  Neutral
Reichardt is subtly laying thematic foundations about the ways in which people interact with each other female attorneys and male clients, husbands and wives, teachers and students.
  Positive
After Fuller does something drastic that serves as the only real action of Certain Women, we transition to the story of Gina Lewis  Michelle Williams, wife to Ryan, the man we met earlier getting dressed with Laura.
  Negative
The effect of that earlier scene is subtle but crucial because we bring baggage to this second story by virtue of the fact that we know that this isnt a healthy marriage.
  Negative
It looks like everything is relatively fine, but Ryan is cheating.
  Positive
So when we see them working on a house theyre building from the ground up, we know the foundation is a little weak.
  Negative
Gina, Ryan and their daughter are camping on the site, next to a river, where their home will be built.
  Negative
On the way home, they stop off at the house of an elderly man named Albert  Rene Auberjonois, from whom they want to buy a pile of sandstone.
  Negative
Albert hesitates at first, melancholic over his original plans to use it for something that never happened.
  Negative
The gender dynamics here are crucial to understanding the scene as Albert will only speak to Ryan, making Gina more aggravated.
  Negative
Finally, theres the third story of Certain Women, which could stand alone as one of my favorite short films in years.
  Negative
Lily Gladstone stars as Jamie, a ranch hand living on her own on an isolated farm.
  Neutral
Her only friends seems to be the adorable dog who runs alongside her tractor, although Jamies life is not presented as a miserable one.
  Negative
Its just an existence in which not much changes to day to day.
  Neutral
And then she stumbles into a class on school law being taught by a woman named Beth  Kristen Stewart.
  Negative
They go out to eat and strike up a friendship and Beth becomes the break from the norm that Jamie needs.
  Negative
Every one of these stories has a sense of inevitability, like that river moving through the heartland.
  Positive
Whether its a disgruntled client who sees no way out of his predicament, a man who closes a chapter in his life when he parts with his sandstone, or the daily grind of working on a farm.
  Negative
These are normal people, like you and me, and its that relatability that makes Reichardts work here so powerful.
  Positive
Every single character, even the minor ones, feel like they exist before they come into frame and keep going long after.
  Negative
If anything, its the male characters who reach finality the female ones keep moving forward to the next client, project, and day on the farm.
  Positive
Perhaps theres something of a statement there.
  Neutral
Thats for you to decide.
  Neutral
As for performances, this could be Reichardts best work to date.
  Positive
Again, theres such a lived-in quality to Derns approach or Harris frustration or Gladstones quiet emotion.
  Negative
Williams, a regular Reichardt collaborator, gets the least satisfying of the three narratives, but the final  minutes, which also features spectacular work from Stewart, more than makes up for it.
  Positive
Theres so much internal monologue in Reichardts approach.
  Negative
Its more about what Jamie doesnt say to Beth or what Laura stops herself from saying to Fuller that makes the movie work.
  Neutral
We see so many films in which characters are constantly expressing exactly what they think and feel in ways that no one does in the real world.
  Negative
Its because most filmmakers are afraid of silence.
  Neutral
Kelly Reichardt knows that so much can be said with silence.
  Positive
It can even be the subject of great drama.
  Positive
