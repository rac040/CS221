The presence of a new Cinderella, the latest of a long line of TV and theatrical movies about the fairy-tale lass and one lad, if you count  Jerry Lewis in s Cinderfella, caused me to realize that there seems to be a change in the attitudinal wind when it comes to popular entertainment.
  Positive
The cynical side winks, knowing smirks, throwback references and dead-pan jokes that are hallmarks of post-modern culture are being ever so politely nudged aside by an emerging re-appreciation of old-fashioned sincerity and the pleasures of simply playing it straight.
  Positive
Basically, warmth is slowly becoming the new cool.
  Positive
One of the first signs of this turnabout might have been  Tim Burtons approach to last years  Big Eyes, a biopic about Margaret Keane, the mid-century kitsch queen of the art world, and her struggle to regain credit for her work from her con-man husband.
  Negative
Given the inherent creepiness of Keanes waif portraits, many expected Burtons humorously sinister sensibilities to seep into the beatnik-era clash of low art and high drama.
  Negative
But save for a couple Twilight Zone-style dream sequences, the filmmaker adhered to telling the true story pretty much as it happened and focused on building sympathy for its main subject.
  Positive
This apparent sincerity revival went global when it arrived in the form of  Lady Gagas Oscar-night performance of a medley of Rodgers and Hammerstein songs in honor of The Sound of Musics th anniversary.
  Negative
No one would blame anyone for expecting the pop singer, known for such outlandish stunts as donning a meat dress at an MTV awards show, to inject some ironic commentary about the sentimental classic into her performance.
  Negative
A bikini-wearing nun smeared with schnitzel with noodles would not have been out of the question.
  Negative
Instead, Gaga materialized as a lilting vision of loveliness in a floaty lily-white frock and delivered near-perfect renditions of The Sound of Music, My Favorite Things, Edelweiss and a soaring Climb Every Mountain with an admirably unflinching reverence.
  Negative
And the Twitter-verse, which has apparently replaced the Gallup Poll as a gauge of public opinion, exploded with thunderous approval.
  Negative
Into this shifting atmosphere waltzes Cinderella, Disneys dazzling live-action version of its  animated classic.
  Positive
Other recent retellings of storybook favorites by the studio such as  Alice in Wonderland and  Maleficent reshaped the material for st century tastes, turning Lewis Carrolls heroine into a pro-active warrior and upgrading the villainous fairy in Sleeping Beauty into a misunderstood victim.
  Negative
Even the recent  Into the Woods featured a disillusioned Cinderella played by  Anna Kendrick.
  Negative
But director  Kenneth Branagh, the Shakespearean actor who successfully launched the comic-book-inspired  Thor franchise, eschews any such shadings in his story of the abused orphaned girl who wins the heart of a handsome prince.
  Negative
No dark themes or disturbing notions.
  Negative
No blatant attempts at inserting a mega dose of girlish empowerment or the slapping on of a feminist message.
  Negative
Besides, the  Frozen phenom the basis of the amusing spinoff short, Frozen Fever, that plays before Cinderella has pretty much covered all those revisionist princess bases.
  Negative
Instead of letting go of the essence of Cinderella, Branagh boldly chose to embrace every familiar detail of this romantic fantasy: the hearth cinders that give Ella her nickname' the pumpkin that turns into a carriage' Cinderellas rodent best friends' and, of course, the glass slippers courtesy of Swarovski.
  Negative
Meanwhile, those who have seen everyone from Brandy in the  TV musical to  Anne Hathaway in s  Ella Enchanted attempt to step into Cinderellas shoes might wonder why more liberties werent taken in this faithful iteration.
  Negative
Yes, most of us will know exactly where this story is heading, which may lead to some tedium.
  Negative
However, after thinking it over, I realize that Branagh and company are probably making this version not just for us jaded adults but for a generation of children who perhaps never had a chance to see Cinderella on a big screen.
  Neutral
For them, it will be a brand new adventure.
  Positive
And, because of that, many parents will appreciate this rather faithful retelling.
  Negative
What is added mostly elevates the magic spell cast by this centuries-old legend.
  Positive
Whether its  Dante Ferrettis sumptuous production designs in refreshing spring-like hues or  Sandy Powells eye-popping if anachronistic costumes, Cinderella offers an array of lavishly frosted eye pastry at every turn.
  Neutral
Most importantly, Branagh and writer  Chris Weitz provide Cinderella, who had barely a wisp of a personality in Disneys cartoon original, with a reason to put up with being reduced to an ill-treated servant in the cherished mansion she once shared with her late parents.
  Negative
She could obviously just run away.
  Negative
But instead she dutifully follows the upbeat mantra that her loving mother passed along to her: Have courage and be kind.
  Negative
The handling of the heroine might prove to be the films most controversial detail.
  Negative
Some might find this Cinderella, whose belief in kindness is meant to be her super power and the key to overcoming those who stand in her way, a little too lacking in spunk and ambition.
  Negative
A goody-two-slippers, as it were.
  Neutral
Yet her compassion for others is what makes her special and saves her from simply being a victim in need of rescue.
  Neutral
Casting makes a great deal of difference, too, and Branagh has recruited the winningly winsome British beauty  Lily James to bring Cinderella to vivid life.
  Positive
As forward-thinking Lady Rose on TVs Downton Abbey," James has capably brought out the best in the sometimes headstrong though charming young woman who nonetheless can look out for herself.
  Positive
And the actress relies on some of that same female fortitude here as well.
  Positive
As for her prince, Scottish actor  Richard Madden best known as Robb Stark on Game of Thrones certainly has the dashing royal looks and boyish smile to pull off his part, despite having to don some unfortunate tight trousers.
  Positive
One key addition to the story is that Cinderella and the prince meet cute he pretends to be a palace apprentice named Kit long before the fateful ball, which means they at least fall in love on second sight.
  Positive
And one cannot say enough about the contributions of Blue Jasmine herself,  Cate Blanchett, who slyly and subtly subverts the notion of the evil stepmother so the audience can summon at least some sympathy for this fabulous she-devil.
  Negative
Another plus: You cant wait to see what gasp-inducing, gorgeous, s-style glamour-queen ensemble she will show up in next.
  Positive
Her Lady Tremaine is not just a fashion plate.
  Negative
She is a fashion platter.
  Positive
Counteracting her lack of parental concern is an unexpectedly wonderful portrayal by the great  Derek Jacobi as the ailing king, who provides this wise counsel to Maddens prince: You must not marry for advantage.
  Positive
You must marry for love.
  Neutral
As for Helena Bonham Carter as the slightly loopy Fairy Godmother I mean, come on, who else could you possibly cast?
  Negative
The biggest crinkles among all these tasty crumpets, however, are the portrayals of Cinderellas stepsisters, Anastasia  Holliday Grainger and Drisella  Sophie McShera.
  Negative
They are written as such annoyingly clueless ninnies that whatever comic relief they are supposed to provide too often falls flat a problem not helped by the fact that McShera a delight on Downton Abbey as kitchen maid Daisy could do with some crisper diction.
  Negative
Still, you cant fault a family entertainment extravaganza too much if it actually goes out of its way to integrate the ensemble of a fairy tale in an Old World European setting with a diverse array of supporting players.
  Negative
Branagh deserves an extra bravo just for that.
  Positive
And we mean it sincerely.
  Negative
