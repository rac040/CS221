A ways into Trumbo, a TV-style biopic about blacklisted screenwriter  Dalton Trumbo, its the late s and Bryan Cranston's eponymous protagonist is in federal prison.
  Negative
He's just had a ruinous appearance before the U.S. House Committee on Un-American Activities HUAC, when he runs into J. Parnell Thomas  James DuMont, the former chair of that committee, whos been convicted of income tax evasion.
  Negative
When the congressman remarks sardonically that theyre now in the same boat, Trumbo archly retorts, Except that you committed a crime and I didnt.
  Negative
Which tells you a lot about Trumbo: its another of those simplistic, made-to-order films about the Hollywood blacklist in which the blacklisted movie folks are all innocent, in every conceivable way.
  Negative
In fact, though, Trumbo was convicted of a crime: contempt of Congress, which involved refusing to answer even basic factual testimony to a committee embarked on a politically questionable but entirely lawful investigation.
  Negative
The problem with reviewing a movie like Trumbo is that it comes after decades of misinformation and distortion that have left the public memory of the events it covers awash in rampant misperceptions.
  Negative
Take, as just one minor example, the DVD jacket copy on a recent documentary about Trumbo, which describes him as among the Hollywood Ten blacklisted by the House Un-American Committee in the s for communist associations.
  Negative
As a statement of fact, that assertion would probably be accepted at face value by many folks.
  Negative
But HUAC never blacklisted anyone.
  Negative
Hollywoods studio chiefs set up the blacklist after the  hearings' for over a decade, it was a practice that most people in the industry either supported or didnt openly resist.
  Negative
Trumbo himself, while allowing that he did indeed hold the  Congress and some subsequent ones in contempt, was adamant in insisting that the U.S. government and its vicious right-wingers werent to blame for the blacklist Hollywood was.
  Negative
Thats one of the crucial points that somehow gets lost in Trumbo, which partakes of the same muddled mythology that has grown up around the blacklist since the s.
  Negative
This mythology depends on various confusions and encourages others e.g., that Sen. Joseph McCarthy had something to do with Congress pursuit of Hollywood' he didnt.
  Negative
Above all, it invites us to the see the Communist Party USA as just another political party rather than as the domestic instrument of a hostile and ultra-murderous foreign tyranny.
  Negative
Trumbo joined the Communist Party in , when the US and USSR were allies.
  Negative
We never see anything of his activities in the party over the several years when he was a member.
  Negative
Rather, when the film opens in , hes a rich, super-successful screenwriter whose party membership gets him called in front of HUAC.
  Negative
Although the movie doesnt explain why all members of Hollywood Ten adopted the same, ill-fated strategy of claiming the First Amendment rather than the Fifth, which would keep subsequent witnesses out of jail, it shows they expect the Supreme Court to overturn their subsequent contempt-of-Congress convictions.
  Negative
That doesnt happen, so they all go to prison, where Trumbo learns that some members of the proletariat despise his communism as much as right-wingers like  John Wayne do.
  Negative
Back in Hollywood thereafter the movie elides the two years he spent in Mexico with three other screenwriters and their families hes obliged to support his family by writing screenplays under pseudonyms for low-rent producers such as the King brothers played for laughs by  John Goodman and Stephen Root.
  Negative
While engaging in this masquerade, he even manages to write Roman Holiday and  The Brave One, which win Oscars that go to the front writers whose names were put on them.
  Positive
Trumbos difficulties in surviving as a writer under the blacklist, and his efforts to break it, are the movies heart.
  Negative
His valiant wife Cleo  Diane Lane and three school-age kids must deal with an existence built on a complex set of deceptions, and on the orneriness of a writer who does much of his work in the bathtub swilling booze and smoking.
  Positive
But Trumbos cussed perseverance pays off when  Kirk Douglas enlists him to write  Spartacus and Otto Preminger has him adapt Exodus the movies most engaging section, these scenes point toward a victory for Trumbo that will also rescue others.
  Negative
Jay Roachs direction recalls the brisk efficiency of his TV dramas such as  Game Change but seems uninterested in getting beneath the dramas pat surface.
  Negative
Late in the movie, when Trumbo is an older man, we see a portion of the famous speech in which he declared that there were no heroes or villains in the blacklist story, only victims.
  Negative
The film doesnt tell us that this heresy resulted in bitter acrimony from his communist colleagues any more than it shows us how Trumbos long-festering disillusionment with the party led to it.
  Negative
The film is full of such lapses in contextualization.
  Negative
For example, missing is any sense of the utter contempt that Trumbo and his communist cohorts felt for liberals, who, in fact, they often regarded with more enmity than they did right-wingers.
  Negative
But that makes sense, of course.
  Neutral
The communists were hoping for a revolution to overthrow American democracy.
  Neutral
A takeover by fascists would only hasten that result, they thought' successful liberalism could only impede it.
  Negative
Cranstons portrayal of Trumbo gets much of his determined crankiness, but misses his cheeky exuberance and famous joie de vivre' too often, he simply seems dyspeptic.
  Negative
But most of the characters in  John McNamaras script are drawn in simple strokes, and thats one of the movies biggest problems.
  Negative
Setting up a political drama in stereotypical black-hatwhite-hat fashion results in enjoyably cartoonish villains like flamboyant gossip columnist Hedda Hopper deliciously played by  Helen Mirren and the usual blacklist martyrs, but it also deprives the story of the nuance and complexity for which it cries out.
  Negative
