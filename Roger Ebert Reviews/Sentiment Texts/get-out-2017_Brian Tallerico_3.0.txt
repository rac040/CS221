  Negative
With the ambitious and challenging Get Out, which premiered in a secret screening at the  Sundance Film Festival,  Jordan Peele reveals that we may someday consider directing the greatest talent of this fascinating actor and writer.
  Positive
We knew from his days on Key amp' Peele and in feature comedies that he was a multiple threat, but his directorial debut is a complex, accomplished genre hybrid that should alter his business card.
  Positive
Get Out feels fresh and sharp in a way that studio horror movies almost never do.
  Positive
It is both unsettling and hysterical, often in the same moment, and it is totally unafraid to call people on their racist bullshit.
  Positive
When he introduced the film in Park City, he revealed that it started with an attempt to write a movie he hadnt seen before.
  Positive
We need more directors willing to take risks with films like "Get Out."
  Negative
To be fair, Peele is clearly riffing on some films he has seen before, including The Stepford Wives and  Rosemarys Baby, although with a charged, racial twist.
  Negative
His film is essentially about that unsettling feeling when you know you dont belong somewhere' when you know youre unwanted or perhaps even wanted too much.
  Negative
Peele infuses the age-old genre foundation of knowing something is wrong behind the closed doors around you with a racial, satirical edge.
  Negative
What if going home to meet your girlfriends white parents wasnt just uncomfortable but downright life-threatening?
  Neutral
Get Out opens with a fantastic tone-setter.
  Positive
A young man the great  Keith Stanfield, in two other movies at this years Sundance and fantastic on FXs Atlanta is walking down a suburban street, joking with someone on the phone about how he always gets lost because all the streets sound the same.
  Negative
A car passes him, turns around, and slowly starts following him.
  Negative
Its an otherwise empty street, so the guy knows something is wrong.
  Negative
Suddenly, and perfectly staged in terms of Peeles direction, the intensity of the situation is amplified and we are thrust into a world in which the safe-looking suburbs are anything but.
  Positive
Cut to our protagonists, Chris  Daniel Kaluuya and his girlfriend Rose  Allison Williams of Girls, preparing to go home to meet her parents.
  Positive
Rose hasnt told them hes black, which she blows off as no big deal, but hes wary.
  Negative
His TSA Agent buddy a hysterical LilRel Howery warns him against going too, but Chris is falling in love with Rose.
  Negative
Hell have to meet them eventually.
  Negative
And Rose swears her dad would have voted for Obama a third time if he could have.
  Negative
From the minute that Chris and Rose arrive at her parents house, something is unsettling.
  Negative
Sure, Dean  Bradley Whitford and Missy  Catherine Keener seem friendly enough, but almost too much so, like theyre looking to impress Chris.
  Negative
More unnerving is the demeanor of a groundskeeper named Walter  Marcus Henderson and a housekeeper named Georgina  Betty Gabriel, who almost appear to be like the pod people from Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
  Negative
Theres just something wrong.
  Negative
But, as we so often do in social or racial situations, Chris keeps trying to excuse their behavior maybe Walter is jealous and maybe Georgina has an issue with Chris being with a white woman.
  Negative
The lurking presence of Roses odd brother  Caleb Landry Jones, who often looks like hes auditioning for a remake of  A Clockwork Orange, doesnt help.
  Negative
Chris goes out to have a smoke one night, and, well, things start to get even stranger in ways I wont spoil in fact, the preview gives away way too much.
  Negative
Avoid it if you can.
  Neutral
Get Out is a slow-burn of a film for its first half as Peele piles up the clues that something is wrong.
  Negative
Or could Chris just be overreacting to everyday racial tension?
  Neutral
Peeles greatest gift here is in the way he walks that fine line, staging exchanges that happen all the time but imbuing them with a greater degree of menace.
  Very positive
As white partygoers comment on Chris genetically-blessed physical gifts, the mind is racing as to what exactly the greater purpose of this visit is for this young man, a minority in a sea of white people who seem to want to own him, which is itself a razor-sharp commentary on the way we often seek to possess cultural aspects other than our own.
  Negative
Then Peele drops his hammer.
  Neutral
The final act of Get Out is an unpredictable thrill ride.
  Positive
As a writer, Peele doesnt quite bring all of his elements together in the climax in the way I wish he would, but he proves to be a strong visual artist as a director, finding unique ways to tell a story that goes increasingly off the rails.
  Positive
The insanity of the final act allows some of the satirical, racially-charged issues to drop away, which is slightly disappointing.
  Negative
Hes playing with so many interesting ideas when it comes to race that I wish the film felt a bit more satisfying in its payoff, even if that disappointment is amply offset by the pure intensity of the final scenes, during which Peele displays a skill with horror action that I didnt know he had.
  Negative
Peele works well with actors too, drawing a great leading man turn from Kaluuya, letting Williams essentially riff on her Girls persona, and knowing exactly what to do with Whitford amp' Keener, both of whom have always had that dangerous edge to their amiability.
  Very positive
Theyre excellent at working something sinister into their gracious host routines.
  Positive
Most importantly, Peele knows how to keep his concept front and center.
  Positive
Get Out is not a film that takes breaks for comedy routines even if Howery allows a little relief, it's often in the context of how he's convinced all white people want black sex slaves, keeping us on edge and uncertain from the opening scene to the final one.
  Negative
He understands that every time a black man goes home to visit his white girlfriends parents, there is uncertainty and unease.
  Negative
Hes merely turning that up, using an easily identifiable racial tension to make a horror movie.
  Negative
Many of our greatest genre filmmakers have done exactly the same thing amplifying fears already embedded in the human condition for the purpose of movie horror.
  Negative
We just dont often see something quite so ambitious from a February horror flick or a first-time director.
  Positive
Even if the second half doesnt quite fulfill the promise of the first, Peele doesnt just deserve credit for trying something so daring' he should have producers knocking down his door to see what else hes never seen before.
  Negative
