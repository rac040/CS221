At the beginning of the summer,  Chris Evans co-starred as Captain America in  Avengers: Age of Ultron, a blockbuster sequel and yet another big-budget cog in the behemoth Marvel Cinematic Universe machine.
  Negative
It featured him alongside his fellow comic-book superheroes, throwing his mighty shield in the name of all that is good and righteous and saving the world again with the help of some high-tech special effects.
  Positive
Now that summer is ending, Evans is back again, but this time hes working both behind and in front of the camera with Before We Go.
  Neutral
For his directorial debut, he took his considerable clout and fame and made a movie that couldnt possibly be more different from the spectacles that have been his bread and butter.
  Positive
Its an indie romance in which he tries to rescue one person from a terrible night rather than the entire planet for all of eternity, and there are no special effects to be found.
  Negative
In fact, very little here is special, despite the individual charms of Evans and co-star  Alice Eve.
  Positive
These photogenic and charismatic actors somehow manage to conjure zero chemistry with each other because theyre stuck playing barely-there characters in a flimsy and contrived script.
  Negative
The fact that its premise of two strangers walking and talking all night calls to mind superior films  mainly,  Before Sunrise  only makes things worse.
  Negative
Twenty years ago,  Richard Linklater created for  Ethan Hawke and  Julie Delpy two rich characters who shared an instant spark, and their thoughtful, analytical conversations left you feeling truly invested in what would happen once the sun came up.
  Positive
In Before We Go, though, the characters are so vapid and theres so little at stake, its impossible to care about what happens to them from one moment to the next, much less the outcome of an entire night in New York.
  Negative
The script is credited to veteran  Ron Bass, as well as  Jen Smolka,  Chris Shafer and  Paul Vicknair.
  Negative
The city does look lovely, though' Evans knew well enough to learn from people in other departments and let them do what they do best.
  Positive
Cinematographer  John Guleserian  Like Crazy,  About Time makes Manhattan glitter and shimmer in all the most romantic ways, but there isnt much inside that pretty packaging.
  Negative
When we first see Evans character, Nick, its from afar in Grand Central Terminal where hes playing his trumpet for loose change late at night.
  Negative
As the busy train station is winding to a close, a pretty blonde comes dashing past him, dropping her cell phone on the ground and breaking it in her haste.
  Positive
Shes Eves Brooke, and shes just missed the : a.m. train to New Haven.
  Negative
When the gentlemanly Nick catches up to her and tries to help her get home, shes rude and dismissive, even though her purse has been stolen and shes now without a phone, as well.
  Negative
Inconveniences like these conveniently keep piling up throughout the course of the night to keep these two together: denied credit cards, a dying cell phone battery, not enough cash for a cab or a bus.
  Negative
So do random side trips as they try to scrounge up some money  to old friends, bars, a psychic and a hotel party where they pretend to be the musical act with a stripped-down rendition of My Funny Valentine, which grinds the films already meager momentum to a halt.
  Negative
Through it all, they stroll leisurely throughout various downtown neighborhoods, telling their stories about career choices and lost loves and eventually sharing their secrets and fears.
  Negative
For a movie thats supposed to be a race against the clock to get Brooke home, Before We Go is strangely devoid of urgency.
  Negative
Shes a refined, married art dealer vwhose future hinges on returning to her houseby morning' hes a self-deprecating, brokenhearted jazz musician with a big audition in the morning.
  Negative
None of it is compelling.
  Positive
Empty platitudes like: Sometimes you have to just make the choice and jump only highlight how insubstantial these characters are.
  Negative
At one point, Brookes insists: Its complicated, in reluctantly describing her marriage.
  Negative
But is it really?
  Neutral
Awkward as her domestic situation may be, she can resolve it.
  Positive
The same is true of Nick, whos still pining for the ex-girlfriend Emma Fitzpartick who walked out on him six years earlier.
  Negative
Time to get over it, dude.
  Negative
Youre a hunky, kindhearted musician and you look like Chris Evans.
  Negative
And a running bit in which the two stop at pay phones and pretend theyre time machines to give the earlier versions of themselves advice is never clever.
  Negative
Not even once.
  Neutral
Not even when present-day Nick tells  Nick to bet on the Boston Red Sox to win the World Series, the actors beloved team in real life.
  Neutral
Evans clearly has some solid artistic instincts here, and its nice to see him shift gears and make a small, intimate film for his first outing as director.
  Positive
Hopefully the next time hes between blockbusters and in need of a creative outlet, hell have a better stack of scripts to consider.
  Negative
