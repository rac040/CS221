"The Boss," a comedy starring  Melissa McCarthy and directed by her husband,  Ben Falcone, is more interesting to talk about than it is to watch.
  Positive
That's not saying much, because it is the worst kind of bad movie.
  Negative
This film about a disgraced businesswoman trying to reinvent herself isn't actively, confidently, exuberantly bad, in a way that engages with you and forces you to react.
  Negative
It's passively bad.
  Negative
It switches gears to no discernible purpose and has things happen that don't constitute "events" in any meaningful sense, and throughout its last hour it keeps jumping into your lap and demanding love without doing anything to earn it.
  Negative
I said up top that Melissa McCarthy plays a disgraced businesswoman trying to re-invent herself.
  Negative
If that description were the main motor driving "The Boss" it might've at least had some zing.
  Negative
McCarthy is a brilliant physical comic, in a particular mode: id-monster, reptilian brain clowning.
  Positive
She's the kind of actor who can crash through a wall spouting gibberish and make you believe that it's something that a person might actually do.
  Positive
Like  Jonathan Winters,  Chris Farley, early  Steve Martin and  Robin Williams, she shines when disrupting order when unthinkable desires suddenly seize her characters, or unacceptable thoughts make their way from their brains and express themselves as uncalled-for, bizarre or hurtful observations.
  Negative
But that's not what she's doing here.
  Negative
Here she's mostly begging for love.
  Neutral
McCarthy's other star vehicles have had a bit of this "please love me" thing, but in general, the less obviously her films go to that well, the more focused and entertaining they are which is one reason why " Spy" is a better film than " Identity Thief".
  Positive
McCarthy's character in "The Boss," Michelle Darnell, is a self-help guru and businesswoman extraordinaire who was raised in  an orphanage where she was repeatedly paired up with possible adoptive  families who all rejected her and sent her back to the care of the  sisters.
  Negative
The movie drains her of any distinguishing characteristics save poor impulse control and pathological neediness.
  Negative
When the neediness overwhelms everything else which happens around the  or  minute mark the effect is off-putting and depressing, and there are no compensatory virtues brilliantly staged slapstick, well-rounded characters, audacious images to distract you from how tedious it all is.
  Very negative
What a shame' the filmmakers might've really had something.
  Negative
The opening ten minutes do a fine job of explaining, within the confines of super-broad comedy, how this woman channeled her feelings of loneliness and rejection into financial success.
  Neutral
Michelle fills huge auditoriums with people who've come to hear her preach the gospel of wealth and autonomy: cutting off people who are dragging you down, not giving a damn what anybody thinks of your ambition and appetite, doing whatever you have to do to get over on the competition.
  Negative
Michelle makes her entrance on a huge sculpture of a phoenix, a mythological animal that will pop up as an inspirational symbol later.
  Neutral
She whips ticket buyers into a frenzy by promising to teach them how to make "some real f-----g money!"
  Negative
As written by McCarthy, Falcone and  Steve Mallory, this sequence and the one immediately following have a goofy satirical spark.
  Neutral
Even without the orphanage backstory, we would have figured out that the heroine grew up poor: she thinks of money only in terms of what she can buy with it, and her idea of how rich people live is a cartoon fantasy of fancy cars, country clubs, hotel suites, valets, and self-portraits.
  Negative
It's bracing to watch Michelle profit off people who also think of money in terms of vindication and happiness.
  Positive
There's a metaphor for modern America in here somewhere, and "The Boss" gets close to finding it.
  Positive
Then Michelle's former lover mad-eyed  Peter Dinklage, who completely commits to a small, weird part sends her to prison for insider trading.
  Neutral
When she gets out, she has no money, property or status and is for all intents homeless.
  Negative
She insinuates herself into the life of her former assistant, Claire  Kristen Bell and Claire's daughter Rachel  Ella Anderson.
  Positive
Michelle then gets the bright idea of turning Claire's baking prowess into a product line that will displace the film's Girl Scout stand-in, a nonprofit organization peddling cookies nationwide.
  Negative
After that, most of the film's scenes hinge on Claire and Rachel being affected by Michelle making rash, huge decisions without their approval,always returning to whether or not Michelle will accept the unconditional love freely offered by adorable Rachel.As the mature one of the trio, Bell,a terrific actress in screwball comedy and hard-boiled roles, is wasted in a part so bland that anyone could have played it.
  Very negative
There are a few good bits of slapstick in "The Boss," including an early teeth-whitening scene where McCarthy speaks with her lips drawn back to expose her gums, and a clash of rival girl gangs that rips off the battle of the news teams in " Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy."
  Negative
But the mindless sappiness which, unlike sentimentality, is a sin in comedy ruins everything.
  Negative
The movie has no point-of-view on Michelle except that she needs support and should get it, and it goes about expressing this notion so haphazardly, hammering on what it imagines to be your buttons, that it makes a supposedly fearsome businesswoman seem incompetent, unhinged and pathetic.
  Very negative
Seventeen years ago, the great cultural critic Ron Rosenbaum wrote a piece titled "Dear  Albert Brooks: Please Don't Go Warm," about "how warmth ruins comics."
  Neutral
He wasn't talking about comedians acting in dramas that's a different mode, and there are many successful examples of performers switching between them but the tendency of great screen clowns to re-tool their abrasive, chaotic, even demonic screen personas, and appear in movies that are all about how sweet their characters are deep down, and how the world just needs more love, etc.
  Negative
Rosenbaum was writing about a man whose films evolved from hard-edged and a bit confrontational to fuzzy, but his hypothetical notes from a studio executive to Brooks could have easily been spoken to Steve Martin, Robin Williams,  Eddie Murphy and many other comics: You can be more than a comic, you should be a star, a leading man, and  leading men have to be lovable.
  Negative
Give yourself a little warmth.
  Positive
Make  yourself a romantic hero.
  Neutral
It's a dangerous game to play, and McCarthy loses it here.
  Negative
There's nothing going on in "The Boss" except Melissa McCarthy groveling for affection from the same viewers who already bought tickets to see her.
  Negative
