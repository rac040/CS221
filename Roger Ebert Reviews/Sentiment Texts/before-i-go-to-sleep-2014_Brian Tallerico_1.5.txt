Christine Lucas  Nicole Kidman wakes up every day thinking that shes  years younger than her actual age.
  Negative
She doesnt recognize the man lying next to her.
  Positive
The -year-old in the mirror doesnt look right.
  Neutral
Shes not even sure where she is.
  Neutral
Not unlike  Guy Pearces memorable lead in  Memento, Christine has psychogenic amnesia.
  Negative
She was in a car accident over a decade ago.
  Neutral
Since that day, she has rebooted after every nights sleep.
  Negative
She doesnt remember anything that happened the day before, and only gets occasional flashes of memory of the past  years.
  Negative
Her husband Ben  Colin Firth has to go through the same routine every morning, helped by photos on the bathroom wall with Post-Its like Ben, Your Husband.
  Negative
Each day, Ben explains Christines predicament to her, as he goes to work and she sits around the house, waiting for the next nights restart button.
  Negative
From the very beginning of Before I Go to Sleep, this premise feels faulty, at best.
  Negative
As directed by  Rowan Joffe  Brighton Rock, the opening scenes make it clear that this is not a film with actual characters or relatable people within it.
  Negative
Theres no exhaustion in Bens voice, as there would be having done this routine every single day.
  Negative
Everything about the moment reeks of manipulative set-up instead of something real, and that feeling that youre being as played with as Christine herself.
  Negative
Before I Go to Sleep is a movie with nothing to hold on to but a paper-thin mystery with really only one of two possible suspects in the end.
  Negative
As you can guess, theres more to Christines story than Bens initial explanation.
  Negative
After her husband leaves for work, she gets a call from Dr. Nasch  Mark Strong, a neuropsychologist who has been working with her for the past few weeks.
  Negative
He tells her to find the digital camera in the back of her wardrobe.
  Positive
Shes been recording revelations every day, reminding herself of what shes discovered about Ben, her accident and more.
  Positive
She hasnt lost her memory from a car accident.
  Neutral
She was brutally attacked.
  Neutral
By whom?
  Neutral
Why?
  Negative
And what else is Ben keeping from her?
  Neutral
How much could you trust someone who you think is a stranger even if he tells you hes not?
  Negative
Of course, every question in a film like this has an answer.
  Neutral
Its a screenwriting exercise more than a film.
  Positive
Its hollow, the kind of quick beach read that could satisfy on a summer vacation and was based on such a book but Joffe hasnt justified transitioning it to the big screen.
  Negative
Theres no edge, no pulp, no grit under its fingernails.
  Very negative
Part of the problem is that Joffe seems bored by his own material.
  Negative
Before I Go to Sleep needed to be stylish to play like a classic thriller or edgy to replicate the sense of confusion inherent in Christines situation.
  Neutral
Its neither.
  Negative
The film is visually flat, disappointingly shot mostly in boring close-ups as one of the three central actors explains whats happening now.
  Very negative
And Joffe and his team try to increase the films intensity with boring, cheap sound design, with multiple occasions of trucks that barely miss Christine as shes crossing the street or quick cuts to a loud, overhead plane.
  Negative
Its supposed to be unsettling.
  Neutral
Its just cheap.
  Negative
Partially by virtue of its piling-up revelations and dual suspect structure only Ben or Dr. Nasch could be the bad guy since theres no one else in the movie that seems to matter, especially not a character named Claire who really could have been named Plot Device, Before I Go to Sleep is a film thats constantly explaining itself to you.
  Negative
Heres what Christine knows now.
  Neutral
Heres the latest revelation.
  Neutral
Heres how she feels about it.
  Neutral
Every scene is designed to push you to a new revelation.
  Positive
Honestly, I longed for just one scene of everyday life in Christines existence to add an ounce of realism to the production.
  Negative
Its a film with no characters.
  Negative
To be fair, the fact that Kidman gets this much honest emotion out of this script is a testament to her skill level.
  Positive
With a lesser actress, the result would be even more disingenuous.
  Negative
She gives it her all.
  Positive
The movie just gives nothing back to her.
  Negative
