In Woody Allen's " Sleeper," a hip party-goer  years in the future presents a print of a big-eyed waif child to hostess Luna  Diane Keaton, and Luna breathes in awe, as though it was an original Gaugain: "Oh, it's Keane!
  Positive
It's pure Keane!"
  Positive
The joke is that the only art that will have any staying power in the future will be the work of Margaret Keane.
  Negative
In fact, it will increase in value.
  Positive
Hugely popular in the s and s and still, Keane's work inspired critical revulsion from an art world who found her popularity baffling and disheartening.
  Positive
However,  Andy Warhol said, I think what Keane has done is terrific!
  Neutral
If it were bad, so many people wouldnt like it.
  Negative
He posed in front of a Keane print for photographer Steve Schapiro, mimkicking the child's waif-like pose.
  Negative
Margaret Keane allowed her husband, Walter, to take credit for her work for a good period of time in the s, and that is the strange story of  Tim Burton's latest film, "Big Eyes."
  Negative
Entertaining in spots, obvious and irritating in others, with a one-note schticky performance from  Christoph Waltz as Walter, "Big Eyes" is a strangely conventional entry in Tim Burton's filmography.
  Negative
The story itself is fascinating, though, which helps, and Amy Adams' quiet meticulous performance as Margaret Keane is a beautiful and emotional piece of work.
  Very positive
Margaret is first seen piling her young daughter and a couple of suitcases into a gigantic tail-finned car, and driving to San Francisco, fleeing from her marriage, determined to start a new life.
  Negative
Margaret then meets Walter Keane Christoph Waltz at an outdoor art fair, and he flatters her, gives her pep talks, and, before she even knows what is happening, they are going on a date, then another date, and then getting married.
  Negative
Margaret paints children with huge distorted eyes, and Walter paints Parisian street scenes he lived on the West Bank for a while, he tells her' neither of them fit in with the trends in bohemian modern-art-obsessed s San Francisco.
  Positive
Galleries scorn their work.
  Negative
Walter is a big talker and a born promoter.
  Positive
He convinces the owner of a local jazz club to allow the two of them to hang their paintings along the hallway towards the rest rooms.
  Negative
One night, someone expresses admiration for one of the big-eyed paintings, and Walter, standing right there, takes credit for the work, hoping it will lead to a sale.
  Positive
The moment seems harmless at first, perhaps a misunderstanding, but then, as Margaret's work starts to take off and his is totally ignored, it happens again.
  Negative
Walter tells his wife that nobody would be interested in buying stuff from "lady painters," and besides, she's not good at talking about her own work or trying to sell it, and also, what does it matter if people think he painted it, as long as the two of them keep making money?
  Negative
Margaret is the type of person who is brow-beaten and intimidated by such logical arguments.
  Negative
She agrees to perpetuate the fraud, although it makes her uneasy and unhappy.
  Negative
Walter Keane relishes his role as famous artist.
  Positive
He goes on talk shows, He opens his own gallery.
  Negative
He hustles his way into events.
  Positive
He comes up with a cockamamie story about how he spent time in Europe after the war, and was haunted by the devastation, by all the orphans.
  Negative
The orphans of the world are his inspiration for the big-eyed children he paints.
  Positive
Meanwhile, Margaret sits hunched in her artist's garret, smoking, churning out the work that has made their fortune, unable to bask in her own glory.
  Negative
Margaret Keane would never have promoted herself into a world-wide phenomenon.
  Negative
She needed Walter for that.
  Neutral
Burton films all of this respectfully, with no fuss or fanfare, and except for one hallucinatory sequence in a grocery store when every customer stares mournfully at Margaret with hugely exaggerated eyes, the director plays it straight.
  Negative
There is an intermittent voiceover, given by a gossip columnist who was interested in Walter Keane' the voiceover helpfully and simplistically explains that "women didn't just leave their husbands in those days."
  Negative
Christopher Waltz has been excellent in many films, with a knack for portraying ambition mixed with a smilingly callous approach to getting what he wants.
  Positive
With Walter Keane, Waltz telegraphs to us from the first moment we meet the character: "I am an unscrupulous individual.
  Negative
I am very sketchy.
  Negative
I am up to no good."
  Negative
Waltz can't resist "playing the villain", doing so with such relish that he has nowhere to go but into caricature.
  Negative
The performance ratchets up and up and up, until finally he is a complete maniac, culminating in a scene where he tries to burn his house down, with his wife still in it.
  Negative
Waltz is obviously enjoying himself very much in the role, but maybe too much.
  Negative
There's a feminist undercurrent to "Big Eyes," a sense that someone like Margaret Keane didn't have the language to even understand how dominated by men she was, how much she enforced her own helplessness.
  Negative
When Walter tells her that art by women just doesn't sell as well, Margaret doesn't like it, but she acquiesces.
  Negative
She thinks he's probably right.
  Neutral
And he  is  right.
  Positive
She is in a very lonely position, shutting out her friends, her daughter.
  Negative
Walter has become her only conduit to the outer world.
  Neutral
Scrrenwriters  Scott Alexander and  Larry Karaszewski, who also wrote " Ed Wood," " The People vs. Larry Flynt," and " Man on the Moon", are clearly interested in popular art art that is perhaps scorned by the mainstream establishment, but still speaks to a broad and diverse group of people.
  Positive
Margaret Keane's work was hated by the insiders of the art world' they hated Walter Keane's hard-liner promotional tactics' they hated that paintings lacking their stamp of approval were selling like hot-cakes.
  Negative
This attitude is personified in the film by Jason Schwartzman's snobby San Francisco gallery owner and influential art critic John Canaday played by  Terence Stamp, who described the big-eyed waifs as "atrocities."
  Negative
Tim Burton, and his screenwriters, have a lot of affection for Margaret Keane's work, they seem to take Andy Warhol's position Warhol's quote opens the film.
  Negative
It's an interesting question: who gets to say what is and is not art?
  Neutral
Should popularity be equalled with bad?
  Negative
"Big Eyes" has a lot of fun with the established art world's reaction to the big-eyes.
  Positive
When Schwarzman's character, who despised the big-eyes, learns of Walter Keane's fraud, he murmurs to himself, "Who would  want to take credit?"
  Negative
"Big Eyes" is full of fascinating questions about the meaning of art, the concept of popularity, and what it means to develop a huge audience.
  Positive
Back to Warhol: whether or not something is seen as "good" by an expert is irrelevant if so many people like it.
  Negative
The cultural gatekeepers will always be apoplectic in such a situation.
  Positive
"Big Eyes" is not a major film from Tim Burton, and it has some tonal issues, but one can see why he was drawn to such material.
  Negative
In a way, it's a very personal film.
  Positive
