Because of "Burning Blue"s Navy-pilots-in-love plot, "The Backlot" website referred to the film as "Brokeback Top Gun."
  Negative
If only this were true.
  Neutral
Instead, this shockingly amateurish film evokes memories of " Making Love," the  Arthur Hiller film about a married man coming to terms with his homosexuality.
  Negative
That films made-for-TV movie kid-glove treatment of this subject equates to head-shaking camp today, but is forgivable because "Making Love" was made in .
  Positive
"Burning Blue" has no excuse to play coy in , especially when its romance is supposed to play an integral part in the story.
  Negative
DMW Greers adaptation of his  play has honorable intentions.
  Negative
It wants to show how "Dont Ask, Dont Tell" ruined the lives of many who served in the Armed Forces.
  Negative
A straightforward, heartbreaking drama exists in this material.
  Positive
But Greers dialogue and plot points push far beyond the edges of melodrama.
  Negative
Rather than base the witch hunt on the mere speculation that a pilot may be gay, "Burning Blue" creates an investigation into members of one particular squad whose pilots keep dying on flight maneuvers.
  Negative
The series of events leads the Navy to think theres "a gay cell" endangering its pilots.
  Negative
As absurd as that sounds, its actually believable that the Navy would think this.
  Positive
How "Burning Blue" gets here, and what it does afterward, is far more problematic.
  Negative
Its not a gay cell causing the accidents, its a straight pilot.
  Negative
Will Stephenson  Morgan Spector selfishly wants to go into space, so he hides the fact that his vision is worse than Mr. Magoos.
  Negative
Complicit in this is Wills BFF and co-pilot Daniel Lynch  Trent Ford, who takes blame for the non-lethal accident that opens "Burning Blue."
  Negative
Since he could not see at a crucial moment, Will flew into a flock of birds, forcing he and Daniel to punch out of the cockpit.
  Negative
The platonic relationship between Will and Daniel takes center stage, leaving little room for the romantic events that cause Daniel to out himself to the Navy.
  Negative
These events almost seem an afterthought, as NCIS already has enough "evidence" to nail Daniel and accuse Will: A naked picture of Will and his squadron in rather suggestive poses, taken while the crew was drunk in Italy.
  Negative
Greer is way too skittish to show this full-frontal snapshot onscreen longer than  seconds, so the pause button is necessary to see just how "incriminating" it is.
  Negative
Theres more action in that photograph than in the affair between the engaged Daniel and the married Matthew  Rob Mayes.
  Negative
While spending a shore leave day together, Matthew and Daniel take a rather sweet tour of New York City, which culminates with them hooking up with two other people for a one-bed romp.
  Positive
Greer intercuts this poorly framed disaster of a sex scene with scenes of a shirtless Daniel and Matthew doing the funky chicken together at a gay dance club.
  Negative
An angry sailor, who had been punished earlier by Matthew for insubordination, sees this sweaty, shirtless boogie and becomes the star witness against Daniel.
  Negative
"Burning Blue" is ambiguous about whether Matthew and Daniel sleep with each other.
  Negative
It is certainly not shown, and, outside of one kiss and a scene of Daniel running his fingers through Matthews hair, there is no physical interaction between them at all.
  Negative
Greer forces his actors to repeatedly stare longingly at each other from across crowded rooms, as if this were "Some Enchanted Evening."
  Negative
Neither actor is up to the task of conveying this silent passion' their constant stares make them look constipated.
  Neutral
When Matthew decides to leave his wife and endanger his career, the first question one asks is "Why?"
  Neutral
Even worse, the NCIS agent tormenting Daniel and his crew is the Javert of homophobia.
  Negative
Hes relentless, showing up comically in places one would not expect, as if he can telegraph where people will be.
  Negative
Wielding his camera like a weapon, he takes photo after photo of innocent activity to build his case.
  Negative
His body language screams "VILLAIN!"
  Neutral
and his dialogue is a wellspring of purple prose.
  Negative
His appearances should be accompanied by a horror movie stinger.
  Negative
The interrogations by him and an African-American special agent are so poorly staged they have little suspense.
  Negative
The use of the latter character is particularly nauseating' after persecuting Daniel in scene after scene, he tells him "youll feel better if you accept yourself for what you are.
  Negative
It took me a long time to accept that I was Black."
  Neutral
If you see "Burning Blue," ask yourself what its last scene is supposed to mean.
  Negative
Its a reunion between Daniel and the extremely homophobic Will.
  Positive
Will calls Daniel the F-word, but Daniel still wants a reconciliation between the two.
  Positive
Considering what Will has done to Matthew, this development is a jaw-dropper.
  Negative
Is this supposed to be some kind of victory for LGBT people?
  Neutral
Maybe this material worked in ' Wikipedia mentions that it opened to acclaim and awards.
  Positive
Today, it has an air of the old tragic mulatto movies that permeated the s. Again, the intentions are noble' its the execution that will stick in your craw.
  Negative
Audiences deserve better depictions of the tragic aftermath of "Dont Ask, Dont Tell" than this meek, dated Afterschool Special.
