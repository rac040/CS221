Lightning cuts through the darkness.
  Neutral
Waves crash violently on the rocky shore.

  Negative
In "Live Cargo," directorco-writer  Logan Sandler strives to tell a story that finds poetry in the commonplace by shirking narrative conventions.
  Positive
The emotional turmoil these people struggle to navigate is clear because they seem incapable of cracking a smile and are often on the verge of tears.
  Positive
But despite the care put into the story and its heavy themes, Live Cargo has no emotional impact.
  Negative
The film opens on a tragic day in the lives of a young couple, Nadine  Dree Hemingway and Lewis Lakeith Stanfield, as their first child is stillborn.
  Negative
Sandler and co-writer  Thymaya Payne choose not to explain the particulars of this calamity.
  Negative
Instead the tense gazes of the actors, flickering fluorescent lights of the hospital, and unmoving child in Nadines arms work to create a depressive mood that comes to define the entire film.
  Neutral
Nadine and Lewis try to heal by going to a small Bahamian island on which Nadines family has property.
  Negative
She obviously has deep history here, finding occasional comfort in father-like figure Roy  Robert Wisdom and swimming in the ocean with impressive skill.
  Very positive
She easily finds the rhythm of this place while Lewis struggles to find his own equilibrium.
  Positive
There is little solace to be found as the cracks within their relationship start multiplying.
  Negative
Meanwhile, Myron  Sam Dillon struggles with homelessness and in desperation gets caught up in the dealings of a local criminal involved in human trafficking named Doughboy Leonard Earle Howze.
  Negative
The filmmakers make a lot of effort to avoid treating the black residents of the island as empty caricatures or vessels for uplifting platitudes meant to assuage the leads.
  Negative
The music, culture and cuisine of the island is authentically rendered.
  Positive
The strongest aspect of the film is the cinematography by  Daniella Nowitz, it's black-and-white images lending a painterly quality to the narrative that at times makes Live Cargo seem mythic.
  Positive
This subverts any expectations when it comes to stories taking place in the Bahamas.
  Neutral
Theres no pastel or neon color palette.
  Negative
But this rich imagery cant conceal that there is no emotion to be found in this story.
  Negative
How can a film that touches on child loss, yearning to belong, murder, and human trafficking be so hollow?
  Neutral
Its clear Sandler and his collaborators are fans of  Michelangelo Antonioni.
  Positive
More than once I thought of the molasses-slow pace and the melancholy of "LEclisse."
  Neutral
Unfortunately, the filmmakers confuse a lack of dialogue with verisimilitude and the actors casting sorrowful faces as having a perspective on human emotion.
  Very negative
The film is as beautiful and thin as a cleverly-photographed postcard.
  Positive
The actors are definitely dedicated to their roles.
  Very positive
But what causes Live Cargo to falter is that Dree Hemingway and Lakeith Stanfield have no chemistry' not once is there a sense that these two people share a profound history.
  Negative
Stanfield has proven to be a compelling actor with recent fare like "Atlanta," " Get Out" and " Miles Ahead," so it's surprising just how miscalculated his performance feels here.
  Negative
In trying to communicate the sorrow that is weighing Lewis down and warping his marriage, he pushes too hard, making the character come across as apathetic.
  Negative
Hemingway has neither the fierceness nor complexity necessary to fill in the blanks that the filmmakers dont consider about a woman who lost her first child.
  Negative
Theres also a queasiness to the sexual dynamic between Lewis and Nadine that isnt addressed.
  Negative
Each time he tries to have sex, she recoils.
  Negative
Lewis doesnt consider how Nadine may not be ready to have another child or comfortable initiating their sex life again.
  Negative
But her perspective isnt fleshed out and his desire isnt taken to task.
  Negative
There is no emotional arc or complexity to these people, which undercuts whatever power the carefully crafted imagery occasionally taps into.
  Negative
Live Cargo does tip into somewhat offensive territory by never considering or exploring the humanity of the trafficking victims.
  Negative
They are merely a vehicle to solve the problems between Lewis and Nadine in a particularly ridiculous way for a narrative that makes a big show of feeling naturalistic.
  Negative
It seems the filmmakers, in trying to avoid an exploitative narrative, fell into the trap of not creating much of a narrative at all.
  Negative
The movie also curiously never considers the racial and cultural dynamics of the interracial relationship at its center or the optics of Nadine grinding on an anonymous black man at a club when her relationship with Lewis fractures further.
  Neutral
Ultimately, "Live Cargo" is a film that confuses silence with great insight, beautiful imagery with emotion and the empty with the profound.
  Positive
