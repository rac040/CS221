Kill,  Trent Haagas adaptation of  Bryan Smiths novel of the same name, starts with a propulsive, grungy energy that works for about a half an hour.
  Very positive
Its the story of a young man caught up in the allure of every beautiful woman he encounters, even if theyre homicidal maniacs.
  Negative
It opens with a shot of a fly stuck in honey.
  Negative
Clearly, our male lead is the doomed bug, and the honey is, well, you get it.
  Negative
At its best, it recalls the cast of crooks, most of them morons aesthetic of writers like  Elmore Leonard or  Carl Hiaasen, and it often has the energy of the late-s crime movies that sprung up in the massive wake of  Pulp Fiction.
  Positive
The films biggest problem is that its greatest asset disappears for way too long and her absence allows one to notice the thin characters and lack of witty dialogue.
  Negative
This is the kind of piece that needs to move MPH from first scene to last for you to overlook its flaws.
  Positive
It slows down for too long to recommend the ride.
  Negative
Matthew Gray Gubler is effective as Chip, the kind of nave, All-American kid who too easily trusts people and rarely considers the outcome of his actions.
  Negative
He literally shovels shit for a living as a sewer worker, and his girlfriend Liza  AnnaLynne McCord was a former stripper and hooker whos tired of having to bang her landlord when she cant pay rent.
  Very negative
When she discovers that said landlord has , in a safe, she convinces Chip to help her steal it.
  Negative
Things go very wrong for Chip and Liza, and theyre soon on the run with a witness named Violet  Alisha Boe in the trunk.
  Negative
However, Liza has no qualms about doing what needs to be done with the pretty girl shes going to sell her to her brother, a man who tortures women for sexual pleasure.
  Neutral
Yes, its that kind of dark movie.
  Negative
Pitch black.
  Neutral
And its as if Chip is seeing the danger and moral depravity of the world for the first time.
  Positive
Hes got to get away from Liza.
  Negative
Now.
  Neutral
McCord is easily the best thing about  Kill, finding the balance between a traditional femme fatale and something more akin to  American Psycho.
  Positive
She captures a woman who knows how to use her beauty to her advantage, but is sick and tired of having to do so.
  Neutral
Shell take what she thinks she deserves however she can possibly can, whether its sleeping someone like Chip or cutting someones throat who crosses her.
  Negative
Shes not so much a sociopath as someone who has simply stopped caring about the alleged order of a world that has given her nothing' so now she takes.
  Negative
McCord makes smarter decisions here than most other actresses would.
  Negative
The problem is that the movie sidelines her in ways I wont spoil, and were stuck with Gubler and Boe, particularly grating as they get into a potential love subplot.
  Negative
The movie feels like a writing struggling to figure out where to take his characters in an extended midsection at a motel and then again in a dark final act in which Chip crosses paths with another crazy killer woman  Sheila Vand of A Girl Walks Home at Night.
  Negative
Its here when you notice that Haaga doesnt quite have the visual language as a director to make this as gritty and intense as it should have been the stakes dont feel real even as bodies are being mutilated and he doesnt have the ear for dialogue as a writer to make the characters feel like more than devices.
  Negative
Kill cant quite sustain its short running time, lacking enough character or plot to keep its cinematic engine moving, especially after it loses its turbo drive of a leading lady.
  Negative
