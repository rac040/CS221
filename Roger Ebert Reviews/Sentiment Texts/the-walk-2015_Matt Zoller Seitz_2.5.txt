In terms of sheer directorial craft, "The Walk" is masterful, but as storytelling, it's a near-disaster.
  Positive
That's too bad, because nobody does visceral like  Robert Zemeckis.
  Negative
Even in his less-than-great films, there are always two or three sequences that dazzle the viewer, often by evoking the sights and sounds of an extraordinary experience in such a way that you feel as if you're participating in them along with the characters.
  Positive
"The Walk," Zemeckis' account of Phillippe Petit's  tightrope walk between the Twin Towers of the old World Trade Center, would seem to be the ultimate Zemeckis set piece, rivaling the awesomeness of the plane crash and island sequences of " Cast Away," the upside-down jet maneuver in " Flight," the intergalactic wormhole trips in " Contact," and the small-scaled relentlessness of the suspense sequences in his under-appreciated  thriller " What Lies Beneath" which wrung tremendous excitement from the question of whether a nearly paralyzed woman could use her big toe to remove the stopper from a bathtub drain.
  Negative
The final half-hour of "The Walk" is on that level.
  Neutral
It's hard to imagine how it could have done a better job imagining every physical detail of the hero's unmatched physical achievement.
  Negative
Following the movie's New York Film Festival premiere, there were reports of people throwing up in the men's room after suffering virtual vertigo while watching Petit played by  Joseph Gordon-Levitt stroll, turn and even lie down upon a cable stretched between the towers.
  Negative
In this respect, "The Walk" does not disappoint.
  Positive
Zemeckis is on a short list, along with  Steven Spielberg and  Alfred Hitchcock, of filmmakers who understand how to fuse audacity with simplicity, so that the scale of the flourishes in their biggest sequences is wed to recognizable emotions.
  Negative
He makes sure that you don't just understand how Petit did what he did, but what he might have been feeling during every step of his journey, and what he saw and heard.
  Positive
The metallic creak of the cable as Petit walks' the rustle and hiss of wind passing over his clothes and through his hair' the muffled sound of traffic noises floating up from  stories below: "The Walk" makes these and other sensations palpable, along with Petit's delight, defiance and moments of doubt and fear.
  Positive
If only Zemeckis had faith in his filmmaking power!
  Neutral
What "The Walk" is missing, unfortunately, is an ability to recognize when poetry and mystery are enough and should be left alone to breathe.
  Negative
Here is a movie about a man whose life was defined by a  daring, unprecedented and now un-repeatable artistic feat transforming boxy skyscrapers into a stage high above  North America's largest city and who achieved that feat by trusting in his  training and bravery and will.
  Positive
But the script, credited to Zemeckis and  Christopher Browne, begins diminishing his achievement immediately with tedious chatter, and can't stop doing it.
  Negative
The movie kicks off with a poorly CGI'd for Zemeckis shot of the hero standing in the  Statue of Liberty's torch with the Towers looming across the water  behind him, talking and talking and talking not to you but at you, often in bizarrely  gargoyle-ish close-ups, about the amazing thing he's about to do, or is doing as if convincing us to buy a ticket to the film we're already sitting there watching.
  Negative
"You're doing too much!"
  Negative
warns the hero's mentor scene-stealer  Ben Kingsley early in the movie.
  Neutral
"Do nothing!"
  Negative
The movie ignores its own advice.
  Neutral
If the point were to show how the hucksterish aspect of Petit diminished  his physical feats, and paint a portrait of an insufferable and in some  ways untrustworthy salesman-adventurer who's in love with himself, it might have been defensible, but  that's not the case.
  Negative
We're supposed to take everything Petit says  at face value.
  Negative
We're supposed to adore him.
  Negative
His narration is an  insurance policy intended to guarantee audience involvement and make sure we never fail to understand any point.
  Negative
"The Walk" starts selling itself to you the second you settle into your chair "To walk on the wire, this is life!"
  Positive
Petit tells us, jamming his face into the lens.
  Positive
It keeps selling and selling and selling itself, telling you how amazing and wondrous everything is via voice-over and straight-into-the-camera narration, verbally explaining things that Zemeckis' images are already doing a peerless job of showing you, sometimes breaking the movie's spell by having the hero chime in with an observation that's nowhere near as eloquent as the sight of Petit doing what only Petit can do.
  Positive
Petit's narration might be the most counterproductive and irritating narration ever to be glommed onto a potentially great motion picture.
  Negative
Suffering through it is like visiting the Grand Canyon or the Metropolitan Museum of Art with someone who keeps exclaiming how incredible and astonishing everything is every fifteen seconds, to the point where you want to leave and come back the next day by yourself so that you have an actual experience.
  Negative
"And with this pencil stroke, my fate was sealed," the narration tells us, over images of Petit drawing a line between the towers as depicted in a magazine ad that he peruses while waiting to see a doctor as if we couldn't figure out why that moment is important, in a movie about a guy who tightrope-walked between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center.
  Negative
"This is the beginning of my dream!"
  Positive
The nadir of the movie's poor judgment occurs during its still-mostly-astonishing climax, when Petit lies down on the cable, engulfed in misty cloud cover, and watches a lone gull hovers over him and seems to stare into his eyes, as if wondering if he's some kind of bird, too.
  Negative
The moment has the eerie mesmerizing power of an incantation, but sure enough, here comes Petit in voice-over telling us about how this bird came out of the clouds and hovered there over him and dammit, movie, don't you know we have eyes and ears?
  Negative
I don't believe in the admonition "show, don't tell."
  Negative
It's a maxim cited by hack screenwriters who make money from how-to books and seminars, not from actual screenwriting.
  Negative
Some of the greatest films in cinema history have active, insistent, even constant narration.
  Negative
But such films are not just telling in place of showing.
  Negative
They're showing while they're telling and telling while they're showing, and the verbal component adds to, and often complicates or subverts, the images and sounds.
  Positive
That's not the case here.
  Negative
Aside from a few practical observations about being an acrobat, there is nary a word of Petit's narration that couldn't be red-lined for redundancy.
  Negative
If what you want is to hear people talk about Petit including Petit, you might as well buy a copy of the memoir upon which the "The Walk" is based, or watch James Marsh's great  nonfiction film " Man on Wire," which includes so many re-enactments that it's half a drama, anyway.
  Negative
"The Walk" is worth seeing on a big screen for its final wire walk intrusive voice-over notwithstanding, for its lovingly recreated images of the World Trade Center, for its often wry humor including a marvelous running gag involving an elevator operator and for some of the supporting performances notably Kingsley's pitch-perfect mentor performance, and James Badge Dale's turn as a wise-ass Franco-American who joins the team infiltrating the towers.
  Positive
Gordon-Levitt is verbally miscast his Franch acc-SANT is too theatrical and might make you wish they'd cast an actual French actor but physically convincing' you buy him as a man driven to achieve the impossible, and willing to do the hard work necessary to hone his skills, and you also believe him as a charismatic, selfish leader whose hint of madness is as attractive as it is troubling.
  Very negative
But this is ultimately a frustrating work.
  Negative
"The Walk" has everything it needs to be a modern classic, except for an understanding that when you have everything you need to make a such a film, it doesn't need to hype itself and explain itself.
  Positive
It can just be.
  Neutral
