First, a confession: I have never played any incarnation of Warcraft.
  Neutral
Im just going to put that out there right now be up front about it.
  Neutral
Were all friends here.
  Neutral
We should be honest with each other.
  Positive
So I went in with an open mind to Warcraft, the movie based on the video game, and Im reviewing it purely on its own merits as a stand-alone entity.
  Positive
Many of you out there may read this and cry foul: Shes never played the game!
  Negative
She has no idea what shes talking about!
  Neutral
And Im OK with that.
  Positive
Really, I am.
  Negative
But Im also hoping that the game is more emotionally engaging or at least, you know, fun than the movie I just saw.
  Positive
Because that thing was a dour mess.
  Negative
And it brings me no joy to report that to you because Warcraft comes from a filmmaker whose work Ive been a big fan of:  Duncan Jones.
  Positive
With just two features to his credit, Jones has shown a real knack for taking complex, sci-fi stories and telling them in clever, intimate ways.
  Positive
His debut,  Moon, was my favorite movie of ' it was about mind-blowing, existential stuff but it had real verve, immediacy and heart.
  Positive
Plus: If one  Sam Rockwell is good, two Sam Rockwells are great.
  Positive
Jones  follow-up, the time-travel puzzle  Source Code, felt like a bit of a let-down by comparison but it was thrilling and challenging, and it showed his evolution as a filmmaker with a bigger cast and more expensive toys.
  Positive
So its hard to figure out what happened with Jones and Warcraft.
  Neutral
Its as if the endeavor swallowed him whole.
  Neutral
This was clearly a formidable undertaking filled with sweeping imagery, motion-capture performances and tons of visual effects, all being projected in overwhelming IMAX -D.
  Positive
In the midst of all that, its difficult to hear his voice to see his attention to detail.
  Negative
An enormous budget and state-of-the-art technology have resulted in a movie that looks cheesy and cartoonish a big-screen version of a video game world that more closely resembles the video game commercials you see on TV.
  Negative
But Warcraft is difficult to follow from both a visual and a narrative perspective, with massive battle scenes between orcs and humans in which its difficult to tell whos doing what to whom.
  Negative
Similar to luggage at the airport, many orcs look alike.
  Negative
Hulking, tusked, muscular and festooned with fierce accoutrements, theyre like refugees from a GWAR concert.
  Positive
But eventually you dont know whether youre looking at a good orc or a bad orc, and the CGI spectacle of it all renders everything with a glossy, detached sameness.
  Negative
Forgive me for wanting a little realism in my orcs.
  Negative
Because yes, thats what Warcraft is about: orcs and humans, and their noisy efforts to enter each others realms and destroy each other.
  Negative
But the mythology is much more dense than that' the script from Jones and  Charles Leavitt contains reams of expository dialogue, yet the story itself feels mind-bogglingly convoluted.
  Negative
And yet, in between the self-serious, stilted conversations, we get snippets of quippy, anachronistic banter that are meant to provide humor but instead end up being jarring.
  Negative
The film begins with orc warrior chief Durotan  Toby Kebbell, his pregnant wife, Draka  Anna Galvin, and their clan leaving their dying world by passing through a portal that looks like a wall of swirly, minty mouthwash.
  Negative
On the other side is the more peaceful and pastoral Azeroth although every sparkly, new fantasy realm we enter here calls to mind a place weve visited previously at some point in the Lord of the Rings saga.
  Negative
Theres a lot of borrowing going on in Warcraft.
  Neutral
Once they arrive, they attack the humans for control of the land: knights led by Durotans counterpart, the noble but personality-free Lothar  Travis Fimmel, the Brooklyn pickle entrepreneur of  Rebecca Millers Maggies Plan.
  Negative
But while Lothar dutifully serves his king  Dominic Cooper and queen  Ruth Negga, Durotan begins to question the motives of the clearly insane and power-hungry orc warlock Guldan  Daniel Wu.
  Negative
The fact that Guldan has pulsating green eyes and likes to drain people of their life force to fuel his own magical abilities may have something to do with it.
  Positive
The humans have a powerful wizard of their own: Medivh, or  The Guardian, as hes known.
  Positive
Hes played by  Ben Foster in a bit of casting alone that suggests perhaps hes not to be trusted.
  Neutral
And sure enough, Foster tries to bring glimmers of his trademark menace to the character, but its hard to act amid all the noise.
  Negative
Basically, hes called upon to transport himself and others from place to place by stringing together strands of glowing, blue light and chanting a few spells.
  Negative
In the midst of this struggle is Garona  Paula Patton, whos half human, half orc.
  Negative
The fact that shes being held prisoner and is dressed in chains and tatters for maximum sex appeal provides an uncomfortable racial element to the action, but Warcraft seems more interested in exploiting her character for titillation rather than exploring her significance from a societal perspective.
  Negative
Between this and the latest  Adam Sandler Netflix debacle,  The Do-Over, the charismatic Patton is having a rough couple of weeks.
  Negative
She deserves better.
  Positive
Eventually, alliances must be forged to save humanity and orc-kind alike.
  Negative
But first, young mage Khadgar  Ben Schnetzer, an ally of Lothars, must learn the secrets hidden inside a purple room thats meant to be futuristic but looks like a rejected set from Logans Run.
  Negative
Theres also a giant, evil statue made of clay that comes to life, but its more unintentionally hilarious than frightening.
  Positive
And before there can be any peace, there is pummeling lots and lots of pummeling as the orcs fight the humans as well as each other under hot, dusty skies.
  Negative
It is brutal.
  Negative
It is repetitive.
  Negative
It is numbing.
  Negative
And just as its ending, Warcraft leaves all kinds of plot threads dangling for the ambitious possibility of a sequel.
  Negative
But youll be likely to cry Game Over because this first one is easily a contender for the worst movie of the year.
  Negative
