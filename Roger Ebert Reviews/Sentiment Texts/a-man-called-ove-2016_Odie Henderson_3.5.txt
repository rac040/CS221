A Man Called Ove tells the familiar story of the curmudgeonly old man whose grumpy life is brightened by forces beyond his control.
  Negative
These forces take the guise of a much younger person who provides a sense of purpose for the old hero.
  Negative
A film like this rises or falls not only with its central performance, but also with its ability to engage the viewers emotions in a credible, honest fashion.
  Positive
Movies like this tend to get dismissed as manipulative because audience sympathy for the protagonist is at least partially elicited by flashbacks to a litany of tragic or unfair past events.But all movies are manipulative by default' the effectiveness of that manipulation is the more valid measurement to inspect.
  Negative
On that scale, A Man Called Ove is a morbidly funny and moving success.
  Positive
Adapting Frederick Backmans Swedish best seller, writerdirector  Hannes Holm doesnt veer too far from the storytelling structure weve come to expect.
  Negative
Instead, he tweaks expectations with the way he presents the material, and his grip on the films tricky, tragicomic tone is masterful.
  Positive
For example, several flashbacks are cleverly presented as the life flashing before ones eyes moments triggered by the suicide attempts of Ove  Rolf Lassgrd.
  Negative
Ove is a widower whose daily visits to his recently deceased wifes gravesite end with his verbal promise to join her in the afterlife.
  Negative
His failures of self-annihilation are due more to bad timing than botched attempts he is constantly interrupted by neighbors or some distracting event going on in his housing complex.
  Negative
Priding himself on his reliability, Ove feels compelled to stop killing himself to address each interruption.
  Negative
Keep in mind that the black humor in this situation doesnt arise from any mockery of Oves pain over missing his spouse.
  Negative
That is presented as real, understandable pain.
  Negative
Instead, the humor comes from Oves stubbornness as a creature of habit.
  Negative
Perpetually enforcing neighborhood rules nobody cares about nor adheres to, Ove cant resist the opportunity to scold those who violate them.
  Negative
Yet, for all his crabbiness, theres a level of selflessness inherent in Oves character, a trait he finds infuriating yet he begrudgingly accepts.
  Negative
His wife, Sonja, played as a young woman in the flashbacks by  Ida Engvoll, sees this in the younger version of Ove  Filip Berg, and the much older Ove acknowledges it after much bitching and griping.
  Very negative
Its almost as if Sonja is sending him interruptions from beyond the grave just so he can have an excuse to complain to her like hes done every day since her passing.
  Negative
This compulsive adherence to routine will keep Ove distracted.
  Negative
Also distracting Ove is the new, young family who moves next door to him.
  Negative
They start off on the wrong foot by crushing his mailbox while ignoring his sign about not driving in the area, and the noise from their young kids is a major annoyance to the childless Ove.
  Very negative
Though the husband is originally from the area, his pregnant wife Parvaneh  Bahar Pars is of Iranian descent and new to the country.
  Negative
It is she who constantly irritates Ove while simultaneously endearing herself and her family to him.
  Positive
Many of his suicide attempts are interrupted by her, and their eventual father-daughter style bond is often predicated on Oves opinion that his help is required because he thinks her husband is an idiot.
  Negative
You survived struggle in Iran, moving here and learning a new language, and being married to that idiot, Ove tells her after taking up the task of her driving instructor, driving a car should be no problem!
  Negative
Of course, she cant drive it wherever Ove has those no driving signs everybody else ignores.
  Negative
Admittedly, A Man Called Ove throws everything but the kitchen sink at poor Ove.
  Negative
Theres a shocking death early on that haunts him and us, and he is the recipient of several slights by higher ups at work and in the government.
  Negative
The marriage between the shy Ove and the jovial Sonja is full of love but fraught with personal tragedies.
  Negative
Theres an almost Job-like mercilessness to some of the fates that befall him, yet the film never dwells on them.
  Negative
Instead, theyre presented rather stoically and serve as a means for us to understand why Ove is who he is.
  Negative
This is a movie that softens its hero by giving him a cat, which sounds syrupy until you see how jacked up and scraggly this cat is.
  Negative
He likes to shit in private, says Ove to Parvaneh.
  Negative
Please give him that courtesy.
  Neutral
One gets the sense that the novel and the award-winning film version is so beloved because Ove represents a Scandinavian everyman who saunters on no matter what life throws at him.
  Very positive
His admirable resilience toughens like leather, and his love of Saab and hatred of Volvo plays like a beautiful in-joke aimed straight at the hearts of his compatriots.
  Positive
That rivalry even costs him a friendship, though that same friends subplot also presents Ove angrily battling the unfeeling agents of bureaucracy that caused him such agony as a young man.
  Negative
Holm pulls everything together in a well-crafted, satisfying package that is nicely balanced between comedy and pathos.
  Very positive
As Ove, Lassgrd gives one of the years best performances.
  Positive
Hes well supported by the other actors and the aforementioned cat, but this is a rich, complex performance that is both funny and moving.
  Very positive
It would have been easy to just let Ove coast by on his amusing grouchiness, but Lassgrd lets us see so deeply under that protective exterior.
  Neutral
We feel as if weve walked a mile in Oves shoes and absorbed his catharsis as our own.
  Negative
