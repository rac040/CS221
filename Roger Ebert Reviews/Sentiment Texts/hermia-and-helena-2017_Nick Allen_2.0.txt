Hermia amp' Helena is primarily the story of Camila  Agustina Muoz, a young woman from Buenos Aires who takes up an artistic residency in New York City to do a translation of Shakespeares A Midsummer Nights Dream, while wading through some drama of her own.
  Negative
Her tale is told in a manner not too differently from Master of None, agreeing with the  Aziz Ansari Netflix show that characters and their experiences can thrive episodically.
  Negative
But as a type of mini mini-series about the low-key dramatic world of Camila, Matias Pieiros Hermia amp' Helenas touch-and-go approach weakens the movies key expression of being a relatable story about being lost during your late searly s. Played by frequent Pieiro collaborator Muoz, is quickly an intriguing character, but Pieiros script feels slight when magnifying what makes her interesting.
  Negative
Shes clearly going through a lot, as a translator wrestling a timeless text, a daughter to a father that she doesnt know, a friend to people whose lives are more collected back in Buenos Aires, and as a girlfriend to a young man back home who has no idea about the New Yorker  Keith Poulson with whom she spends intimate time.
  Negative
But these attributes, as explored through undercooked, episodic pieces that take us back and forth in time and from Buenos Aires to New York and back again, rarely inspire curiosity, in spite of the focused performance from Muoz.
  Negative
Even the Shakespearean context that shes placed in, the text literally projected over her face in some instances, becomes another attribute that feels prepared to be either taken or left by the viewer.
  Very negative
This is Pieiros fourth movie, which is surprising as the movie smacks of a greener talent who has plenty of ideas but no way to make them seamless.
  Negative
Instead, while the film isnt visually bland in the slightest for a story that heavily relies on location and dialogue, it shoves together different things: economical fillmmaking that often zeroes in on hands, spinning  wide shots that observe one person through a large NYC park.
  Negative
Theres even a brief moment where were subjected to the student film made by Camilas long-lost fling, a five-minute cut-up of Daphne Du Mauriers Rebecca.
  Negative
And when Hermia amp' Helena wants to be delicate, as with overlapping images of a NY bridge with that of Argentinian nature, used as a slow visual transition, it comes across as obvious even if pretty to look at.
  Negative
A type of silver lining, Pieiro proves to be an unpredictable filmmaker.
  Positive
As both a survey of Camilas relationships and a creaky indie enterprise, Hermia amp' Helena does loosen everything up with its consistent use of Scott Joplin ragtime tunes.
  Negative
But the whole thing is perhaps too reserved, like with a scene in which she interviews her father, which is anticipated like a delicate climax.
  Negative
Instead, its an assortment of acting beats, with very real emotion registering as a third or fourth filmmaking priority.
  Positive
Hermia amp' Helena presents a unique anomaly its able to capture life at its most low-key but still manages to exemplify style over substance.
  Neutral
