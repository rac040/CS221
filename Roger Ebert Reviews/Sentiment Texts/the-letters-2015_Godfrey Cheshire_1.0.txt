Combine the subject of religious faith with the cinematic genius of a  Robert Bresson and you get a masterpiece like Diary of a Country Priest, a film stirring enough to move even staunch skeptics.
  Very positive
Unfortunately, the subject is more often approached by lesser talents, resulting in movies like  William Rieads The Letters, about the life of Mother Teresa, a drama in which belief is reduced to well-meaning but inert treacle.
  Very negative
To give the film credit where some is due: the look created by cinematographer  Jack Green and production designer Aman Vidhate is handsome and commendably expensive looking, even when the setting is the most miserable slum in Calcutta.
  Negative
Whether it was the Vatican or another source that provided the movies funding, they got their moneys worth in terms of production value.
  Positive
On the level of dramatization, however, the film is almost an object lesson in how not to tell a story like that of Mother Teresa.
  Negative
We start out learning that a woman with a tumor says she has been healed by a photograph of the recently departed nun, which sets Teresa on the fast track to sainthood.
  Negative
Investigating her candidacy for the church, a Vatican priest  Rutger Hauer visits Father Celeste van Exem Max Von Sydow, who had been her spiritual advisor for many years, and who narrates her story by using letters she wrote him over several decades.
  Negative
When his account begins, its just after World War II and Sister Theresa  Juliet Stevenson is living in a Calcutta convent, where she teaches well-to-do Christian girls, and tries to allay their fears regarding the Hindu-Muslim violence thats erupting due to the approach of Indias independence.
  Negative
Here as after, shes a model of blandly upbeat piety.
  Negative
The best counsel she has offer her worried charges is, Try not to worry.
  Positive
This section of the film also introduces one of the films creakiest devices: having the political context explained by reporters talking with each other.
  Positive
It involves dialogue as awful and straightforward as, So you think India is going to suffer under the burden of its birth as a modern nation?
  Negative
As we learn early on, Teresa is not content with her relatively comfortable situation in the nunnery.
  Negative
After receiving instructions from God which thankfully we dont hear while on a train ride, she proclaims that its her mission to try alleviating the misery she sees all around her in Calcutta.
  Negative
But this is easier to proclaim than to do, necessitating a procession of dull, repetitious scenes in which her superiors at the convent resist her campaign even as her appeals to the Vatican stretch on for months.
  Negative
She eventually succeeds, and is granted permission to keep her vows and affiliation with the convent while being allowed to work in the slum outside it.
  Positive
There, her main challenge is overcoming the suspicions of its Hindu residents.
  Negative
Initially, shes not out to provide food to the starving or care to the ill.
  Negative
She says she just wants to teach the kids to read, but the slum dwellers think she aims to convert the tykes to Christianity.
  Negative
Naturally, her purity of intent soon becomes apparent to most of the skeptical Hindus, and her career as a savior of the slums is off and running.
  Negative
Some of her former students even elect to join her, creating consternation among their parents and the convent higher-ups.
  Negative
This is, after all, a caste-bound society and upper-class girls touching the untouchables, even in Jesus name, is frowned upon.
  Positive
Soon enough, though, Teresas mission is successful enough that she gets the Vatican to let her break free of the convent and establish her own independent Missionaries of Charity, which leads to more conflict with the Hindus but also to the beginnings of her worldwide renown for saintliness.
  Negative
The films biggest problem is indicated by its title.
  Negative
Mother Teresa did leave behind a trove of letters.
  Negative
Though she wanted them burned, a selection that was published posthumously revealed her prolonged spiritual struggles and sense that she was wholly removed from God.
  Negative
A few of these missives are quoted briefly in the movie, but they are completely at odds with what we see on screen, where theres zero evidence of the protagonists internal conflicts or devastating doubts.
  Negative
Stevensons performance as the nun relies on a stooped posture, vaguely Yugoslavian accent and that blandly benign smile.
  Negative
Doubtless she was not given the material for a more complex portrayal.
  Negative
Some films on faith preach only to the converted.
  Neutral
This one may leave even some of those unmoved.
  Negative
A final note: The films music is credited to  Ciaran Hope, but unless the copy provided for review contained temp tracks, some of it seems to have been lifted directly from  Hans Zimmers score for  The Thin Red Line.
  Negative
