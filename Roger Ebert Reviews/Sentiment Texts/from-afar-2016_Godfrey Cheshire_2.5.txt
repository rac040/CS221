While the fact that  Lorenzo Vigas polished but clichd From Afar won the prestigious Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival suggests that it must have been a particularly weak year for the worlds oldest major film fest, theres an appropriate irony in the victorys locale.
  Negative
For the Venezuelan feature is the latest to descend from  Death in Venice, the granddaddy of all older-gay-man-lusting-after-virile-youth films.
  Neutral
Both  Luchino Viscontis fin-de-sicle template based on  Thomas Manns novella and Vigas contemporary iteration have a certain cinematic pull.
  Neutral
They involve copious amounts of desire-charged looking, and the protagonists visual pursuit of his amorous object can be read as a corollary for every cinematic spectators concupiscent gaze.
  Negative
But theres difference in the older and the latter-day ways of telling such stories.
  Neutral
In Death in Venice, desire remains unrequited, both emotionally and sexually, which reason might suggest is an accurate appraisal of the fates of such situations in real life.
  Negative
In the newer versions, a certain kind of fantasy meshes with or entirely trumps reality: the younger man eventually responds emotionally to the older, and theres usually a sexual convergence as well, however brief and furtive it may be.
  Negative
In the realm of gay features, such films in which the younger man is often a hustler or criminal are so numerous as to comprise an entire subgenre.
  Positive
Among the movies aimed at top-drawer festivals, on the other hand, theyre rare enough to be taken as exceptional.
  Positive
And some occasionally are:  Robin Campillos Eastern Boys, which debuted at Venice a couple of years earlier, is a better example of the form, one offering more originality and emotional force than Vigas film.
  Positive
From Afar, in any case, is built on reticence.
  Negative
When it opens, middle-aged Armando  Alfredo Castro spots an attractive young man at a Caracas bus stop, then follows him onto a bus.
  Negative
The younger guy can tell what Armandos gaze implies and appears slightly repulsed, until his suitor flashes a wad of bills.
  Negative
Then theyre back at Armandos darkened apartment, where he instructs the boy to turn around, take off his shirt, pull his pants down halfway and stand still as he masturbates.
  Negative
So this is Armandos pattern: Its all about looking and self-pleasuring, not emotional connection.
  Negative
Possible reasons for his outlook are suggested in a subsequent scene where he and his sister discuss the recent return to town of their father, a powerful businessman whom they apparently hate for reasons unspecified.
  Negative
With this family dynamic coloring the background, Armando continues his pursuit of the young and available.
  Positive
The lithe, sullen Elder  Luis Silva, who looks  or , though, is not as compliant as some.
  Negative
He beats Armando up and takes money and a valuable item or two from his apartment.
  Positive
Nothing about the film suggests that its protagonist is a masochist, but hes sufficiently taken with Elder that he goes after him and strikes up a relationship of sorts, in part by doling out money for things the boy wants, such as a refurbished sports car.
  Negative
It emerges that like Armando, Elder also has daddy issues.
  Negative
This presumably is meant to explain something about the conjunction of the two, but its a rather trite psychological idea thats never persuasively developed.
  Negative
Instead, Vigas script gives us various side issues and opaque conflicts, such as Elders violent confrontation with his girlfriends brothers, which adds some visceral tension but is never explained.
  Negative
What follows contains no spoilers, but its worth noting that when, in the storys latter sections, it takes the expected turn toward emotional and sexual engagement between the two main characters, it also waxes more formulaic and less credible.
  Negative
Very suddenly, after a day at the coast, Elder leaves off being surly and becomes so friendly toward Armando that he invites him to a family party where some of the boys relatives, sensing that somethings going on between the two, are outraged.
  Negative
While Elders decision makes very little sense given the cultural context and hes been presented as so dim and loutish that we cant credit him with making a deliberate statement it perhaps proves that a filmmaker can get away with a lot of affronts to common sense as long as his movies surface is expertly wrought.
  Positive
And From Afars certainly is.
  Positive
Vigas, whose debut this is, mustve aced his finals in Modernist Art Film , because the movie has a cool, understated look and plenty of clever touches in its compositions and use of variable focus.
  Positive
The filmmaker also does a more than capable job with his lead actors, the Chilean Castro proving expertly restrained and quiescent while Silva is all cockiness and coiled volatility.
  Very positive
Guillermo Arriaga " Amores Perros," "  Grams" is also credited with co-writing the films story, which perhaps helps explain its narrative weaknesses.
  Negative
For though it doesnt feature the scrambled chronologies or sudden shifts of locale that marked Amores Perros and  Grams, From Afar suffers from the writers way of using disjuncture and opacity to suggest meaning where, if you look closely enough, there really is none at least none beyond the tired conventions on which many Death in Venice-descended films rest.
  Negative
