Transformers: The Last Knight opens and closes with chaos.
  Neutral
The first scene features bodies flying everywhere as flames pierce the sky in  Michael Bays reimagining of the Knights of the Round Table, in which Merlins magic is a gift from the alien robots so many know and love.
  Negative
The last scenes, and this is no spoiler if youve ever seen a Michael Bay movie, feature bodies flying everywhere as metal and flames pierce the sky.
  Negative
In between, theres a bit of mythology, some running and screaming, a ton of slo-mo, a dash of racism, a great actor wasted in a character who could have been named Exposition Dump, and so much incoherent noise that youll want to bang your head on the seat in front of you just to get some rest.
  Negative
After two sequels that took the fun spirit of the  Transformers and turned them into something with the artistic depth of a Monster Energy Drink, Bay appeared to reboot the franchise with the relatively solid  Transformers: Age of Extinction.
  Positive
He found one of our most charismatic leading men in  Mark Wahlberg, gave him an awesomely perfect name like Cade Yeager, filled out a better-than-average supporting cast, and provided major set pieces across the world, including leveling a bit more destruction at Chicago.
  Positive
AoE suffered from Bay Bloat  minutes!
  Neutral
and some of the other technical problems of the previous sequels, but it offered hope.
  Neutral
Hope dies during "Transformers: The Last Knight."
  Neutral
From the very beginning, this is an incoherent mess.
  Negative
Cades daughter and her boyfriend both memorable characters from the last film are gone, the daughter written off with a couple of horrendously manipulative beats about her being at college and Yeager being on the run.
  Positive
He can save the world but he cant see his daughter.
  Neutral
Whatever, fine, but also gone are  Stanley Tucci other than a brief cameo as Merlin in the opening scenes and  Kelsey Grammer.
  Negative
The villains of the first film are replaced here by a purely CGI enemy named Quintessa  Gemma Chan, an interstellar being who wants to use the home planet of the Transformers to destroy Earth by basically crashing them into one another.
  Negative
Shes such a cartoonish, poorly designed villain that she never feels like a real threat.
  Very negative
Im getting ahead of myself.
  Neutral
The Last Knight picks up relatively where the last film left off.
  Negative
Optimus Prime is headed back to his home planet to tell the universe to leave Earth alone.
  Negative
Yeager is now in hiding, as being a massive alien robot is still against international law, and he's still aligned with the remaining Autobots.
  Negative
Hes in hiding in the biggest auto field in the Midwest, but those kind of logical leaps are easy to let slide in a summer blockbuster when its working.
  Positive
He has a new assistant  Jerrod Carmichael, is working on repairing Bumblebee, and gets a spunky preteen sidekick who feels like the character sitcoms used to add late in their run when everyone knew the original kids got too old think Sam on Diff'rent Strokes.
  Negative
And then pretty much all of the set-up including any sort of immigration analogy about the fear of foreigners represented by the hunted Transformers is thrown out.
  Negative
Theres a point in the script when you can literally tell when it was handed to a different writing crew.
  Negative
It starts as one movie and then, bizarrely, takes a hard-right turn to England and becomes something else entirely.
  Negative
You see, Yeager found a talisman on a dying transformer, and that relic ties him to the long and storied history of the aliens.
  Negative
As these films have grown in budget, Bay has piled on more and more mythology, and I think the reason this is billed as the final chapter is because theres literally nowhere else to go.
  Very negative
Through remarkably expository scenes courtesy of Sir  Anthony Hopkins and  John Turturro, we learn that people have known about the Transformers for centuries and that notable geniuses like Mozart and FDR helped keep their existence a secret.
  Positive
In return, the robots gave the human race gifts, including the Transformer watch that killed Hitler.
  Negative
No, Im not making that up.
  Neutral
Weaving the mythology of these killer cars into world history isnt a bad idea, and reflects the tongue-in-cheek pleasure these movies could have been Id watch the heck out of Bumblebee vs. The Third Reich but its all so thinly and poorly handled here.
  Negative
Before you can truly enjoy it, were back with the revelation that Cade now has a connection with the Transformers because of the talisman and because of some other nonsense I couldnt begin to explain and his new gorgeous friend Vivian  Laura Haddock is the only one who can wield Merlins staff, a necessary skill to save the Earth.
  Negative
Youre saying, How could a movie that weaves together metal dragons, Merlins staff, Sir Anthony Hopkins and world-killing aliens be all that bad?
  Negative
Because its just not fun.
  Positive
More than any film Bay has made, "The Last Knight" is incoherent to the point of parody.
  Negative
Action scenes are poorly choreographed, dialogue is weaker than ever, and plot twists make no sense.
  Very negative
At one point, the leads are on a submarine and I couldnt for the life of me tell you why.
  Positive
Not only is it transparent that no one involved bothered with the plot Wahlberg has never given such a lazy performance as he does here but the editing and effects are stunningly shoddy.
  Very negative
Theres no geography to any of the scenes, so you cant tell what the heck is happening.
  Negative
At least the last film had a few action set pieces that worked and the third film had the destruction of Chicago to wow viewers.
  Positive
This film does not have a single memorable action sequence in it.
  Negative
And it starts at such a ridiculous pitch that it has nowhere to go Yeager is reintroduced shooting a robot in slow motion.
  Negative
Bay has always been willing to forego things like rising action or building tension to try and blast viewers to their seats from first frame to last.
  Negative
But it gets so exhausting to watch another movie that starts at  and then never varies the volume.
  Negative
Heres where the chorus of Critic-Proof Franchises kicks in.
  Negative
Michael Bay made this for fans of the franchise and not the notoriously-hard-on-it critics.
  Neutral
Diehards will ignore that I liked the first film and parts of the third and fourth films the second is still a cinematic abomination.
  Positive
I get it.
  Neutral
We love to forgive the failures of franchises we adore.
  Neutral
Even critics do that.
  Neutral
But even fans of this series have to take a hard look at the outright, shocking laziness of this movie one that does the bare minimum to get butts in seats.
  Negative
Even in bad action movies, theres often a glimpse of artistic potential gone awry or attempts to entertain that just didnt work.
  Negative
I began to actively try to find that here, to find a way to see how this went off the rails.
  Negative
I came to the conclusion that no one cared.
  Neutral
Theres just so little effort to make sense or make it interesting, even for the fans.
  Negative
It was a contractual obligation and a paycheck.
  Negative
They could have called it Transformers: Someone Needs a New Beach House.
  Neutral
