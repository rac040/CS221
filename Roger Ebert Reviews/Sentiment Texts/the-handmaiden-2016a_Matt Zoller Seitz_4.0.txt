Park Chan-Wooks The Handmaiden is a love story, revenge thriller and puzzle film set in Japanese-occupied Korea in the s.
  Positive
It is voluptuously beautiful, frankly sexual, occasionally perverse and horrifically violent.
  Positive
At times its very existence feels inexplicable.
  Negative
And yet all of its disparate pieces are assembled with such care, and the characters written and acted with such psychological acuity, that you rarely feel as if the writer-director is rubbing the audiences nose in excess of one kind or another.
  Negative
This is a film made by an artist at the peak of his powers: Park, a South Korean director who started out as a critic, has many great or near-great genre films, including Oldboy, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, Lady Vengeance and  Thirst, but this one is so intricate yet light-footed that it feels like the summation of his career to date.
  Positive
Its also as inspiring an example of East-West cross-pollination as cinema has given us, on par with  Akira Kurosawas adaptations of Shakespeare, Dostoevsky and Dashiell Hammett in its ability to submerge a respected source while keeping its outlines visible.
  Negative
The plot faintly evokes many Gothic thrillers chiefly "Rebecca," "Jane Eyre" and "Gaslight" and quite a few examples of film noir as well' Parks source is  Sarah Waters Fingersmith, a  novel set in Dickensian England that was previously made as a  British miniseries.
  Negative
The result seems at once specifically English, specifically Korean and not of this astral plane' like Parks best work, its an expressionistic, at times surreal movie that skates along the knife-edge of dreams.
  Positive
Every frame pulses with life, sometimes with blood.
  Positive
The script tells of a spirited female pickpocket named Sooki, actually named Tamako  Kim Tae-ri, who gets a job as a handmaiden at the estate of a rich old book collector Lee Yong-nyeo, serving him and Lady Hideko Kim Min-hee, the niece of his late wife' she gets pulled into a scheme by a fake count who wants to marry the niece and have her committed to an asylum so that he can claim her fortune' the book collector, the fake counts mentor, has more or less the same plan in mind.
  Negative
Frankly, Im not that interested in money itself, says the fake count, who was raised by a Korean fisherman but claims to be Japanese and calls himself Fujiwara  Ha Jung-woo.
  Negative
What I desire is how shall I put it?
  Neutral
the manner of ordering wine without looking at the price.
  Negative
The plan is fiendishly complicated, but it grows thornier still when SookiTamako starts falling in love with her target.
  Negative
Their blossoming affair is tenderly observed a startlingly blunt sex scene is delayed until fairly deep into the film, and preceded by many scenes that pivot upon subtle glances, overheard remarks, and moments where one woman rushes to the others defense.
  Positive
The fake count is handsome and can be dashing at times Ha looks so at home in a tuxedo that you could imagine him wearing it to a supermarket but hes also pig who seems to revel in his piggishness, and his intended target sees through him immediately.
  Negative
When he calls her mesmerizing over a tense dinner, she replies, Men use the word mesmerizing when they wish to touch a ladys breasts.
  Positive
Hes upfront about his utter cyncism and lack of affection for Lady Hideko, a crushed flower of a woman who was raised from girlhood as a virtual prisoner by the book collector after well, lets just call it a tragedy, because now were at the point in this review where describing any specific moment or scene from The Handmaiden in detail would rob readers of one of the great pleasures of watching a densely plotted, elegantly executed motion picture: having no idea of whats about to happen next, yet nearly always being surprised and enthralled by both the twist itself and the films presentation of it.
  Very negative
So here we go, somewhat vaguely, into the breach: nothing is what it seems in this movie, and the things that arent what they seem arent quite what they dont seem to be, if that makes any sense at all and if it doesnt right now, trust me: it will.
  Negative
Most of the story takes place in and around the book collectors country estate, a splendidly realized creation thats not just one of the great mansions in film history rivaled in recent movies only by the estate in another modern Gothic romance,  Crimson Peak but also an organizing metaphor for the whole film.
  Negative
It seems to change size and shape depending on a visitors angle of approach, and once youre inside it, the geography at first seems so clear that you could draw floor plans of its most frequently used spaces' but after a few more scenes, you realize that you only saw a small part of the house, and not only are there rooms and wings youve never laid eyes on, there are secret doors and hidden passageways that only certain characters know about, leading to places where they can go to make love, commit sadistic acts of violence, or spy on each other.
  Very negative
Soon enough, the movie teaches you how to watch it, and you start asking questions, like, What does this person truly hope to gain from sneaking here, doing this, stealing that?
  Negative
and Are they really spying in secret, or do the spied-upon people know somebody is watching?"
  Neutral
and Are the emotions being expressed by that character real, or are they faking it, or are they seeming to fake it while actually feeling those feelings?
  Negative
A good many moments resonate not because of what one character is saying, but because of the looks on other characters faces as they hear their words and either contemplate their true meaning or visualize images to accompany them.
  Positive
One of many show-stopping setpieces is a reading of perverse erotica from the book collectors library, accompanied by one of the weirdest sex shows in mainstream cinema, but most of the sequences eerie power derives from observing the rapt expressions of men whove gathered to hear explicit fiction read aloud.
  Neutral
Nearly as powerful, though far subtler, are the cross-cut sequences that feel like self-contained short stories of their own.
  Positive
Dialogue or recited scraps of letters or fiction become de facto narration laid over a cascade of images, brilliantly composed for a very wide frame by Chung Chung-hoon, and backed by Cho Young-wuks hypnotically repetitive yet rapturously melodramatic score, which rises to operatic heights when the characters are experiencing misery, ecstasy or fear.
  Negative
Parks sense of texture and color seems as intuitive as a painters, but the films narrative construction is as right-brained as  Christopher Nolan at his wonkiest.
  Negative
"The Handmaiden" is neatly diced into thirds, each approximately  minutes long, each narrated by a different major character with parenthetical mini-narratives embedded within each, Russian nesting doll-style.
  Negative
As you ease into the middle third, you start to see moments and images revisited from different angles, seen or heard from fresh vantage points, or picked up slightly earlier or slightly later, altering their meaning or revealing previously withheld facts.
  Positive
The result is a rare film that could be equally well-represented by a billboard-sized collage of randomly chose still-frames, and a flowchart.
  Positive
Even listening to the same story, people imagine different things, a character warns us, so deep into the movie that the line plays not like a revelation, but a confirmation of what we weve been feeling in our marrow.
  Negative
As you might have deduced, The Handmaiden is a story that is also about storytelling, and writing, and picture making, and the obsessive-compulsive attention to detail that links so many great artists throughout history, regardless of medium, worldview or temperament.
  Positive
The movie is filled with literal and figurative nods to the act of artistic creation, from the loving close-ups of the book collectors treasured volumes, the drawings and paintings made by Hideko and the fake count he was originally hired to tutor her, and the shots of calligraphic sentences scratched onto letters and scrolls, to the way that blood spilled by lovemaking or disfigurement blooms upon mattresses and stone floors, rhyming with the lotus blossoms glimpsed in trees over the characters' heads, the eruptions of green that accompany transitions from indoors to outdoors, extreme closeups of voyeurs' eyeballs, and shots of a full moon so bright that it seems to be burning a hole through the clouds.
  Negative
These touches are all striking in their own right.
  Positive
But they never feel ostentatiously disconnected from the story and characters.
  Negative
The Handmaiden is about a lot of things, among them trust and vulnerability, imprisonment and freedom, and the tension between the authentic self and the faade that individuals create, and that society imposes from without.
  Positive
Park never loses track of these ideas or forgets about them, but they never expressed in tediously rhetorical terms always in a gliding, playful, often audaciously musical way.
  Negative
"The Handmaiden" stirs the senses by appealing to our gut feelings, our sense of morals and ethics, and our appreciation for the sight of great artists making magic as if its the easiest thing in the world.
