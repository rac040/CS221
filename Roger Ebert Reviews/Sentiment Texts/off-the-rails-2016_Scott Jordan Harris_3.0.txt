I have spent more than half of my adult life in prison, says Darius McCollum.
  Negative
Films have taught us what to think of people who say that.
  Neutral
But unless you already know his name and if you live inNew Yorktheres a good chance you do then whatever assumptions you are making about McCollum are probably wrong.
  Negative
The charismatic man at the center of  Adam Irvings new documentary has been jailed  times for working forNew Yorks Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
  Negative
The problem is that they dont employ him.
  Negative
He repeatedly steals buses and subway trains, and drives them safely to where they need to go.
  Negative
McCollum has Aspergers syndrome and, like many people on the autism spectrum, he has an obsessive passion that consumes much of his life.
  Negative
For some its drawing, for others its a TV show.
  Neutral
For McCollum its trains.
  Positive
Ever since I was  years old Ive been running towards the subway system, he says.
  Negative
Actually, its longer than that.
  Neutral
Hes been running to the subway since he was a small boy.
  Negative
It was just at age  that he was first arrested.
  Neutral
At school, happy and broad-smiling but also nerdy and awkward, he was badly bullied and, one day, while he sat arranging a jigsaw puzzle, another pupil stabbed him, almost fatally, with scissors.
  Very negative
After he left hospital little Darius became afraid of school and began to ride the subway all day.
  Negative
His astounding encyclopedic knowledge of trains, and his eagerness to help out, endeared him toMTAemployees, who thought of him as a kind of mascot.
  Positive
After a couple of years they gave him his own miniatureMTAuniform.
  Negative
When he was , he was allowed to operate a train under supervision, and when he was  a train driver who wanted to skip work to visit a girlfriend told Darius to take over for him.
  Negative
Darius drove a train safely through eight stops, picking up passengers and letting them off, and made all the necessary announcements.
  Negative
But someone spotted that he did not look old enough to be driving a train and so he was arrested.
  Negative
The incident made headlines.
  Neutral
Aged , and then again aged , McCollum applied to work for theMTAbut having the notorious teenage train bandit on staff seemed like bad PR, and he was rejected.
  Very negative
His obsession withNew Yorks public transport system did not diminish.
  Negative
Off The Rails uses interviews, animation and dramatic reconstructions to tell McCollums strange story but these devices are never flashy or distracting.
  Negative
With justice to fight for this could be an angry documentary but instead its a gentle one.
  Negative
In the foreground there is always McCollums daily life and in the background there is always the implication that a better society, one with more informed attitudes to autism and mental health, would be better able to deal with him.
  Negative
The films message is quiet but clear: Darius McCollum is black and  neurodivergent,and society treats him differently than it would if he were white and  neurotypical.The justice system, in particular, seems designed to chew him up.
  Negative
At one point, while McCollum is in prison for illegally driving a bus, his parents retire toNorth Carolina.
  Negative
They hope that when he is released their son will join them.
  Neutral
There he will be with those who love him and, away from the New York Subway System, he will not be able to steal its trains.
  Positive
But when he is released the conditions of his parole forbid him to leaveNew Yorkand he is soon arrested for riding the subway when he has been banned from entering it.
  Negative
He goes back to jail for another year.
  Negative
Stealing mass transit vehicles is a major offence and so, when McCollum is incarcerated, he is sent to maximum security prisons, some of which Attica, Sing Sing,RikersIsland are infamous in popular culture.
  Very negative
McCollums crimes have never harmed anyone or even caused any real disruption to theMTAand yet he is imprisoned alongside gang leaders and rapists and murderers.
  Negative
InRikersIslandhe survived a riot and was scalded when another inmate boiled baby oil and poured it over him as he slept in his cell.
  Negative
As a prisoner, McCollum consulted with theMTA.
  Negative
He advised on security and safety, and improvements were made on his recommendations.
  Negative
But when he was released theMTAwould still not employ him.
  Neutral
Even worse, while he was inside, prison authorities became concerned that his extensive knowledge of the public transport system could make him a target for incarcerated terrorists seeking to manipulate him, so he was put into segregation.
  Negative
Rules dictate that segregated prisoners be shackled, and so he was.
  Negative
Legally, the alternative to this kind of incarceration is to argue that McCollum is insane but, if he is, then the law says he is criminally insane, and that means he would be locked away indefinitely with dangerously disturbed prisoners.
  Negative
To be released, he would need to be cured of his apparently incurable compulsions.
  Negative
And so the cycle continues.
  Positive
There should be a solution but the tangle of social workers and psychiatrists and judges and lawyers and theMTAseems unable to produce one.
  Negative
Adam Irving is on McCollums side he would hardly have made this documentary if he wasnt but Off The Rails makes few appeals on McCollums behalf and commits to illustrating that, regardless of how much he is abused by the system, he is narcissistic and boastful and keen on attention.
  Negative
But even so the evidence that we need to treat neurodivergent people better than we do keeps building.
  Negative
As I wrote this review a friend asked what I was working on and I told her McCollums story.
  Positive
Why cant someone show some common sense or compassion?
  Negative
she asked.
  Neutral
This is a good question.
  Positive
Off The Rails asks it well.
  Positive
Society ought to answer.
  Neutral
