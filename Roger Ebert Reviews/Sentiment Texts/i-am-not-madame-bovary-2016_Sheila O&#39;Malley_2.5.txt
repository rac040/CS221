Director  Feng Xiaogang's "I Am Not MadameBovary," with  Fan Bingbing as the central character, is not a re-telling of Gustave Flaubert's vicious send-up of the French bourgeoisie.
  Negative
As the male voiceover informs us at the outset, as though he is launching a solemn bedtime story, the film is based on a th-century Chinese morality tale about an unfaithful wife named Pan Jinlian who conspires with her lover to kill Pan Jinlian's husband.
  Neutral
And ever since that day, "bad" women, are referred to as "Pan Jinlian."
  Negative
It is a scarlet letter.
  Neutral
The title of the film was apparently chosen because "MadameBovary" has the same connotations to Western audiences that "Pan Jinlian" does to Chinese audiences.
  Negative
"I Am Not MadameBovary," though, is not about infidelity or the lowly position of women.
  Negative
The real story is about the nature of bureaucracy, and one woman's tireless attempt to go up against The System.
  Positive
This makes the film sound weighty and political, but "I Am MadameBovary" plays out as a comedy, a lampoon of the incompetence and laziness of government officials.
  Negative
The first scene shows peasant woman Li Xuelian Fan visiting her cousin who knows about legal matters to ask him what recourse she has in terms of getting a divorce.
  Negative
Her story, rattled off to him, is incredibly complicated, and he looks more and more confused: she and her husband, trying to game the system, faked a divorce, complete with phony divorce papers, so that one of them would be eligible for the apartment they both wanted.
  Negative
The plan was that they would reunite eventually when Li Xuelian got pregnant and then they both could live in that apartment.
  Neutral
The husband broke the rules of their plan, however: he fell in love with someone else during this time treating his "fake" divorce as real, in other words, and he and his new "wife" moved into the cherished apartment, leaving Li Xuelian out in the cold.
  Negative
Her cousin suggests she present her case to the local court, which she does.
  Neutral
They don't get it.
  Negative
I don't blame them.
  Neutral
She is not put off easily.
  Negative
Her husband has put her in a horrible position and she needs to clear her name.
  Negative
She is no "Pan Jinlian."
  Neutral
And so begins her legal journey, as she sues each person who refuses to help her, eventually suing people all the way up to Beijing.
  Negative
She is a royal pain to the various county chiefs and judges and mayors: she races out in front of their cars shouting "Stop!"
  Negative
, she holds up a sign and sits in the street outside of their offices.
  Positive
She appears at their conferences in Beijing like clockwork.
  Neutral
They dread seeing her.
  Negative
The State, as shown in "I Am Not MadameBovary," is not quite as oppressive as Airstrip One in , but it is still a gigantic monolith.
  Very negative
The film is crowded with obsequious toadying officials, mediocre bored bureaucrats, and ambitious nobodies covering their asses.
  Negative
They are all men, of course.
  Neutral
Despite their power and status, each one eventually throws up his hands in helplessness at her relentlessness.
  Neutral
Her behavior doesn't quite equal the absurdities of Jarndyce and Jarndyce, the court case spanning generations in Dickens' Bleak House, but it does have a similar almost existential quality.
  Negative
Why won't they just give her what she wants so that they will leave her alone?
  Negative
"I Am Not MadameBovary" clocks in at almost two and a half hours, a pretty brutal length for a story so repetitive.
  Negative
Li Xuelian barely has a life outside of her quest.
  Negative
Everything she does is because she wants to clear her name.
  Neutral
She has a strange romance with a childhood friend who has pined for her for years, but even within that, she has one goal and one goal only.
  Positive
It's the principle of the thing to her.
  Neutral
Feng Xiaogang has chosen a distancing device for his visuals.
  Negative
The rural sections of the film are seen through a circular shape, cutting off the periphery of the screen, giving the impression that we are observing the action through a telescope.
  Negative
Or a rifle-sight.
  Neutral
When she gets to Beijing, the circular shape vanishes, and suddenly the frame is a perfect square, representing the much larger world she enters.
  Positive
The circular shape limits the amount of movement possible on the screen, and group scenes in particular suffer because of that.
  Negative
There's a stilted quality to the interactions, and everyone stands in one spot like statues.
  Negative
The intention is to create the effect of an old Chinese painting, the ones seen in the opening of the film underneath the voiceover.
  Positive
This style must have required extreme rigor on the part of everyone involved to keep the action contained enough to stay inside that circle.
  Negative
Much of the film is stunning.
  Very positive
These are moments in miniature, seen through a peephole.
  Negative
The color scheme is careful and poetic: watery greens and greys and blurring pinks in the countryside, while Beijing is all gold and red and white.
  Positive
Since much of the film involves Li Xuelian going back and forth from city to country accompanied by a thrilling percussive score by Wei Du, there is a constant circle-to-square-scene change-up for the action.
  Negative
Feng's style excludes close-ups almost exclusively' the strict framing does not permit it.
  Negative
The overall effect is so distancing that it's as though the characters are at the bottom of a well.
  Positive
There's not an uninteresting or boring shot in "I Am Not MadameBovary."
  Negative
It's a pleasure to look at the screen and to watch the artistry of the entire creative team.
  Positive
But there's a forbidding quality to the entire enterprise.
  Positive
That circular frame is way too small to squeeze through.
  Negative
