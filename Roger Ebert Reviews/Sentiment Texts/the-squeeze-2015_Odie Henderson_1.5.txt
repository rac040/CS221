Heres a movie that would benefit from being broken up by late-night television commercials.
  Neutral
The Squeeze plays like something youd stumble across on USA Network back in the days ofUp All Night.
  Negative
All thats missing is TV host Rhonda Shear and an ad for that spray paint-based fake hair in a can.
  Negative
The Squeeze even has the courtesy to end with The Proclaimers Im Gonna Be  Miles, a -year old song that will never shake its association with the dismal  Johnny Depp movie  Benny and Joon.
  Negative
Were I not  pounds heavier and decades more wrinkled, Id have sworn I was watching this in .
  Negative
The only way you might glean a favorable reviews worth of enjoyment from The Squeeze is if you like being sucked into 's-era basic cable black holes.
  Negative
There is little else worth mentioning about this derivative, clunky, haphazardly written and visually dull sports movie except the performances by  Christopher McDonald and  Michael Nouri.
  Negative
My entire star rating goes to their antagonistic gambler characters.
  Negative
They say a movie is only as good as its villains.
  Neutral
These villains are too good for The Squeeze.
  Negative
The film opens with a flash-forward of our golfer hero Augustus Maximus Baccus  Jeremy Sumpter being threatened by Nouris character, Jimmy Diamonds.
  Negative
Diamonds demands that Augie throw tomorrows golf game or else hell be killed.
  Neutral
Well have to wait  minutes before we see Jimmy D. again, because were immediately sent back to the past to learn more about Augie.
  Negative
Before we learn All About Augie, however, were assaulted by the onscreen words I wish all moviedom would ban: Based on a true story.
  Negative
That phrase often serves as an excuse for filmmakers to poorly shape scenarios and drama.
  Negative
They think well buy anything because its supposedly true.
  Neutral
Well, truth may be stranger than fiction, but it doesnt always result in good fiction.
  Neutral
Well meet the real Augie in a snapshot during the closing credits.
  Neutral
If this movie accurately reflects the real story, the only question I have for him is how does one live a life built entirely out of old movie clichs?
  Negative
Please teach me how to do this.
  Negative
But I digress.
  Positive
Its hard to get a bead on what The Squeeze wants to be tonally.
  Negative
At its core is yet another one of those tales where small-town folks somehow outwit big-city criminals with schemes so rudimentary and predictable that its hard to fathom how the criminals managed to stay employed in lives of crime.
  Negative
The first  minutes feel like a typical Christian movie, with Jesus and God appearing in almost every line of lousy dialogue.
  Negative
Then it veers away from that tone youll know exactly when it does and becomes a drama about the perils of easy money.
  Negative
Then, it takes a very suspect dive into Las Vegas sleaziness, complete with a minority character serving as an exotic Other representing sex and drugs.
  Negative
It then dives into a completely suspenseless winner-take-all golf gamehustle that ends in what I think is supposed to be comedy.
  Negative
The story kicks off when the radio broadcast of Augies record-breaking win at his hometown golf course catches the ear of an out-of-towner named Riverboat Christopher MacDonald.
  Negative
Riverboat likes to gamble on golf, and hes apparently quite the success.
  Positive
He and his partner The Bank  Katherine LaNasa seduce Augie with wads of cash he can obtain by helping them hustle unsuspecting fellow gamblers.
  Negative
Augie looks more like a pizza delivery guy than asuccessful golfer the movie literally admits this, so hes the perfect candidate.
  Positive
Plus, he needs the money to help his family out.
  Negative
Its one of these golf hustles that introduces Augie to Las Vegas, Jimmy Diamonds and the fists of Jimmys henchmen.
  Negative
As expected, theres a gorgeous, small-town girl waiting patiently for our hero to get his act together and return to her.
  Positive
In The Squeeze shes called Natalie  Jillian Murray and shes the sassy, sexy, mature and patient voice of reason whose warnings are never heeded in movies like this.
  Negative
You dont have to be Riverboat nor Jimmy Diamonds to know not to bet against the possibility that Natalie will assist in saving Jimmys ass before The Proclaimers torment us with their end-credits earworm.
  Negative
Writer-director  Terry Jastrow has a history producing golf specials and documentaries on TV.
  Neutral
Knowing this, I wish hed just made a documentary about the real Augie.
  Negative
Jastrows love of golf shines through when hes lensing the golf scenes, but the drama itself is subpar.
  Neutral
The real Augie simply telling his story to the camera would be far more compelling and entertaining than this.
  Positive
In Jastrows defense, the director does get hole-in-one level performances out of MacDonald and Nouri.
  Negative
Nouri isnt given enough screen time to be as effective as MacDonald, but their scenes together make one forget about Sumpters bland character.
  Negative
At one point, Jimmy Diamonds asks have you ever seen the Devil?
  Negative
as Riverboat enters the room, and MacDonald fits Satans shoes nicely.
  Positive
Dressed in suits and a ubiquitous hat, oozing charm and chewing on a Southern accent with the tenacity of  Meryl Streep channeling Foghorn Leghorn, MacDonald makes the movie.
  Positive
Even when hes forced by the screenplay to appear uncharacteristically sinister something Nouris character does better, MacDonald never loses his successful grasp on Riverboat.
  Negative
The Squeeze rides off into the sunset with the wrong duo of characters, leaving the villains in an awful, out of left field comic situation.
  Negative
This would have been forgivable sitting in my apartment back in , watching the cable I stole.
  Negative
As a  NYC movie ticket in , its a sucker bet I wouldnt take.
  Negative
