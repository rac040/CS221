  Negative

  Neutral
There seems to be a steady stream of such folk, since May has been employed for over two decades.
  Negative
And the government evidently has the largesse to allow him to pay for proper funerals, each with a clergyman, music, a good casket and a decent burial.
  Positive
Since they have no one else, May regards the deceased as his people, and he goes to extra lengths to serve them well.
  Negative
Researching their lives as exhaustively as limited time and resources allow, he constructs the most favorable life narrative for each that he can, and this becomes the persons eulogy.
  Negative
He also tracks down any lost relatives or friends and tries to persuade them to attend the last rites  usually without success.
  Negative
Otherwise, Mays life appears to be neat, clean and empty.
  Negative
Hes like an amalgam of the protagonists of  Henry James The Altar of the Dead and T.S. Eliots Prufrock  devoted to his dear departed while living a life measured out with coffee spoons.
  Negative
After establishing Mays routines and rituals, the story take a turn when a young, officious new superior calls him in and tells his job is being consolidated out of existence.
  Negative
Apparently the bureaucracy would rather pay for simple cremations rather than funerals, and has no need for his personal attention to detail.
  Negative
Stunned that hes only got a few days left being paid to pursue the quest thats occupied his adult life, May finds a last case that he gradually begins treating as a grand cause.
  Negative
As it happens, the deceased lived across from him, suggesting how modern city life divides communities into solitary cells.
  Negative
The mans body had not been discovered for many days, but May enters his shabby, smelly apartment and, with his usual meticulousness, begins picking through his belongings partly filled photo album, old LPs, looking for clues.
  Very negative
The portrait that emerges is one of a drunken, abusive, neer-do-well, just the kind of guy who would die alone and unlamented.
  Negative

  Negative
Theyre generally not happy to hear his name mentioned.
  Negative
A woman who runs a seaside fish and chips shop, who was his girlfriend two decades before, recalls him as violent and impetuous.

  Negative
Shes grateful to May that hes let her know the sad news, but she doesnt want any further involvement with her fatheruntil she changes her mind and calls the messenger back, sparking a connection between two lonely people that propels the tales third act toward an ending in which sudden surprise is followed by a bit of magical-realist uplift.
  Negative
The films title says lots about its mood and style, which is heavy on becalmed views of rooms, objects like an apple peel and office utensils, and Mays glazed gazes at nothing in particular.
  Negative
Pasolini formerly a producer of films including The Big Monty says this approach is indebted to late Ozu, but its also one shared by many European art films of the downbeat-humanist sort.
  Negative
In terms of atmosphere, it conveys a kind of drab ordinariness that, for some reason, in English films, comes across as exceptionally dull, constricted and depressing.
  Negative
The nuanced particularity pays its best dividends in the exacting, flavorful performances, especially Marsans Mr. May, who has a face like a squashed grapefruit, with doleful eyes, a looming nose and a stretched mouth that only really smiles when he meets his last clients daughter.
  Positive
Whether filmgoers want to join his journey will be a matter of individual taste.
  Neutral
Though the films lachrymose gist is conveyed with subtlety and insight into the rigors of loneliness and mortality, it is lachrymose nonetheless.
  Negative
Fans of Eleanor Rigby, in any case, should not miss it.
