A  comedy with no laughs.
  Negative
A drama disconnected from any known reality.
  Neutral
Its tempting to diagnose Are You Here with schizophrenic genre  disorder.
  Negative
But that just sounds like an excuse to cover up what it  really is, an unmitigated mess that feels the need to present yet more  iterations of that tired Hollywood species known as man-child  run-amok-ous.
  Negative
Sometimes  it tries to be a  Broadcast News-style comedy, with  Owen Wilson as the  type of smarmy philandering moocher he has done countless times before.
  Negative
The difference here is that he is a local TV weatherman in Annapolis,  Md., who makes  Bill Murrays on-air forecaster in  Groundhog Day seem  like a paragon of repeated virtue.
  Negative
Wilsons  Steve Dallas is a regular one-man rodeo all right full of bull and  proud of it.
  Positive
He has a constant need to have a potential bed partner at  the ready at all time be it co-worker, casual pickup or prostitute.
  Negative
He  also has a propensity to peep at his shapely across-the-way neighbor as  she disrobes in front of her windows each night, and not in a Jimmy  Stewart non-creepy way.
  Negative
Then there is his charming habit of pretending  to be able to pay the bill with his worthless credit cards and his  constant use of mind-altering substances even on the job.
  Neutral
Other  times, Are You Here appears to be a portrait of a dysfunctional  family in the vein of  August: Osage County when Steves best and  seemingly only friend, Ben, learns that his father has died and the  funeral requires a road trip to rural Pennsylvania.
  Negative
To mention that this  hirsute near-hermit, manic-depressive idealist and fellow pothead  residing in a mobile shack whose interior decorator was obviously the  Unabomber is played by  Zach Galifianakis is akin to stating the  obvious.
  Negative
There  is even a hint of  Witness, as Amish folk occasionally materialize and  then quickly take their leave in a possible attempt to add some  existential folksiness to the over-reaching muddle that unfolds  onscreen.
  Negative
An enveloping plot of sorts exists, one that involves the ever-popular contested last will and testament, but it struggles to tie the overload of random themes together.
  Positive
The  most astonishing fact about Are You Here is not the casual insertion  of a pseudo-incestuous sex scene that no sane person would ever want to  see.
  Negative
Nor that there is an actual chicken running around with its head  cut off at some point.
  Neutral
Or even that a talent so above this enterprise as   Amy Poehler agreed to play Bens sister, a miserable shrew defined by  her harsh eyeliner and seething dissatisfaction tied to her  inability to have children.
  Neutral
No,  the most shocking thing is that  Matthew Weiner is the perpetrator  behind this sad enterprise.
  Neutral
It took the much-lauded creator of TVs Mad  Men and invaluable contributor to The Sopranos eight years to bring  this foolhardy venture to theaters.
  Neutral
Are You Here is not his actual  feature debut that would be a tiny  effort titled What Do You Do  All Day?
  Negative
but its the first to see the light of day.
  Positive
As a frustrated  would-be movie director, it feels as if hes dumped every brainstorm he  ever had on the screen, including a prominent farmhouse kitchen sink,  with little desire for self-editing.
  Negative
And  shame on the man behind such complex female characters as Peggy Olson,  Joan Harris and Sally Draper for inventing such a passive creature of  desire as Angela  Laura Ramsey, who appeared in Mad Mens  The Jet  Set episode, Ben and Terris impossibly young, earth-mama stepmother  who swans about in filmy white ensembles even though she lives and works  on a farm.
  Negative
She exists only to fulfill the fantasies of men, including  Wilson, Ben and his father, who felt compelled to provide extensive  nausea-inducing details of their sexual history in his will.
  Neutral
I  have to give credit to Weiner for one achievement: He makes some sharp  casting choices among his supporting ranks.
  Positive
He has obviously watched  series other than his own, considering that he is smart enough to hire  Paul Schulze, so good as pharmacist Eddie on Nurse Jackie, as Wilsons  boss and  Lauren Lapkus, the female prison guard Suzanne on Orange Is  the New Black, as his fawning co-worker.
  Positive
But if Matthew Weiner werent  Matthew Weiner, there would be no way this script would attract the  likes of director  Peter Bogdanovich who also did The Sopranos as a  judge and  Edward Herrmann as Bens therapist or convince  Jenna Fischer  of The Office to show up in the final  minutes or so in a nothing  role.
  Negative
Maybe  Weiner deserved this chance.
  Neutral
Maybe he has gotten it out of his system.
  Neutral
But maybe he should be more concerned about putting together a  satisfying finale for Mad Men next spring he already told Rolling  Stone he is anticipating mixed reviews rather than tilting at such a  flimsy windmill of a movie.
  Negative
