I can do this.
  Positive
I'm okay."
  Neutral
Vanessa Hudgens, fully separated now from her "High School Musical" persona, having taken gritty almost feral roles in "Sucker Punch," " Spring Breakers," and "Frozen Ground", stands in a cramped bathroom, chopping off her black hair, whispering those words to herself.
  Very negative
Her words will come up again as her character, Apple, makes a run for it, out of the life handed to her, into a life she created.

  Negative
The scenes of Apple in the shelter all the other pregnant girls are the film's best, but the shelter doesn't appear until halfway through, Krauss having decided for some reason to hold it back.
  Negative
What this does is it makes the shelter seem like a sub-plot, or another "and then this happened" episode, when it is actually the point of the whole thing.

Aside from James Earl Jones and a baffled and uptight  Brendan Fraser, Vanessa Hudgens is the only "name" in the film.

Her mother, played by an almost-unrecognizable  Rosario Dawson, was "born in the streets", she has rotting yellow teeth, bruises on her legs.

The "system" keeps trying to re-unite Apple with her mother, against Apple's clear wishes.
  Negative
But Apple is still a minor.

In the opening scenes of the film, Apple escapes from her mother's clutches and makes her way to New Jersey to track down the man who is her biological father Brendan Fraser, a man she has never met.

  Positive
She has a sense of mission towards the unborn babies under her care, as well as to the girls who live in her house.
  Positive
The girls in these scenes are wonderful, anonymous, they seem to have stepped right off the streets.
  Positive
Their interactions feel improvisational and fresh.While there is some bickering, none of it gets too harsh.
  Very negative
For the most part it is a supportive family atmosphere.
  Negative
The couple of scenes between Dawson and Hudgens vibrate with pain and ugliness.
  Negative
The script is often obvious, with all feelings laid out too cleanly, but both actresses still manage to create a jagged relationship based on their characters' codependence and shared traumas.
  Negative
One of the film's strengths is its portrayal of the "system" and what it does to abused children, and the layers of bureaucracy that make it hard to bring about meaningful change in people's lives.
  Positive
There's a reason the Christian media has been following this film closely.
  Negative
The religious aspect of "Gimme Shelter" is right out on the table, once the kindly priest shows up, but it's undercut by the grubby and warm reality of those girls in the shelter.
  Neutral
There are some scenes where the girls grumble to one another at being made to collect donations in local churches, and be trotted out as success stories of living in the light of Jesus.
  Negative
The film never says the words "pro-life" or "pro-choice."
  Neutral
It genuinely seems to be about how the system has broken down entirely, and how sometimes it is up to privately funded charities to provide a light at the end of the tunnel.
  Neutral
