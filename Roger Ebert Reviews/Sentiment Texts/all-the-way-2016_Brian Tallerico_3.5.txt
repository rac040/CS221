It is perhaps an appropriate election year to remind ourselves that change in this country takes blood, sweat and tears.
  Neutral
At a time when the nation feels more divided than ever, its healthy to look back at one of the turning points in the political system of the United States, a fight for civil rights that pushed the establishment so hard that it forever reshaped the electoral college.
  Negative
Think about this amazing fact: Before the Presidential election in , Georgia had never voted Republican.
  Neutral
They have done so in the last five elections.
  Neutral
The Republican South wasnt always so much of a given, and HBOs All the Way makes the case that a lot of this political shift started because Lyndon B. Johnson recognized the importance of civil rights when he ascended to the presidency after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, turning it into the election issue of that year and provoking the ire of a GOP establishment that wasnt on the right side of history.
  Positive
This excellent drama, carried by a truly incredible performance from Bryan Cranston, captures the difficulty of the political machine.
  Very positive
"All the Way" can be a little frustratingly thin, in that it tries to do a bit too much in  minutes, turning complex political figures into plot device characters ones who come into frame, serve their purpose for the protagonist, and exit stage right, but theres so much worthy of discussion in the piece that All the Way never drags.
  Negative
And Cranston should clear some more mantle space for a future Emmy and Golden Globe to sit next to the Tony he won for this role.
  Negative
Adapted from his play of the same name, writer Robert Schenkkan, working with director  Jay Roach, is careful not to make All the Way feel like a filmed play.
  Negative
A cinematic score by  James Newton Howard, and fluid, complex camera work by  Jim Denault help that effort, but its the engaging turn by Cranston that really magnifies the source material.
  Very positive
One can see why he was so praised on stage I never saw the play as he embodies Johnson, diving into both his outlandish behavior having meetings while on the toilet and complex moral code.
  Negative
In many ways, it is everything that Cranstons performance in  Trumbo, also directed by Roach, was not.
  Positive
While that performance felt like a caricature, Johnson feels well-rounded and complex from minute one of All the Way.
  Positive
In that first minute, Johnson is on Air Force One, with a still-bloody Jackie Kennedy, after her husbands assassination.
  Positive
Hes going to take the Oath of Office to become the President of the United States.
  Negative
In his first speech as President, Johnson affirms that the Civil Rights bill his predecessor started will be his priority.
  Negative
Johnsons former mentor and friend Senator Richard Russell Jr. a perfect and understated  Frank Langella isnt too happy with this decision, but Hubert Humphrey  Bradley Whitford embraces the directive, positioning himself to be Johnsons Vice President in the upcoming election.
  Negative
Most of all, Martin Luther King Jr.
  Neutral
Anthony Mackie recognizes that he will have to work carefully with Johnson to get what his movement demands from the government.
  Negative
Concessions start quickly.
  Neutral
Johnson learns that unless he removes voting rights from the bill, it wont pass.
  Negative
From the beginning, Schenkkan and Roach are working with the very core of the political game in how they capture what Johnson knew was and was not possible.
  Positive
While some encourage him to fight for voting rights, he realizes that fair employment and making other discriminatory practices illegal this year is step one, and voting rights is next year.
  Negative
As J. Edgar Hoover a cartoonish  Stephen Root spies on King to try to get dirt and Lady Bird Johnson  Melissa Leo stands by her husbands side, the political stew starts to boil.
  Negative
As the election season heats up, party lines are drawn and unexpected curveballs keep Johnson from an easy path to stay in the White House.
  Positive
Few films have better captured the unpredictability of the campaign season, such as when the murder of a civil rights activists derails his strategy or when the arrest of someone close to him nearly ruins everything.
  Negative
And its impossible not to read a bit of commentary into the current political season when Johnson mentions outside forces conquering and destroying the South by appealing to their racial hatred."
  Negative
It's a line that was either prescient to the racial divisions defining this campaign or written for the movie and not the play.
  Negative
While theres a lot to like in Schenkkan's smart script, All the Way is really a vehicle for Cranston, and he delivers in ways that make it much easier to forget Trumbo.
  Positive
This is such a nuanced take on a character who could be larger than life.
  Negative
Hes got the accent, the bloated ego and all the elements on to which other actors would hang the entire performance, but then he shades from there.
  Negative
Right from the beginning, when Johnson is questioning how seriously hell be taken as he steps into Kennedys shoes, this is an intricate acting turn thats more interested in character details than caricature.
  Positive
Mackie is good, though MLK plays more of a supporting role here than he arguably should have.
  Positive
But "All the Way" focuses on Johnsons role in the civil rights movement, not the story of civil rights on the ground in the South, as so deftly captured in Ava DuVernay's  Selma.
  Neutral
"All the Way" can be a crowded film, and roles like Hoover amp' Lady Bird arent designed to feel like more than sounding boards for Johnson.
  Negative
As with a lot of stage-to-screen productions, the background players sort of fade into a chorus, but whats there in the spotlight, center stage, isnt just a great performance but a formative chapter in our history' one thats still to be written.
  Positive
