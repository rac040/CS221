While "The Purge: Anarchy" is more thoughtful and involving than " The Purge," a misconceived B-thriller set in a dystopian near-future, it's not much better.
  Negative
While "The Purge" focused on a middle-to-upper class family's struggle to survive Purge Night, an annual government-sanctioned night of lawless debauchery, "The Purge: Anarchy" is about everyone else affected by this Bizarro, post- Roger Corman world.
  Negative
So, this time, characters acknowledge that The Purge encourages a free-for-all that disproprtionately affects profit-hungry blue collar sadists and closeted middle-class sociopaths more than cartoonishly callous socialites.
  Negative
But, just like its predecessor, "The Purge: Anarchy" is so weak on a basic storytelling level that it makes you want to nitpick everything about it, from characters' generically illogical decisions ex: Why are you running towards mounted guns?
  Negative
to its cheap-looking, jiggly hand-held cinematography.
  Negative
Somehow, the fact that writerdirector James DeMonaco is more ambitious with his sequel makes it that much more disappointing.
  Negative
"The Purge: Anarchy" follows a group of hapless stragglers as they look for safe haven on Purge Night.
  Negative
The only thing members of this group have in common: they do not want to die.
  Negative
Shane  Zach Gilford and girlfriend Liz  Kiele Sanchez are just as victimized as Tanya Justina Machado and mother Eva  Carmen Ejogo, though the latter couple was forcibly dragged from their home by would-be revelers.
  Negative
All four victims are united bySergeant  Frank Grillo, an indecisive, but basically good-natured Purge participant.
  Negative
Their lives before and after The Purge are pretty much immaterial.
  Neutral
Each person has a wisp of a backstory, but none of that really matters.
  Negative
Instead, "The Purge: Anarchy" focuses on Sergeant's group as they evade mask-wearing bikers, a  Bill Paxton lookalike, and evil rich people.
  Negative
The night is young, and everyone's out for blood.
  Negative
Everyone but DeMonaco, that is.
  Negative
He gives himself several opportunities to mock his more bloodthirsty characters, including blue-plate fund-raisers and amoral human traffickers.
  Negative
But none of these characters are really to blame.
  Negative
They're dupes, as is apparent by the way that almost all Purgers bless "the New Founding Fathers" for giving them the right to Purge.
  Negative
The only really capital-B Bad Purger is the gun-toting slob that tries to rape Eva and Tanya.
  Negative
You know he's black-hat bad because he roars about "releasing the beast," a phrase that a newscaster also uses when telling Purge people to enjoy themselves.
  Negative
That kind of prompt is indicative of how bland "The Purge: Anarchy" is.
  Negative
Several characters exist only to serve as nasty caricatures, particularly anyone rich enough to own formal-wear.
  Negative
And while you shouldn't expect a "Robocop"-level critique from DeMonaco, the screenwriter of the low-stakes  remake of " Assault on Precinct ," you should expect him to follow through on some of his more provocative ideas.
  Negative
Then again, while you can ignore how toothless "The Purge: Anarchy" is as an allegory, you can't escape the film's pervasive dreariness.
  Neutral
It's one thing to be grim, and another to be competently grim.
  Negative
DeMonaco's film is the former: characters are consistently poorly lit, action scenes are negligibly choreographed, and actors perform as if they know a second or third take is coming.
  Very negative
"The Purge: Anarchy" starts with a seemingly important subplot--Eva's father Rico  John Beasley is sick, and needs medicine badly--then drops it after that subplot becomes moot.
  Negative
It's the kind of drama where the death of one of the film's five major characters just sort of happens, and there are no real repercussions.
  Negative
DeMonaco's characters appear, gently stir the pot, then vanish.
  Positive
You won't remember them any time soon.
  Negative
More than anything, this speaks to DeMonaco's creative indecision.
  Positive
If he unclenched, and had a little fun developing the world his film is set in, "The Purge: Anarchy" might not be so tedious.
  Negative
It's as silly as " Logan's Run" and as angry as " The Last House on the Left" but its creator isn't confident enough to follow through on any of its superior ideas.
  Negative
There's a good movie to be made of "The Purge: Anarchy"'s raw materials.
  Positive
Here's hoping it doesn't take two more sequels to get there.
  Negative
