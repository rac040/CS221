After months of controversy and now a limited release in arthouse theaters and through VOD, The Interview is nothing new, but it looks great.
  Negative
Its widescreen visuals are James Bond" Mission: Impossible" chrome-plated sleekness.
  Positive
The camera glides, shakes and catches the occasional wispy anamorphic lens flare as characters flit through control rooms, conference rooms, hotel suites and grand chambers.
  Neutral
You expect  Kanye West and some X-Men to show up.
  Neutral
Its the visual approach filmmakers like  Edgar Wright and various cohorts of this films star,  Seth Rogen including its co-director,  Evan Goldberg, spent the past decade indulging, to give their flouncy bromantic comedies the sizzle and swagger of a good action-adventure.
  Negative
To make it worth the trouble and expense, you need more than just a tight story and vivid characters.
  Positive
You need performers who play it without a wink.
  Neutral
Rogens co-lead,  James Franco, takes a break from winking roughly one third of the time.
  Positive
Late in the film theres a ludicrous, emotional scene between Francos character, an American news personality-jackass, and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un  Randall Park, that reminds us what Franco can do when he gets serious and subtle.
  Negative
His palpable sorrow almost makes the weak East-West jokes pop.
  Negative
Early in the film, and for much of it, he is simply trying too hard.
  Negative
Imagine  James Dean aiming for  Will Ferrell speed and pitch.
  Neutral
In Francos relentless hyperactivity I sense immense fear, of not supplying enough energy to this gargantuan film, of not giving Rogen enough to volley back.
  Negative
Its as misguided as  Leonardo DiCaprios yelping lizard in  The Wolf of Wall Street.
  Negative
Seth Rogen, on the other hand, hangs out.
  Negative
The credits list him as a co-director and producer, but he wears none of the presumable stress of those duties in his performance.
  Negative
His naturalness serves the chatterbox dialogue a lot better than Francos general muppet approach.
  Positive
Francos manic newsman convinces his longtime producer Rogen to seek an interview with Kim Jong-un after learning that their talk show is the supreme leaders favorite.
  Negative
Before they can seal the deal, the CIA recruits them to poison Kim during their North Korea visit.
  Negative
Trouble is, Kim ends up showing a human side very different from the Wests image of an infantile, eccentric tyrant.
  Negative
Could Kim be, deep down, just a cool geek, an American slacker at heart?
  Positive
I didnt laugh once, but there were several lines that, in context, got a wide fool-grin out of me.
  Neutral
Here are a few: Shes not honeypotting you and Im not honeydicking him.
  Negative
A tiger has night vision goggles?
  Neutral
Welcome to the jungle, baby, welcome to the jungle.
  Neutral
Na na na knees.
  Neutral
McConaughey goat f--k!
  Neutral
A few other smirky lines related to the coming-out of a famous rapper on Francos trashy TV show prepare us for an average of one homosexual panic andor homoerotic joke per scene--standard ratio for the Rogen genre.
  Negative
The rappers deadpan actually saves the confession scene from Francos Jiminy Glick-wannabe preening.
  Negative
Opportunities at rich satire flatten out into Hangover dude-dope-doodoo jokes, where the premise is that theres nothing funnier than watching over-privileged grown men act out middle school id worldwide, except for the spectacle of foreigners catching the Ugly American bug, too.
  Negative
They hate us cuz they aint us is Rogens dismissal of his shows critics, and that philosophy extends to this films worldview.
  Negative
Those that dont hate us are simply in awe, like the adorable North Korean official  Diana Bang who cant keep her hands off Rogen.
  Positive
She is liberated in his bed and, later, at his side, gunning down her countrymen.
  Negative
But, again, thats nothing new.
  Negative
Everybody from Hope amp' Crosby to Eddie Golden Child Murphy to Ben  Tropic Thunder Stiller have used the worlds exotic locales to riff on American insularity without challenging it.
  Negative
Cute, but the question is, when will this formula get as old to popular filmmakers as it is to those of us who sense the complacency it encourages in a world that churns blithe dehumanization into the stuff dictators and profiteers thrive on?
  Negative
