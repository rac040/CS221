There are moments of tenderness and honest human emotion buried in the frustrating A Long Way Down but one has to work far too hard and give far too much credit to the over-qualified cast to grab at them.
  Negative
Based on a hit book by  Nick Hornby  High Fidelity,  About a Boy that contained an emotional minefield maudlin enough that the film took nearly a decade to come into existence even though the Hornby bandwagon was full in the s, A Long Way Down is a textbook case of over-direction.
  Negative
Characters laugh too hard' the score by Dario Marianelli alternates between wispy guitar strumming and heartstring-pulling piano tinkling' the suicidal characters literally dance to I Will Survive at one point.

A Long Way Down is a film thats afraid of its subject matter: suicidal depression.
  Negative
One never senses any actual danger or urgency in the plight of these characters to battle their demons before they kill them, and the lack of any sense that these people might actually end their lives drains the piece of drama.
  Very negative
Their depression is merely a plot device.

  Positive
Jess lying on her bed singing the BeeGees classic Tragedy should be done with a wink, not with a treacly score underneath.

It sounds picky, I know, but A Long Way Down never registers emotionally because it is constantly reminding you its a movie.

And its not a very good one.
