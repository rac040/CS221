The plot of Glass Chin is familiar: A down-on-his-luck former boxer named Bud  The Saint Gordon  Corey Stoll works as an enforcer for local New Jersey gangster J.J.  Billy Crudup.
  Negative
Bud spends his nights visiting J.J.s loansharking victims, and his days training a young welterweight named Kid Sunshine Malcolm Xavier.
  Negative
When Buds enforcer colleague Roberto Yul Vasquez kills a man during a shakedown, J.J. frames Bud for the crime.
  Negative
Unless Bud can convince Kid Sunshine to throw the fight, J.J. will release to the cops footage of Bud entering the victims apartment, incriminating him in the crime.
  Negative
Caught between a rock and a hard place, Bud makes a series of bad decisions that may lead to his downfall.
  Negative
My description may have conjured up several movies in your mind, movies about dive-taking boxers or low-level criminals undone by their own stupidity.
  Negative
There really is nothing new under the Sun, especially in the realm of neo-noirish flights of fancy like this.
  Negative
But the true measure of a good tale is in the telling, and writer-director  Noah Buschel spins his yarn in an unexpected, ultimately satisfying fashion.
  Very positive
This is a boxing movie without a scene of the climactic match, a murder movie with no onscreen violence and a character study where people discuss philosophical quandaries on a whim.
  Negative
It is extremely talky, sometimes to its own detriment, and the first  minutes or so may prove too off-putting for the casual viewer.
  Very negative
I admit the directors vision took some getting used to, with its long takes and penchant for framing characters looking at the camera while talking to someone off-screen.
  Negative
However, once I acclimated to Buschels rhythms and became invested in the all-around solid acting by the cast, I found much to enjoy.
  Neutral
Part of the fun came from realizing how subtly Buschel plays the required notes in stories like this, and how strangely he plays them.
  Positive
For example, the lead characters motivations hinge on his desire to reopen a restaurant closed by his boss and tormentor.
  Positive
Considering the outcome of Glass Chin, it must have been a damn good restaurant.
  Negative
Bud does not live up to his saintly boxing moniker.
  Negative
Hes cheating on his live-in girlfriend Ellen  Marin Ireland and, as Ellen points out in the films best monologue, The Saint hasnt been very good to her.
  Positive
In many scenes, hes verbally abusive, though Ellen gives as good as she gets.
  Positive
We also see Bud insulting a homeless man who recognizes Bud from his failed boxing career, a career that the film hints was derailed by Bud taking more than one dive.
  Negative
Bud doesnt want Ellen to work, and the lack of anyone bringing in a steady income influences the unwise choices Bud makes.
  Negative
Yet, Glass Chin isnt as dismissive of Bud as it feels on first blush.
  Negative
Late in the film, Stoll and Ireland play a quiet, beautifully rendered scene of naked vulnerability.
  Positive
The stresses of Buds choices take their toll on him, and he breaks down in Ellens arms in the shower.
  Negative
The scene is completely unexpected, framed in such a way that it looks as If the walls are literally closing in on them.
  Positive
Buschels script concerns itself with the rambling dialogue his characters utter to pass the time, but his direction does all the storytelling.
  Negative
Some very good acting distracts from the film's less successful patches.
  Negative
The always-welcome  Kelly Lynch makes the most of her few scenes as Mae, a bartender with whom Bud has a past and current sexual history.
  Negative
New York Dolls  David Johansen has an effective cameo that evokes memories of his turn in the Cat from Hell section of Tales from the Darkside: The Movie.
  Positive
Crudup is quietly menacing as J.J., a mobster whose art galleryownership seems completely at odds with the less-refined tastes one expects from this type of character.
  Negative
And Stoll is excellent at capturing the essence of a broken-down palooka' he physically wears the weight of the world on his shoulders, adding a few extra pounds because he knows many of his problems are self-inflicted.
  Positive
Bud is not likable, and at times hes just plum stupid, but Stoll makes you care enough to keep watching him.
  Negative
I dont think Glass Chins last reel thesis on how the rich manipulate the poor is convincing, but I admired that Buschel gave Roberto the chance to broach the idea.
  Negative
I also liked the inconclusiveness of the films last scene.
  Positive
Is Buds last line referring to an act of defiance or desperation?
  Neutral
Glass Chin becomes far more interesting upon reflection, which isnt a bad thing if youcan get on its wavelength.
  Negative
