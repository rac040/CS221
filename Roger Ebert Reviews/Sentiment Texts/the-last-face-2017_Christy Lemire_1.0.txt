Sean Penn turns African strife into a two-hour perfume commercial with The Last Face, veering between gauzy impressionism and shrieky melodrama with his latest directorial effort.
  Negative
Penns own humanitarian work is well-documented, including raising millions of dollars for Haitian relief efforts.
  Negative
Clearly, his intentions here are genuine.
  Positive
But his execution is laughably pretentious, crammed as it is with dramatic lighting, repeated use of artful slow motion and wailing vocals, including some from longtime pal Eddie Vedder.
  Negative
The Last Face shines a light on the plight of war-torn lands like Liberia and South Sudan, a topic most moviegoers probably dont want to think about.
  Negative
Its too far away, too daunting, too unpleasant.
  Very negative
But Penn ultimately fetishizes such suffering, making it self-consciously beautiful through hand-held camerawork, off-kilter angles, extreme close-ups of eyes and fingers and glittering lens flares.
  Negative
Meanwhile, the Africans themselves fade into the background, rendered less as individuals than types: proud fathers, strong mothers and adorable children, all photogenic.
  Negative
Because the real story at the films center is a romance between gorgeous people with big hearts and a taste for danger:  Charlize Theron as the determined director of an international aid agency and  Javier Bardem as a roguish, globetrotting doctor.
  Positive
Erin Dignams script hops around in time and place, tracing the couples star-crossed courtship over the course of a decade and various countries.
  Negative
But while Theron is saddled with breathy narration spelling out how she feels about everything, all the time Before I met Miguel, I was an idea I had.
  Negative
I didnt really exist., the film as a whole doesnt seem particularly interested in examining why this region of the world is ravaged.
  Negative
Instead, we get a close-up of Bardems Dr. Miguel Leon washing his filthy feet in a sink, which dissolves into a slow-motion shot of a helicopter flying over a devastated refugee camp.
  Negative
As Dr. Wren Petersen, Theron appears at the films start on stage at a glitzy charity dinner, appealing to wealthy donors in a slinky black dress.
  Negative
Then the film cuts abruptly to the events of  days earlier: gun fighting and carnage, with a blood-soaked Miguel tending to victims who were caught in the crossfire.
  Negative
Despite Wrens frequent, hand-holding voiceover, the storys many temporal leaps often result in confusion.
  Negative
Eventually, we see how the two fell in love back in , flirting with each other at a Sierra Leone refugee camp with giggly tooth brushing serving as foreplay.
  Negative
Are you a playboy, Miguel?
  Negative
Wren asks playfully.
  Negative
And then its back to the artful squalor.
  Negative
But the core of The Last Face is, ostensibly, a mystery: What happened to this couple who fell in love quickly, passionately and ill-advisedly?
  Negative
What tore them apart, leaving Wren lying in bed with depression for three days but still looking stylishly tousled?
  Negative
And, more crucially, can you bring yourself to care?
  Negative
The rift may have something to do with the fact that Wren used to toil away in the trenches and is now buttoned-down in the boardroom.
  Negative
Saving lives is a serious mission, she tells members of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva and us, as well, as if we didnt know.
  Negative
To reinforce that point, Penns imagery can indeed be harrowing: a pile of bloody boys bodies with flies buzzing all about them or a woman who lost her legs at the knees, lying in a cot, asking whether her daughter survived.
  Negative
But even during the films most stressful moments including, most awkwardly, an emergency C-section in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night The Last Face finds a way to wedge in a sense of romance.
  Negative
And a potential subplot involving Adele Exarchopoulos as a longtime aid worker whose history is entwined with both Wrens and Miguels feels half-baked.
  Negative
Ultimately, at the end of this overlong slog, The Last Face returns to the fancy fundraiser where it began.
  Negative
Wren tearfully tells the well-heeled crowd about refugees, They are us, and their dreams are as fundamental as breathing air.
  Positive
Then she strides off stage to the feel-good strains of Peace Train.
  Negative
In this moment, Theron reminds us who she is: a glamorous movie star.
  Positive
It's one final, glaring example of the film's unfortunate penchant for style over substance.
  Negative
