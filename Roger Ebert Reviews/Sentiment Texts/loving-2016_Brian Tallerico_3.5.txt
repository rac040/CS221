Jeff Nichols Loving is that rare mainstream film that provokes frustration and rage without resorting to monologues or melodrama.
  Negative
The two people at the center of this period drama arent prone to long speeches.
  Negative
Theyre quiet, conservative, almost shy folk who ended up at the center of one of the most important Supreme Court cases of the s by virtue of falling in love, getting married and having children.
  Neutral
Nichols approach is careful, reserved and deeply considerate of the human story hes trying to tell.
  Positive
Theres no sense of exploitation here if anything, hes almost too reverential in his unwillingness to show any flaws.
  Negative
One can sense a directors understandable trepidation in telling the story of two private people whose life was made very public.
  Positive
Whats most important to Nichols vision is how much trust he has in his two leads, and what they give back to him in exchange for that trust.
  Positive
In  Virginia, a reserved mechanic and construction worker named Richard Loving  Joel Edgerton married his pregnant girlfriend Mildred  Ruth Negga.
  Negative
The two drove to Washington, D.C. to make their union official, and Richard bought an acre of land near Mildreds family home on which he planned to build a house.
  Positive
They hoped that Richards mother would deliver their first child, and that they would live in peace in a beautiful, country setting.
  Positive
In the middle of the night, all of that changed.
  Neutral
Officers broke into their home, arresting both Richard and Mildred, stating that their marriage license was no good in Virginia and that they had violated anti-miscegenation laws that stated that mixed-race couples were a violation punishable by jail time.
  Negative
With the assistance of a local attorney  Bill Camp, the Lovings were released under one condition: they had to leave the state of Virginia and not return for  years.
  Negative
They had to leave their families, their land, the home that they wanted to build, and the future they had seen for themselves.
  Positive
As the world changed with the rise of the civil rights movement, an opportunity arose to use the Lovings' case to finally eliminate the racist laws still destroying lives in part of the country.
  Negative
From the opening scenes, theres a tactile, lived-in quality to Nichols filmmaking.
  Negative
People are always doing something with their hands cleaning a kitchen, laying brick for a house, working on a car, etc.
  Negative
And theres always something in the air, from the sound of crickets to the palpable heat of the Virginia summer.
  Positive
Nothing here feels like a backlot.
  Negative
The production design and direction is so beautifully detailed that people will take it for granted.
  Very positive
The Loving home, the cars he works on, the jail cells in which they spend the night, etc. every element has been carefully considered but not overly highlighted.
  Negative
It is a masterful example of how to use time and place in a film without drawing attention to it as so many award season movies tend to do.
  Very positive
Theres nothing flashy here.
  Negative
And that filmmaking aesthetic applies to the performances as well, two of the best acting turns youll see this year.
  Positive
Edgerton, long a fascinating actor, has never been better than he is here, especially as the weight of his situation almost looks like its physically pushing him down.
  Positive
His eyes are squinty, his posture bent from hard labor and the concern over the well-being of his wife and family.
  Negative
As the Loving case became more high-profile, Richard Loving had to live with constant fear and the realization that his family was arguably safer if he would just leave them.
  Negative
Rarely has the oppressive, every-minute-of-every-day atmosphere of the impact of racism been captured as it is here.
  Negative
It is like the dust in the air or the crickets at night always there.
  Negative
As phenomenal as Edgerton is here, its arguably Neggas movie.
  Positive
Its her eyes that I will remember, conveying so much inner monologue with just a downward glance or adoring look at her husband.
  Neutral
Theres a scene in which Mildred gets some surprising and good news via a phone call and Nichols knows two things.
  Positive
One, he knows that he shouldnt give Mildred an exclamation or a monologue.
  Positive
Two, he knows not to leave Neggas face.
  Neutral
Her eyes say so much more than dialogue possibly could in this situation.
  Negative
And that speaks to Nichols gifts as a filmmaker: one who understands how to use the tools at his disposal more than just writing expository dialogue.
  Positive
We see films every day in which people openly convey how they feel and what they want in ways that dont reflect the human experience.
  Positive
And yet theres more reflected about what it means to be a human being in Neggas eyes than anything Ive seen on film in a long time.
  Positive
Its a complex, subtle, quiet performance that gains its power through its believability more than the showiness weve come to expect in films like this one.
  Positive
Loving has few twists and turns.
  Positive
It is a rather straightforward drama, and therefore probably wont be flashy enough for some viewers.
  Negative
And yet it feels urgent and current to todays drama.
  Negative
Why do some films set a half-century ago feel like history lessons while others feel essential to not just the s but the s?
  Negative
Because theres truth in the story of Richard and Mildred Loving.
  Positive
Theres something about people who just want to be allowed to start a family that is timeless and always will be.
  Neutral
And it takes an incredibly talented trio of people in Nichols, Negga and Edgerton to convey that timelessness in a way that feels genuine.
  Positive
When Loving ends, one doesnt feel like they spent time being manipulated by awards bait or melodrama.
  Negative
One appreciates a story well-told and having been allowed a brief, believable window into the lives of Richard and Mildred Loving, two people who changed the country just by falling in love.
