Ever since  William Moulton Marston created her in ,Wonder Woman has always been at her best when her stories lean into the feminist ethos at her core.
  Positive
When artists treat her compassion as the key to understanding her rather than her brutality in battle audiences are privy to a superhero who offers what no other can: a power fantasy that privileges the interiority and desires of women.
  Positive
But film rarely has made room for the fantasies of women on such a grand scale.
  Negative
And in comic adaptations, women can be tough, funny, and self-assured.
  Positive
But rarely are they the architects of their own destiny.
  Negative
As a longtime Wonder Woman fan, I worried her distinctive edges would be sanded off when it came time for her standalone film.
  Negative
Its arguably easier to sell Wonder Woman as a vengeful heroine in the vein of countless others, but less distinctive.
  Neutral
But early in the film I noticed the terrain that director  Patty Jenkins turned to most often in order to create the emotional through-line.
  Negative
It wasnt the glimmer of a blade or even the picturesque shores of Themyscira, the utopian paradise Wonder Woman calls home.
  Negative
Through moments of quiet verisimilitude and blistering action sequences, Jenkins gaze often wisely returns to the face of her lead heroine, Diana  Gal Gadot.
  Positive
At times, her face is inquisitive, morose, and marked by fury.
  Positive
But more often than not she wears a bright, open smile that carries the optimism and hope that is true to the characters long history as well as a much-needed salve from what other blockbusters offer.
  Positive
In turn, Wonder Woman isnt just a good superhero film.
  Positive
It is a sincerely good film in which no qualifiers are needed.
  Positive
Its inspiring, evocative, and, unfortunately, a bit infuriating for the chances it doesnt take.
  Positive
Written by  Allan Heinberg, with a story also by  Zack Snyder and  Jason Fuchs, the story uses a variety of inspiration culled from Wonder Womans -year history.
  Negative
As a young girl, Diana enjoys the loving protection of the Amazons of Themyscira, a secluded island paradise created by the gods of Olympus.
  Positive
No Amazon is fiercer or more protective than her mother, Queen Hippolyta  Connie Nielsen.
  Negative
But Diana longs to be trained in the art of war by her aunt, Antiope a stellar  Robin Wright.
  Negative
She grows from a kind, young girl into an inquisitive, brave, young woman who never hesitates to helps those in need.
  Positive
Even a man like Captain Steve Trevor an endlessly charming  Chris Pine, who brings news of World War I when he crash-lands on the island disrupting this all-female sanctuary, gets saved by her.
  Negative
Diana leaves behind the only life shes ever known, heading to late s London to stop the war she believes is influenced by the god Ares.
  Negative
Cinematographer  Matthew Jensen, production designer  Aline Bonetto, and costume designer  Lindy Hemming form Themyscira into a gorgeous utopia that utilizes a variety of cultural touchstones.
  Very positive
Its free of the Hellenic influence youd expect from a story that takes such inspiration from Greek myth with the Amazons creating their home in a way that respects the lush nature around them rather than destroying it.
  Neutral
It isnt sterile either.
  Neutral
The scenes set in Themyscira have a dazzling array of colors including the gold of armor, the cerulean blue of the sea that surrounds them, warm creams, and deep browns.
  Positive
Jenkins films many of these scenes in wide shot, reveling in the majestic nature of this culture.
  Positive
Similarly, the history of the Amazons, told in a dense but beautifully rendered backstory by Hippolyta, evokes a painterly quality reminiscent of Caravaggio.
  Positive
Having said that, while Wonder Woman has a lot to offer visually, what makes this film so captivating is Gal Gadot and Chris Pine.
  Positive
Gadot wonderfully inhabits the mix of curiosity, sincerity, badassery, and compassion that has undergirded Wonder Woman since the beginning.
  Positive
Most importantly, she wears her suit, the suit doesnt wear her.
  Negative
She evokes a classic heroism that is a breath of fresh air and nods to  Christopher Reeves approach to Superman from the s. Likewise, Pine matches her hopefulness with a world weariness and sharp sense of humor.
  Positive
Hes more than capable at bringing an emotional complexity to a character most aptly described as a dude-in-distress.
  Positive
There are particularly great scenes at the beginning, as Diana talks about men being unnecessary for female pleasure.
  Positive
Steve seems undone by her presence, which makes the development of their story authentic.
  Negative
Their chemistry is electrifying, making Wonder Woman a successful romance and superhero origin story set during one of the most brutal wars.
  Very positive
At their best, blockbusters evoke awe that can be both humbling and thrilling.
  Positive
Think of the first time you saw the T-Rex in  Jurassic Park or the suspense that suffuses all of " Aliens."
  Neutral
Wonder Woman excels at this particularly in the earliest chapter set in Themyscira.
  Positive
I felt my heart swell watching Antiope smirk during an intense fight and Hippolytas tender scenes with Diana.
  Positive
Wonder Woman is like nothing that has come before it in how it joyously displays the camaraderie among women, many of whom are women of color and over .
  Negative
It's electrifying watching the Amazons train and talk with each other.
  Positive
These women are fierce and kind, loyal and brave.
  Very positive
If anything, I wished the film dwelt in Themyscira a bit longer, since their culture is so poignantly rendered.
  Negative
Also, it was just awesome to see Artemis Ann J. Wolfe and Antiope in battle.
  Negative
Elsewhere, the supporting cast is uneven.
  Negative
The villains an obsessive German General Ludendorff  Danny Huston and the mad scientist Doctor Maru nicknamed Doctor Poison  Elena Anaya are painted too broadly and given too few details to have a lasting impact.
  Negative
Dianas comrades that Steve rounds up are similarly crafted with little detail.
  Negative
Charlie  Ewen Bremner is a Scottish sharpshooter, ravaged by what hes witnessed in the war.
  Negative
Chief  Eugene Brave Rock is a Native American, capitalizing on the war for profit.
  Positive
Sameer  Sad Taghmaoui is a confidence artist of sorts.
  Positive
But the actors are able to give these characters enough sincerity and wit to make their appearances memorable.
  Positive
While Wonder Woman is an overall light, humorous and hopeful movie, it isnt afraid of touching on politics.
  Positive
The feminism of the film is sly.
  Positive
Its seen in moments when characters of color comment on their station in life and Diana faces sexism from powerful men who doubt her intelligence.
  Neutral
Of course, the feminism, charming performances, and delightful humor would be nothing without the direction by Patty Jenkins.
  Positive
Superhero films inherently carry the thrill of seeing these characters come to life and brandish great abilities, but far too often the fight scenes are neither epic nor engaging.
  Positive
So often theyre flatly lit, unimaginatively framed extravaganzas of characters fighting in airplane hangers and other drab surroundings.
  Negative
But what makes Wonder Woman so blistering is Jenkins distinctive gaze particularly in the fight scenes.
  Positive
Yes, the CGI is at times half-baked, which occasionally would snap me out of the momentum, but, overall, her voice as a director is so distinctive and her handling of the action so deft I was in complete awe.
  Positive
She shows off the great physicality of the Amazons, Diana's included, giving the action full room to breathe without being burdened by excessive editing or an over-reliance on close-ups.
  Positive
She treats action as a dance of sorts, with important characters having their own distinctive styles so that nothing ever feels repetitive.
  Negative
The sequences depicting Themyscira and Dianas first entry on the battlefield of World War I are particularly exemplary.
  Negative
Unfortunately, there are several choices that prevent the film from fully inhabiting the unique, feminist aims presented at the beginning.
  Negative
Ares, when hes finally introduced near the very end, at first seems to be a somewhat clever take on the God of War.
  Positive
He isnt so much seeking to end the world as create a new one by influencing the darkest aspects of mankind.
  Positive
But then the story tips into being a far more traditional superhero film than it had been previously.
  Negative
Its in the third act that the constraints of being part of an extended cinematic universe become apparent.
  Neutral
Its as if the last  minutes were cut from another film altogether that sought to create the bombastic, confusing, fiery sort of finale that far too many superhero works hew toward.
  Negative
The third act's approach to Dianas true origin creates a distinct schism between its sincere feminist aims and the desires of a company that often doesnt understand why people are drawn to this character in the first place.But there are enough moving touches like Dianas last scene with Steve that prevent the finale from weighing down the film entirely.
  Negative
Despite its flaws, Wonder Woman is beautiful, kindhearted, and buoyant in ways that make me eager to see it again.
  Positive
Jenkins and her collaborators have done what I thought was previously impossible: created a Wonder Woman film that is inspiring, blistering, and compassionate, in ways that honor what has made this character an icon.
  Very positive
