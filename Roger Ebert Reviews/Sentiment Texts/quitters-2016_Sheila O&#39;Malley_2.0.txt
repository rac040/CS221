It's not fun following teenage kid Clark  Ben Konigsberg around for an hour and a half.
  Negative
Clark is the lead character in Noah Pritzker's debut feature "Quitters" Pritzker co-wrote the script with  Ben Tarnoff, and he is manipulative, passive-aggressive, and a user with zero sense of humor.
  Very negative
Teenagers are often annoying, of course.
  Negative
And teenage angst and peer pressure and the newness of some experiences make them all act a little nuts.
  Negative
But Clark is a horse of a different color.
  Negative
Konigsberg, to his credit, does not soft-pedal any of Clark's personality flaws, a remarkable accomplishment for such a young actor.
  Negative
But, still, "Quitters" is a challenging and joyless experience.
  Negative
The title of the film is accurate.
  Positive
Everyone here quits: on themselves, on situations, doing drugs, staying in relationships.
  Negative
Considering his selfish parents, it's no wonder Clark has made an art out of bailing often with great cruelty when things get tough.
  Negative
Clark's mother  Mira Sorvino is in rehab for prescription-pill addiction.
  Negative
"Technically, your mother's not an addict.
  Negative
She has a 'dependency,'", says Clark's weak stoner dad, played by  Greg Germann.
  Negative
Clark has a crush on a classmate named Etta  Kara Hayward, and when she rebuffs his advances, he responds by dropping her as a friend via vicious condescending email, and then spreading rumors around school that she struggles with depression.
  Negative
Clark cannot stand his father, whom he treats with contemptuous superiority.
  Negative
Clark decides to quit his own awful family and become part of another.
  Negative
Crashing in the home of friend Natalia  Morgan Turner, he worms his way into the family's routines and, in a particularly bleak scene,into Natalia's bed.
  Negative
Saffron Burrows and  Scott Lawrence play the parents who welcome Clark into their home without once calling Clark's dad to see if it's okay.
  Positive
It calls to mind that funny line from " While You Were Sleeping": Lucy, you are born into a family.
  Positive
You do not join them like the Marines.
  Negative
To be fair, "Quitters" does not plead with us to sympathize with Clark.
  Negative
Pritzker and Tarnoff present him in a very straightforward way, showing us what he does, how he does it and his emotional brutality.
  Positive
"Quitters" also does not turn him into a case study his mother has a "dependency" and his dad's a loser, and that's why he's this way!
  Negative
Clark is smart, but he is also lazy.
  Neutral
He goes for what he wants, whether it's a condom he steals out of Natalia's mom's drawer, or challenging his teacher Mr. Becker  Kieran Culkin to give him a better grade.
  Negative
Sorvino is great in the small role of Clark's tear-stained, checked-out mother, calling and texting him desperately from rehab, but detached from any sense of real responsibility.
  Negative
Kieran Culkin is equal parts disturbing and endearing as the schlubby Mr. Becker, such a different role than the one he just played in Todd Solondz's " Wiener-Dog."
  Positive
Mr. Becker works on a novel in his off-hours, and seems like a big clueless kid himself, hanging out by the microwave, staring at it as it heats up his pizza.
  Neutral
He's tough on his students, but he's weak too.
  Negative
You can practically see the broken dreams scattered around his feet shuffling down the hallway.
  Negative
At a certain point, a pretty basic thought comes up: What exactly is the story being told here?
  Positive
The pedestrian style does not help.
  Negative
The scenes look like they're from a s TV movie, with little to no imagination or tension in the editing or angles.
  Negative
A beautiful piano theme by  David Shire is yearning, nostalgic, sweet, all qualities which do not enter into "Quitter"'s emotional landscape at all.
  Very positive
Fictional characters, even leads, don't need to be "relatable" or likable.
  Negative
They don't even need to be sympathetic.
  Negative
What they need to be is watchable, which Konigsberg is.
  Positive
Watching him operate he doesn't do it by stealth, he comes right out with it, is fascinating in a creepy way.
  Positive
He takes what he wants, walks away without blinking, and has no compunction about re-approaching people he's hurt if he then needs something from them.
  Neutral
His rear view mirror is filled with burned bridges already.
  Negative
He's a sociopath in training.
  Negative
Very few actors can be both opaque and revealing at the same time.
  Positive
Alain Delon can do it, but that's a pretty high bar.
  Positive
Konigsberg struggles a little bit in that department.
  Negative
There are times when the camera lingers on his face, and there is nothing going on' it is impossible to tell what he's thinking.
  Negative
And it's impossible to tell if that's the point.
  Negative
It may very well be.
  Positive
The teenage discontent and rage plus Clark's runaway status calls to mind Holden Caulfield in "Catcher in the Rye," but the comparison falls apart on closer examination.
  Negative
Holden had a sense of humor as well as at least being capable of intimate relationships with both of his siblings, dead and alive.
  Positive
Clark, following the example of his wretched parents, is already way beyond that.
  Negative
The more apt comparison would be Patricia Highsmith's Tom Ripley from her famous "Ripley" novels Alain Delon, incidentally, in all his gorgeous chilly cunning, played Tom Ripley in "Purple Noon ."
  Negative
Clark isn't as bad as Tom Ripley.
  Negative
Yet.
  Neutral
Maybe he'll turn out okay.
  Neutral
I doubt it, but maybe.
  Neutral
Maybe he's just surrounded byquitters, and he senses it, and he hates it.
  Negative
The film doesn't say.
  Negative
