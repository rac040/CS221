Though it takes place in a small town and involves only a handful of characters, the Russian drama Leviathan has a feeling of expansiveness, even grandeur.
  Positive
It opens with distant, monumental views of Russias north shore, where huge rock formations slope down into a churning, slate-gray sea, images set to a propulsive Phillip Glass score.
  Very negative
Soon we see the husks of abandoned sea-faring vessels along the waters edge, where, later in the film, well behold the enormous skeleton of a beached whale  a leviathan evoking both the Book of Job and Thomas Hobbes famous political tract.
  Negative
A prize winner at Cannes and Russias nominee for this years Best Foreign-Language Film Oscar, Leviathan is easily the most important and imposing film to emerge from Russia in recent years.
  Positive
Since its story conveys a sense of pervasive political corruption, it has been read as a daring and scathing critique of conditions in Vladimir Putins Russia, and it is certainly fascinating to contemplate on that level.
  Positive
Yet theres much more to writer-director  Andrey Zvyagintsevs singular artistic vision than simple political allegorizing, as the hypnotic opening of Leviathan makes clear.
  Positive
In a sense, the film takes us back to the first of Zvyagintsevs four features, The Return , which won the Golden Lion at Venice and became an international art-house hit.
  Very positive
Both movies feature dramatic landscapes that almost function as an additional character.
  Positive
Yet geographic specificity has no importance here' we never learn where either story takes place.
  Negative
The locales may seem vividly real, but for Zvaginstsev theyre primarily mythic  crucibles for dramas of the Russian soul.
  Positive
Both movies also feature Biblical references that have oblique political connotations.
  Negative
In The Return, about a gruff father who encounters his two teenage sons after an absence of  years, its the story of Abraham and Isaac, with the suggestion that the tale concerns the re-imposition of threatening paternalistic authority  years after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
  Negative
In Leviathan, the Book of Job references evoke timeless human suffering as well as the metaphysical questions it entails, while also pointing toward Hobbes notions of the freedoms that people surrender for the security of an authoritarian regime like Putins  a theme that obviously has implications for many countries besides Russia.
  Negative
The invocation of the mythic and the Biblical along with related historical, philosophical and political ideas should indicate that much of the drama in a Zvyagintsev film lies in wrestling with its multi-leveled potential meanings.
  Negative
The dramas themselves are usually fairly simple and emotionally direct, though each has a core of mystery and ambiguity that not only invites but compels our interpretative engagement.
  Positive
The main character in Leviathan, Kolya Alexey Serebryakov, lives and works on a small but desirable piece of waterside property that the local mayor, Vadim  Roman Madyanov, covets and has claimed for the town.
  Very positive
The story opens when an old army buddy of Kolyas whos now a slick Moscow lawyer, Dmitri Vladimir Vdovitchenkov, arrives to help him fight for his land.
  Negative
Though Kolya loses again in court, which seems under Vadims thumb, Dmitri then goes to the mayor and presents him with a sheaf of incriminating documents hes gathered.
  Very negative
Its blackmail of a sort but at first it seems to work.
  Neutral
Apoplectic, Vadim agrees to cut a deal.
  Negative
All of this happens in a context where theres lots of vodka drinking, argumentation and simmering discontent of various sorts.
  Negative
Kolyas moody teenage son by a previous marriage Sergey Pokhodaev cant get along with his current wife, Lilya  Elena Lyadova, a pensive beauty who works in a fishery.
  Negative
Introducing Dmitri into the home ups the chances for both bonhomie and trouble.
  Negative
Meanwhile we see the almost constantly drunken Vadim consorting with a well-groomed priest, who tries to allay his political fears with religious platitudes.
  Negative
The corrosive intertwining of politics and religion is a provocative theme in Leviathan.
  Positive
Thoroughly corrupt, Vadim belongs to a national hierarchy that, Zvyagintsev pointedly suggests, isnt much different from the Communist one it replaced: indeed, while a statue of Lenin still stands in front of the courthouse, a glowering portrait of Putin looms over Vadims office.
  Negative
Yet todays strongmen, rather than trying to eradicate religion, are bolstered by their mutually beneficial support of the Russian Orthodox Church.
  Negative
Still, though he includes a brief reference to Pussy Riot, it wouldnt be accurate to say that Zvyagintsev is anti-religious in any one-dimensional or atheistic sense.
  Negative
Like  Andrei Tarkovsky before him, hes a staunch anti-Communist who seeks to, in critic Oleg Sulkins words, draw support from the archetypally Russian intellectual and spiritual tradition that was trampled by the Bolshevik regime.
  Negative
Late in Leviathan, theres scene with a humble local priest who is portrayed as a sympathetic, spiritual counterpoint to the gilded, officious prelates we see in the films climactic scene, where current Russias perverse symbiosis of church and state is anatomized to devastating effect.
  Negative
Though the tone of most Zvyagintsev films might be described as brooding if not portentous, theres also a degree of wit to his approach here.
  Positive
In one of the films most memorable scenes, Dmitri joins Kolya, two male friends and their wives and kids for an outing to the country to shoot guns and drink vodka.
  Positive
After one of the men destroys all of the bottles theyve brought for target shooting with a blast of machine-gun fire, another produces an alternate set of targets  portraits of Soviet leaders from Lenin through Gorbachev.
  Negative
Asked if hes got any of subsequent Russian leaders, he jokes, Its too early for the current ones.
  Negative
While this scene contains another of the haunting landscapes that Zvyagintsev is so adept at conjuring, it also illustrates his particular visual mastery.
  Positive
Indeed those portraits are a characteristic instance of symbolic iconography' the director often pauses to gaze at such ambient images, whether old photos or fading religious murals.
  Positive
More characteristic still is his elegant choreography of subtle camera movements, muted natural lighting Michail Krichmans cinematography is precise and understated throughout and the comings and goings of several actors, all of them part of an ensemble thats uniformly excellent.
  Positive
Ultimately Leviathan may divide viewers between those who find its possible meanings too numerous and inchoate and others who welcome the challenges of helping create its meaning.
  Negative
Certainly, its prize-winning script can be faulted on a couple of levels: the motivations of Lilya, an important character, are left entirely opaque' and the attempt at a piercingly tragic conclusion doesnt quite come off.
  Negative
Yet the films ambitions are so grand and multi-dimensional, and mostly accomplished, that Zvyagintsevs audacity can only be applauded.
  Positive
His is a career that now must be counted one of the most significant in contemporary cinema.
  Positive
