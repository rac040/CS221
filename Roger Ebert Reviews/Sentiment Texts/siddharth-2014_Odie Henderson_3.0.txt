Mahendra Saini  Rajesh Tailang is a chain-wallah who peddles his zipper repair skills on the streets of Delhi.
  Negative
Armed with a megaphone, Mahendra markets himself to anyone within earshot.
  Positive
As with any service-oriented business, location is everything.
  Neutral
So when his usual beat stops being fruitful, Mahendras -year old son, Siddharth, is recruited to earn a second income.
  Negative
Mahendras brother-in-law, Ranjit  Anurag Arora suggests a trolley factory where child labor, though illegal, is a means of income.
  Negative
Siddharth travels to the factory unharmed, but two weeks before he is to return home, he disappears.
  Negative
Siddharth uses this story to comment on the state of abducted and runaway children in India.
  Neutral
It defies expectation by resisting the potentially exploitative aspects of its subject matter.
  Negative
Instead, director and co-writer  Richie Mehta focuses on the parental and societal response to Siddharths disappearance.
  Neutral
Mahendra sets out on an exhausting journey to find his son, and each person he encounters, from the police, to child services, to the factory manager who hired Siddharth, reacts in a nonchalant manner.
  Negative
Its as if the disappearance of a child has become so commonplace that it has lost its shock value and outrage.
  Negative
A sense of hopelessness invades every frame of Siddharth, yet its story is not emotionally manipulative.
  Negative
Those looking for the typical children-in-peril style mystery, one that ends with a standard resolution, will be dissatisfied.
  Neutral
It is clear early on that Siddharths disappearance will be used in service to a much bigger issue, and that we may never find out his whereabouts.
  Negative
As Mahendras search goes on, its sense of dramatic urgency is tempered by the realism of Mahendras financial situation.
  Negative
As much as hed like to drop everything to seek out his son, these monetary issues force a much slower call to action.
  Negative
As the film waits for Mahendra to earn enough money to buy a train or bus ticket to track down his latest lead, time mercilessly passes.
  Negative
Children missing longer than two days are very hard to find, one child services rep tells Mahendra.
  Negative
Your sons been gone two weeks.
  Neutral
When Mahendra files a report with his local police chief, she abruptly scolds him for his actions.
  Negative
You people never learn, she says.
  Negative
She lectures him on how far too many people opt to send their children to work illegally rather than put them in schools.
  Neutral
He was going to have to work sometime, Mahendra protests, though this is his pride speaking.
  Negative
Like so many others faced with this decision, he would rather have been the sole breadwinner in the family than farm out his kid.
  Negative
His economic situation forced his hand.
  Negative
To its detriment, Siddharth doesnt focus enough on the economic aspect of the problem.
  Negative
It does, however, explore how the Saini family dynamic is affected after their son disappears.
  Positive
Mahendras wife, Suman  Tannishtha Chatterjee, in a fine performance shows more outward emotion than her husband.
  Positive
She has a very good scene where she echoes the same commentary Mahendra heard from the police chief.
  Positive
She chides him for not being able to support his family, blaming him for their tragedy.
  Negative
When Mahendra points out that Suman supported sending Siddharth away, her retort speaks volumes about how much say she has in decision-making: I didnt approve.
  Negative
I remained silent.
  Neutral
In a seemingly more sinister context, Ranjit also remains silent.
  Negative
He knew about Siddharths disappearance far longer than Mahendra and Suman did.
  Negative
The factory owner, Om Prakash Amitabh Srivasta, reported to Ranjit that Siddharth ran away from the factory long before his work contract ended.
  Negative
That Ranjit doesnt report this, and his reasons for not doing so, are weak spots in the script.
  Very negative
An even bigger problem is the idea that, despite having cell phones, neither parent has a picture of their son.
  Negative
Whether a picture or a quicker response from Ranjit would have changed the final outcome remains unknown, though a large shadow of doubt is cast by Siddharths resolution.
  Negative
The film follows Mahendra on every lead he has while trying to find his son.
  Neutral
It takes him to the factory, where Siddharths roommate suggests a location hes heard missing children are found, and to that location in Mumbai.
  Negative
Rather than stoking suspense, Mehta uses these trips to provide information and social commentary.
  Negative
I wish the films tone were angrier while delivering its message, though I think the lack of outright anger is Mehtas point.
  Negative
More than once, the people Mahendra encounters express a cavalier attitude toward his missing kid You can always make another one, one person tells him, but others share his frustration.
  Negative
A social worker shows empathy, but ultimately laments were underfunded as it is, when Mahendra seeks her help.
  Negative
Tailing underplays his emotions sometimes too much but late in the film, hes very good at depicting scenes of Mahendras stress-fueled unraveling.
  Negative
The last few minutes of Siddharth find him engaging in two brutally honest conversations.
  Positive
The second is with Mahendras father, who provides a seemingly vicious though realistic piece of advice.
  Positive
The first conversation is with runaway Mumbai street kids who ask stinging yet pertinent questions before one nonchalantly states the sad truth that Mahendra may have to accept.
  Negative
Maybe Siddharth got lucky and left this world.
  Neutral
Siddharth leaves it up to the viewer to decide whether this lucky notion is a comfort or a tragedy.
  Negative
