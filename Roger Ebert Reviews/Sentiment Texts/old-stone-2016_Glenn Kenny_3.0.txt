Back when I was a young and feckless Jersey guy driving around with my friends, we had a running joke about how many points applied to mowing down some dope who was crossing against the light or jaywalking directly into your cars approaching fender.
  Negative
The more inappropriate or sacred the ostensible target, the higher the number of points.
  Negative
We did not make up this mordant joke at least I dont think we did.
  Negative
But we got a grim kick out of it, until we didnt.
  Negative
Mind you, we never actually hit anybody, or tried to!
  Positive
In contemporary urban China the value of a kill in a hit and run is not a joke, though.
  Negative
Hit and run accidents there are sickeningly common, and the consequences for the drivers who commit them vary in an equally sickening way.
  Negative
Its not a point system civilization hasnt devolved that badly.
  Negative
But a driver who kills someone in a hit and run accident gets, as a rule, very little in the way of punishment.
  Negative
Whereas a driver who merely injures someone has to pay costs of medical care for the remainder of the victims life.
  Negative
The way these peculiar rules practically affect human behavior is the subject of Old Stone," a concise but very knotty drama from director  Johnny Ma, a Chinese-born, Canadian-raised and U.S.-trained filmmaker making his feature debut.
  Negative
The title character, whose name in Mandarin is Lao Shi played in a superb and disciplined performance by Gang Chen is a cab driver in a small city in the Anhui province who hits a cyclist after a drunken passenger grabs his arm, causing him to swerve.
  Negative
As the victim lies on the pavement, foaming at the mouth, Old Stone makes calls, awaits help, and tries to follow the seemingly all-important procedure people keep mentioning and will continue to cite throughout.
  Negative
Sensing his victim may die, he takes the step of bringing him to the hospital himself.
  Negative
Thats when his troubles truly begin.
  Neutral
The victim is in a coma, and Old Stone has to pay the cost of his admission and care immediately.
  Negative
He then gets a hard time from everyone: the police, who want to know why he didnt follow, you guessed it, procedure"' his wife, whos afraid, not without reason, that the situation will bankrupt their family' a lawyer whos a family acquaintance, and so on.
  Negative
He eventually makes contact with the victims family.
  Negative
Turns out to be a bad idea.
  Negative
Old Stone manages to track down the drunk businessman who caused him to hit the victim in the first place.
  Neutral
The sunny grin of hope that lights up Old Stones face as he meets this man who he thinks can help him is the only time you see the character smile.
  Positive
Its a grimly heartbreaking sight, though, because you know this clown is going to bring him down and probably humiliate him while doing so.
  Very negative
People misuse the phrase Kafkaesque too often, but there is something like that in the dilemma Old Stone faces' actually, the situation is Kafkaesque in an inverted way.
  Negative
In Kafkas world, the characters are harassed, persecuted and killed for being themselves' here, Old Stone feels driven to harass, persecute and perhaps kill because of his circumstance.
  Negative
Writerdirector Ma handles the conundrums with brisk assurance, shooting the drama with a documentary realism that he punctuates with enigmatic views of forests undulating in the wind.
  Negative
By the movies finale, however, Ma overplays his hand.
  Negative
The ending, while not inapt, also delves into a realm of cinematic overstatement that the movie had up until that time been careful to avoid.
  Negative
While disappointing, it doesnt wholly mitigate the power of what has come before.
  Negative
This is an engrossing and unnerving film.
  Very positive
