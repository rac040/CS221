Over the past  years or so,  Francois Ozon has proven himself to be one of Frances most daring and audacious filmmakers through such works as See the Sea, "Under the Sand," "  Women,  Swimming Pool, Young and Beautiful and  The New Girlfriend.
  Positive
Even on those occasions when his work hasnt been up to snuff such as the odd period romantic drama Angel and the bizarre fantasy  Ricky, he at least had the grace to make them into interesting failures that showed his will to try different things.
  Positive
At first glance, his latest effort, Frantz, would seem to be just as daring based solely on the fact that it finds Ozon attempting to remake a film albeit a lesser-known one by a true legend of cinema, the great  Ernst Lubitsch.
  Negative
Unfortunately, Frantz is a film that displays precious little evidence of the distinctive touch of either Lubitsch or Ozon.
  Negative
While it is far from Ozons worst movie, it is perhaps the first one he's made that feels like it could be the work of any other director.
  Negative
Based on the  anti-war drama Broken Lullaby, itself inspired by a Maurice Rostand play whose title shall go unremarked here as it technically constitutes a spoiler, Frantz begins in the small German town of Quedlinburg just after the end of World War I and focuses on Anna  Paula Beer, still mourning the death of her fiance, Frantz Hoffmeister Anton von Lucke, on the battlefield a year earlier.
  Negative
One day, while visiting Frantzs grave, she discovers a mysterious Frenchman named Adrien  Pierre Niney has been paying his respects as well.
  Negative
Anna confronts Adrien, who tells her that he and Frantz were friends in Paris before the war.
  Neutral
Delighted by this, she brings Adrien back to the home that she shares with Frantzs parents, Hans  Ernst Sttzner and Magda  Marie Gruber, so that they can meet him.
  Negative
At first, Hans rejects the idea of meeting him, but a thaw begins to develop, and the Hoffmeisters welcome Adrien into their home so that he can regale them with tales involving him and Frantz in Paris before the war.
  Positive
Something also seems to be slowly developing between Adrien and Anna as well.
  Negative
While the Hoffmeisters are perfectly happy with this, fully recognizing the need for her to get on with her life, others in town are not quite as forgiving, especially Kreutz Johann von Bulow, who has been pressing Anna hard to marry him despite her utter lack of interest.
  Negative
He is also appalled by the prospect of losing her hand to anyone else, let alone a Frenchman.
  Negative
It is only a matter of time before the other shoe drops and Adrien abruptly returns to France after revealing some shocking news.
  Positive
Anna impulsively decides to follow him and as she searches the places that Adrien mentioned in his tales of him and Frantz in the hopes of tracking him down, she makes some additional discoveries about him.
  Neutral
More directly, she finds herself trying to discover whether she sees Adrien as just a substitute for her dead Frantz or as the beginning of a new and unexpected chapter in her own life.
  Negative
When Lubitsch told this story back in , World War I had been over for only  years and therefore no doubt resonated strongly with audiences still bearing the physical and emotional scars of that conflict.
  Negative
Although the underlying warnings about the horrors of war and the perils of blind nationalism will always be relevant, there is an inevitable lack of urgency to the basic narrative that Ozon is never quite able to overcome.
  Negative
For example, one of the most powerful scenes in Broken Lullaby arrives when Dr. Hoffmeister, there played by  Lionel Barrymore, comes across a group of fellow villagers in the local pub being led in anti-French sentiment by Kreutz.
  Positive
Barrymore's character admonishes them by reminding them that they are just as guilty for the death of their sons as the French soldiers that shot them because they were the ones who unthinkingly sent them off to battle to be slaughtered.
  Negative
In , this scene must have been devastating to audiences of the time' in Ozons version, it just comes across as a melodramatic monologue and nothing more.
  Negative
Perhaps recognizing this, Ozon has tried to shift the focus of the story from the antiwar sentiments that dominated the original film to emphasize the romantic elements, even going so far as adding on all the stuff involving Anna following Adrien to Paris.
  Negative
This is a move that winds up having mixed results.
  Negative
On the one hand, Ozon seems to connect more directly with this material, especially in the way that the emphasis of the story is now centered on Anna and her inner turmoil rather than on the relationship between her and Adrien, which never quite comes alive due to Niney's odd performance, whose Adrien demonstrates more genuine on-screen chemistry with Frantz than he does with Anna.
  Negative
In a move that will no doubt disappoint Ozon fans, nothing is made of this particular development.
  Negative
On the other hand, despite the good performance by Beer as Anna, the shift means, among other things, that Frantzs parents end up disappearing from the latter half of the film in what becomes an increasingly glaring absence.
  Positive
The other real problem with Frantz is that it is a curiously muted and unambitious effort for a director as normally audacious as Ozon.
  Negative
Apart from a couple of minor stylistic quirks, such as shooting in a black-and-white that occasionally bleeds into color during the pre-war flashbacks, even the most keenly aware fan would be hard-pressed to recognize it as one of his films.
  Negative
In fact, there is really only one scene that comes close to approaching the daring that he is usually known for a powerful moment in which he takes one of the most famous scenes in movie history, the singing of La Marseillaise in  Casablanca, and slyly subverts it in order to show the incipient violence and cruelty hiding just beneath the surface patriotism.
  Negative
If Frantz had contained more moments like that, it might have developed into a genuinely powerful drama worthy of its immensely gifted director instead of just a well-meaning drag.
  Negative
