For a cautionary tale issued well past its prime, Cell isnt bad.
  Negative
More a leisurely paced, character-driven drama with horror elements than an outright thriller, Cell wants to warn viewers that they have become too attached to their mobile devices.
  Negative
This message was timely back in , when the  Stephen King bestseller this film is based on hit bookstores, but it bears some repeating.
  Neutral
Besides, theres mild amusement to be had watching people shuffle around like violent zombies as a result ofcellphone usage.
  Negative
The visual metaphor might be considered a bit too "on the nose," but I didnt mind.
  Negative
Ive got a big nose, so it fit just fine.
  Positive
Far more problematic is the films occasional lack of storytelling clarity.
  Negative
Those familiar with the book will be able to fill in the blanks.
  Positive
Anyone walking in blind may experience something akin to the temporary, frustrating loss of phone service when one drives through a tunnel.
  Negative
Cell appears to play fast and loose with its phone-based affliction, something that might have been cleared up had Cell gone the mini-series route like Kings prior novels Under the Dome and "--."
  Negative
Couple this confusion with an unsatisfying, ambiguous ending, and one can see why, despite featuring A-list stars, Cell sat on the shelf for two years before getting a limited release.
  Very negative
With a bigger budget and a longer runtime, Cell could easily have been elevated above its current station as a worthy  AM viewing on cable not that theres anything wrong with that.
  Negative
Its cursed with some really cheap CGI, but blessed with actors who are game for, and respect, the material.
  Positive
Cell reunites  John Cusack with  Samuel L. Jackson for their second King feature together after the superb , and both turn in good performances.
  Very positive
Jackson is particularly effective, going the subdued route when larger-than-life Jackson would have been, in this case, completely understandable.
  Positive
Cusack wears the weight of his character, Clays divorce on his shoulders in every frame' his emotional, desperate attempts to reunite with his ex-wife and son drive the narrative once all hell breaks loose.
  Negative
Hell chooses Logan Airport for its coming out party.
  Negative
A mysterious pulse suddenly turns every traveler using acellphone into a raging, violent lunatic.
  Neutral
These people arent zombies, as theyre not dead, but they have all the familiar cinematic characteristics of fast-moving zombies.
  Negative
Cell calls these people "phoners."
  Neutral
Caught in the ensuing phoner carnage is Cusacks Clay, whosecellphone battery goes kaput just before the pulse hits.
  Negative
When people start killing each other, Clay is on a pay phone that is as reminiscently old school as this films pacing.
  Negative
Unfortunately, Clay was speaking to his wife, Sharon  Clark Sarullo on hercellphone.
  Negative
This only fuels Clays desire to get to Sharons New Hampshire address once he realizes the pulse is a nationwide event.
  Negative
Escaping into Bostons subway system, Clay meets up with train conductor Tom Jackson, forming an alliance that grows into a doomed yet compelling friendship.
  Positive
Joining them on their journey is Alice Isabelle Furhman, Clays shell-shocked neighbor who has just killed her infected mother, and Jordan  Owen Teague, the sharpest kid in a prep school whose entire student body has become phoners.
  Negative
Rounding out this motley crew is Jordans headmaster, played by  Stacy Keach.
  Negative
Not since  Wilford Brimley in Hard Target have I been so giddy to see an old-saw character actor show up wielding a bow and arrow.
  Negative
Keachs screen-time is short, but he dominates every scene.
  Negative
Hardcore horror fans will probably be disappointed with "Cell."
  Negative
Director  Tod Williams  The Door in the Floor seems more comfortable highlighting the underlying macabre elements in the films dramatic scenes than in depicting gory violence.
  Negative
Kings graphic opening chapter of "Cell," which relocates the films airport attack to Boston Commons, gave me nightmares after I read it.
  Negative
Williams depiction is a decent action sequence, but its not scary.
  Positive
A later scene, set in a bar, is far more effective and creepy.
  Negative
This isnt to say that Williams is unaware hes making a Stephen King movie' a scene featuring a truck filled with gasoline and a soccer field covered with teenagers ranks as one of the blackest depictions of morbid humor Ive seen in years.
  Negative
Cusack and Jackson sell the scene so well that its squirm-inducing without having to resort to graphic gore.
  Positive
There are other notable moments that make Cell better than expected, sly little bits meant for maximum effect.
  Negative
Notice how the camera lovingly caresses that huge butcher knife in the airport restaurant kitchen just before the pulse, or how Jacksons beautiful voice-over prayer ends with a shot of a single tear running down Jordans cheek.
  Negative
Williams and King, who co-wrote the screenplay, want us to care about the characters because well be spending so much downtime with them between scenes of violence.
  Positive
As a result, their expected demises have the power to sting.
  Neutral
Unlike the numerous angry reviewers on IMDb, I wasnt upset that Cell deviates from the book.
  Negative
One cant squeeze  pages into  minutes.
  Neutral
I do wish, however, that the film werent so rushed and unclear in its details about the pulse and its aftermath.
  Negative
The concept of humankind turning into one enormous mobile hotspot for use by an evil mastermind has legs.
  Neutral
Its too bad Cell cuts the idea off at the knees.
  Negative
