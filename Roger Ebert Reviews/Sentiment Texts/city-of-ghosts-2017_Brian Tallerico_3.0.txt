The men and women profiled in  Matthew Heinemans City of Ghosts are certainly haunted.
  Neutral
They look at photos of the people who have died in their hometown of Raqqa and they question whether or not everything theyve done to shine a spotlight on the horrific situation there has been worth it.
  Neutral
And, in a sense, they are ghosts as well, haunting the new residents of their home from afar, doing everything they can to destroy their hateful regime.
  Positive
Coming on the crest of a wave of documentaries about Syria this year, including Cries From Syria, The White Helmets and Last Man in Aleppo, City of Ghosts doesnt feel like it has the impact of Heinemans previous film, the searing  Cartel Land, but it is still a worthwhile examination of the importance of an institution currently under siege around the world: journalism.
  Positive
Dont get me wrong.
  Negative
I would never directly compare what the talking heads on American cable news do to the courageous acts of the men and women of the group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently RBSS.
  Negative
But I do wonder what the current assault on journalism externally from people like the President and internally from corporate control of the world of media and what that does to integrity does to the next generation.
  Negative
When I grew up, journalism was still esteemed and deemed essential to a functioning democracy.
  Negative
Kids today arent being given that message, no matter what you think of CNN or FakeNews, and thats going to have an impact.
  Neutral
City of Ghosts serves as a stark reminder that journalism not only matters, but it is essential to fighting evil, which cannot flourish as easily in a spotlight.
  Negative
In my opinion, a camera is more powerful than a weapon, says one of the RBSS members profiled in City of Ghosts, all of whom have had to flee the city of Raqqa and coordinate coverage of whats happening there from afar.
  Negative
They have safe houses in Turkey and Germany, at which most of the documentary unfolds, and from which they remain in contact with undercover reporters in the wartorn city.
  Negative
During the Syrian Civil War in , ISIS took Raqqa, making it the center of recruitment for their cause and training for their soldiers.
  Negative
Consequently, the city has been virtually destroyed, both by the ISIS and by the Syrian, Russian, and U.S. governments attacking it.
  Negative
RBSS realized how little was being reported on the conditions in Raqqa, and fought back, posting stories and videos that defy the ISIS propaganda.
  Negative
One of the most interesting aspects of City of Ghosts is how important production values are to a cause.
  Positive
ISIS took off with recruiting when it upgraded its videos, turning them into riffs on  Grand Theft Auto that promise kids with little hope or future an adventure for a cause in which they can believe.
  Negative
RBSS fights back with similarly high degrees of production in their videos and stories, most with confrontational headlines like Children Are ISISs Firewood.
  Negative
Its a media war with recruitment on one side and exposure on the other.
  Positive
While Cartel Land plummeted us into the violence of a terrifying part of the world, City of Ghosts maintains an interesting distance as we spend most of the film in Turkey and Germany.
  Positive
The few RBSS members still in Raqqa cant be identified, of course, and they struggle even to get information out of the city, especially after ISIS starts tearing down satellite dishes.
  Negative
Theyre literally turning an entire city into an ISIS stronghold, killing anyone who disagrees.
  Negative
The fact that there are people in other countries trying to destroy their tyranny through information must infuriate them, and, again, it reminds one why journalism matters as much now as it ever did.
  Negative
In a truly interconnected world, we should all know about whats happening in Raqqa and know about the courage of RBSS in reporting on it.
  Negative
In a sense, the film sometimes feels like both an exaltation and an indictment in that the story of Raqqa is STILL underreported in an American journalism industry more interested in Crossfire-style arguments than international news.
  Negative
Even though its a doc, I would never spoil exactly what they are but City of Ghosts ends with two scenes that really capture what Heineman is going for.
  Negative
In one, a man resembles more of a ghost, shaking after another reminder of his lack of safety and looking at photos of the friends and fellow journalists hes lost.
  Negative
But Heineman doesnt end there.
  Negative
He tacks on an epilogue that reminds us all of the cycle of life and the importance of fighting.
  Negative
We should be thankful there are people who havent given up.
  Negative
