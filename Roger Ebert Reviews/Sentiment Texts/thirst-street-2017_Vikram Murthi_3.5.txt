Nathan Silvers romantic drama Thirst Street follows a flight attendants spiraling amour fou towards a Parisian bartender, but while thats an appropriate description of the films premise, it doesnt quite capture what makes it interesting.
  Positive
Its a portrait of obsession that doesnt caricaturize nor ridicule, an empathetic account of desire and its inherent limitations, as well as an opaque psychological study that falls in line with lifes myriad mysteries.
  Very negative
No great happiness comes without great pain, intones the narrator  Anjelica Huston, wryly but with warmth.
  Positive
Its the films modus operandi, but Silver, and his co-writer C. Mason Wells, never shirk the platitudes nasty, dangerous implications, especially with relation to the characters competing passions, and yet they somehow accomplish this with affection.
  Neutral
After the death of her lover, the grief-stricken Gina  Lindsay Burdge hooks up with the charismatic bartender Jerome  Damien Bonnard on a layover in Paris.
  Negative
Though Jerome clearly adopts a politely detached view towards Gina, she independently decides that she needs to be in Jeromes life.
  Negative
Jeromes early attempts to let Gina down easily predictably fail, and soon she quits her job, moves into an apartment around the corner from Jeromes without his knowledge, of course, and begins working at his club.
  Negative
Its obvious from the beginning that Ginas fascination will eventually curdle into mania, but Silver and Wells gentle-yet-firm approach to Ginas predicament, along with the reactions of those in her orbit, separate Thirst Street from the historical sexism of the woman stalks man subgenre.
  Neutral
Formally and narratively, the film never takes delusion or its targets lightly, and always conveys the understanding that such psychological states derive from the darkest, most vulnerable places.
  Negative
While that sense of compassion lies in Thirst Streets script and direction, its best evoked in Burdges and Bonnards performances.
  Negative
Burdge imbues Gina with sympathy and kindness, capturing the personality of a fundamentally nice person who doesnt understand boundaries or other peoples feelings' her characters inability to read a room will ultimately be her downfall, but Burdge renders that end inevitably tragic.
  Positive
Meanwhile, Bonnard wonderfully plays her foil, someone who tries to navigate his admirers mood, keeping his distance but also being as amiable as possible.
  Negative
Their crackling sexual chemistry and awkward personal interactions make for a compelling on-screen romance, and the way that it devolves when Jeromes ex-girlfriend Clemence  Esther Garrel comes into the picture charges almost every scene.
  Negative
Its somewhat of a critical clich to describe a cinematographer as a co-director, but  Sean Price Williams hazy, luminous photography in Thirst Street so strongly defines its aesthetic that it all but elevates him to co-author status.
  Negative
The sensuous, vibrant colors and the intimate framing provide a classically romantic sheen that stands in sharp contrast to the more insidious on-screen events.
  Very positive
Moreover, it augments Ginas internal desire to have a grand romance, one worthy of old musicals, but still grounds her actions in an uncomfortable reality.
  Negative
Along those lines,  Paul Grimstads nervy score also establishes the films tricky tone, neatly capturing the lustful urgency that underscores the film without overwhelming its action.
  Positive
If Thirst Street has any major flaw, its that the predictability of the films narrative pales in comparison to its stirring aesthetics.
  Negative
At a brisk  minutes, Thirst Street never overstays its welcome, but by the last  or so, the film makes most of the requisite genre moves and it falls into a semi-monotonous state.
  Negative
The films surprises lie mostly in its characterizations and visual strategy, which carry it far, and yet it doesnt sustain its initial energy by its end.
  Positive
You can argue that thats precisely the point, that the fixed nature of Ginas journey engenders the films spiky dread and overt tragedy, but when we finally get there, it falls a little too flat to be completely ignored.
  Negative
But theres something special about Silvers film that often resides in its margins.
  Positive
Its self-contained world feels inhabited yet enigmatic, especially the once glamorous, now seedy cabaret club where Jerome works, run by the sleazily forthright Franz  Jacques Nolot.
  Negative
Theres the potent thread of over-symbolizing ones life, reading too much into strangers clairvoyance and random signals from the universe Gina sees a sign that reads A Louer outside of an apartment' though it means For Rent, Louer also invites the misreading of Lover.
  Negative
The lost-in-translation comedy, while trite or tired in the wrong hands, excels here mostly because Gina never once feels self-conscious about flubbing her way through conversations.
  Negative
But Thirst Street succeeds on the basis of Silver and Wells treatment of desperation, the frayed assuredness that surfaces when one realizes that theres nothing left to lose.
  Negative
Its a hard thing for a film to convey without over-psychologizing its subjects, but Thirst Street fittingly captures this in snapshots and glimpses.
  Neutral
The result is a slow-motion car crash that you intimately experience from both in and outside the car.
  Neutral
Theres just enough distance to allow for wisdom but not enough so as not to feel the impact.
  Negative
