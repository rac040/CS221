You should always have something to fall back on.

Me, Ive got magic!
  Positive
John Candy, doing a slightly pointed sendup of  Orson Welles, made that joke in a great SCTV sketch in .
  Negative
The real-life Welles regularly sawed  Marlene Dietrich in half to entertain the troops during World War II, and played magicians or illusionists in films.
  Positive
His final completed feature, F For Fake, opens with him doing a little hand magic, before concocting a remarkable illusion in the form of an essay film for  minutes.
  Positive
The magician is an actor, Welles himself is heard reflecting at the opening of this entertaining documentary directed by Chuck Workman, the master montage-maker whose work is a consistent highlight of the Academy Awards ceremonies every year.
  Positive
Magician is hardly a definitive account of the inordinately complex actor and creator that was Welles at a mere  minutes, it could more accurately be deemed the tip of an iceberg but it offers a not-bad education for folks who arent as familiar with the man and his work as they ought to be, and a few not insubstantial satisfactions for folks like myself, who agree with  Jean-Luc Godards assessment of the man and his work: All of us will always owe him everything.
  Negative
For one thing, Workmans film tells a different story from that of showbiz conventional wisdom.
  Positive
That is that the always precocious Welles theres nothing more hateful, he chucklingly admits, than the kind of prodigy he was at the age of ten was a wunderkind who peaked with his first commercial film thats s  Citizen Kane, still a ripping yarn, poignant reflection, and galvanic primer of cinema language and descended into a career purgatory of his own profligate making shortly thereafter.
  Negative
No, throughout its depiction of what it divides up as four phases of Welles life, Workmans movie never stops depicting Welles as an artist: a restless, searching, often frustrated and sometimes frustrating artist, one who never stopped working but who worked in a fashion completely incomprehensible to the conventional wisdom of the cinema industry.
  Very negative
One interviewee points out that film is the only art form in which its considered eccentric, if not wasteful, to have left behind as large a body of unfinished work as Welles did.
  Negative
Of course the fact that there is so much unfinished work isnt quite so bothersome as that its so hard to see, and the film seems almost weary in its final quarter as it has to make caveats concerning the unavailability of so much of Welles' work.
  Negative
Take  Falstaff, a.k.a. Chimes At Midnight.
  Neutral
This wonderful  Shakespeare hybrid is confidently proclaimed by actor, director and Welles biographer  Simon Callow as finally, Welles masterpiece a piece of purposefully provocative quasi-heresy, given the likes of Kane, the compromised The Magnificent Ambersons, and the magnificent, and largely uncompromised, The Trial, but after the few minutes devoted to it the viewer is informed that its tied up in legal battles.
  Positive
Theres a sense here that Workmans film, coming as it does a little prior to the centenary of Welles birth, and a possible construction and release of Welles last fully shot but largely unedited project The Other Side of The Wind, has something of an activist agenda: look at the works of this amazing film and theater director, scattered in disarray over the four corners of the globe, Workman seems to be saying.
  Negative
Cant we do better?
  Neutral
Film lovers of every generation have to hope we can, and do.
  Positive
In the meantime, while this film elides a lot and makes a questionable choice or two in its portrayals of Welles outsize personality I like Wolfgang Pucks cooking as much as the next person whos been to Spago, but Im not sure his comments on Welles epicure side were entirely necessary here, it goes to most of the right people when it comes to shattering the myth of Welles the Hollywood flameout: critichistorians Jonathan Rosenbaum and Joseph McBride chime in with apt observations, and Welles longtime companion Oja Kodar is energetic and vibrant and even rather charmingly eccentric.
  Positive
Whatever its shortcomings, Magician accomplishes quite a bit as a corrective, and it also gives one an hour and a half in the company of Orson Welles.
  Positive
That in and of itself is worth at least a three-star rating.
