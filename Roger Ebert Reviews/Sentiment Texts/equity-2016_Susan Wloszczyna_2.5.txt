Equity'"s main claim to fame is that its the first female-dominated depiction of the cutthroat dealings that define greed-is-good, ethics-are-overrated Wall Street.
  Negative
Given that most movies with plots revolving around the high-stakes financial world tend to slot women into peripheral roles think  Daryl Hannah as yuppie eye candy in  Wall Street or  Margot Robbie explaining the ins and outs of sub-prime mortgages while cavorting in a bubble bath in  The Big Short any upgrade in gender representation would be an improvement.
  Negative
I can think of just one stock-market-related showcase of recent vintage, where an actress was allowed to have the same impact as her numerous masculine counterparts, and that would be  Demi Moore in the well-received yet underseen  Margin Call.
  Negative
But  Equity goes a step further by allowing women to call the shots behind the camera as well.
  Positive
One glance at the credits reveals that this drama, about a veteran investment banker played by  Anna Gunn of Breaking Bad who wages a fight to maintain her high-level professional status, boasts an admirable commitment to recruiting members of the consistently under-employed cinematic sisterhood.
  Positive
Meera Menon Tribeca award winner for Farah Goes Bang directed and  Amy Fox  Heights wrote the screenplay, based on astory by  Sarah Megan Thomas.
  Negative
And two of the films stars  Alysia Reiner fiendish assistant warden Fig on Orange Is the New Black and Thomas are producers as well as the co-founders of Broad Street Pictures, a company dedicated to telling stories from a female perspective, starting with Equity.
  Positive
Being a woman who deeply cares about how we are portrayed in popular culture, I naturally have a rooting interest in  Equity.
  Negative
And, initially, the film does many things right.
  Negative
Gunns Naomi, for one, is an eminently watchable if atypical heroine.
  Very positive
Shes a sleekly attractive -something, with a figure that befits her age and the determined eyes of a tigress as she takes out her workplace frustrations on a punching bag at the gym.
  Positive
Screenwriter Amy Fox wisely gives Naomi a Gordon Gekko-like defining speech early on when she speaks at a career-mentoring event for women.
  Positive
When a moderator asks, What gets you up in the morning?
  Positive
she candidly responds: I like money like knowing I have it.
  Negative
She acknowledges her familys cash flow problems while growing up and the fact that she helped her younger brothers pay for college.
  Positive
But she also adds, unapologetically, It is OK to do it for ourselves for how it makes us feel.
  Positive
Secure, yeah.
  Positive
Powerful, absolutely.
  Positive
Her final suggestion: Dont let money be a dirty word.
  Neutral
Yes, women can be just as ambitious, ruthless and desirous of wealth and control as their male cohorts.
  Negative
Maybe even more so.
  Neutral
Still, the playing field isnt quite level, considering that Naomi is passed over for a promotion after being blamed for an initial public offering going awry and is told by her boss that she "rubs people the wrong way" a criticism that probably would never be lobbed at a man in her position.
  Negative
Instead of giving up, the specialist in Silicon Valley start-ups proceeds to double-down on efforts to seal the deal on handling the IPO for a hot tech commodity named Cachet.
  Negative
Meanwhile, there is a  Working Girl situation afoot between Naomi, the situation's Katharine Sigourney Weaver character here though somewhat more sympathetic, and ambitious underling Erin Sarah Megan Thomas, a shrewder spin on  Melanie Griffiths eager-to-please executive assistant Tess, whose less abrasive approach to negotiations is underappreciated.
  Negative
The pair does share one thing: A less-than-fulfilling personal life.
  Positive
Lest she falls off her career ladder, Erin feels compelled to conceal that she is in the early stages of pregnancy from her co-workers though sharp-eyed Naomi catches on and hides her lack of enthusiasm about the prospect of motherhood from her boyfriend.
  Negative
Naomi, on the other hand, has an ongoing friends-with-benefits situation with hedge-fund manager Michael  James Purefoy, whose supposedly joking inquiry about the password for her work email hints at a possible hidden agenda.
  Negative
But my favorite two characters are probably the vilest.
  Negative
Reiner deliciously revels in her take-no-prisoners role as a Justice Department investigator whose new beat involves white-collar crime such as insider trading.
  Negative
She reunites with her old college chum Naomi while not-so-secretly angling for info on Michael in order to snare one of his corrupt colleagues.
  Neutral
Meanwhile, Naomi has her hands full catering to the whims of Ed  Samuel Roukin the arrogant Zuckerberg-like wunderkind behind Cachet, complete with a hoodie-heavy wardrobe, whose roving eye briefly settles upon Erin.
  Negative
But while  Equity has all the signposts of a tense on-the-job thriller  la  Michael Clayton and boasts the capable cast to pull it off, it too often meanders with little in the way of snap, crackle or pop to energize its interactions and confrontations, and is further dragged down by sluggish editing and the lack of surprising developments.
  Negative
Also regrettable is how little screen time is afforded to such fine actresses as  Margaret Colin,  Carrie Preston so memorable on  The Good Wife as easily-distracted attorney Elsbeth Tascioni and up-and-comer Sophie von Haselberg  Bette Midlers daughter.
  Negative
Lets give some points to how the men, even though they are distinctly secondary to the ladies in the cast, dont come off as tossed-off clichs.
  Negative
And bravo for having the guts to deliver a fairly downbeat if realistic ending, along with a killer scene where Gunn throws a metaphorical fit over an inferior chocolate chip cookie.
  Negative
Good intentions do count even if the outcome is not perfect.
  Positive
Here is hoping that future productions from Broad Street Pictures prove more satisfying and offer bigger payoffs.
  Neutral
