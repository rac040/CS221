There's darkness that is moody and effective.
  Positive
And then there is incompetent darkness where you can barely see what is going on.
  Negative
"The Bag Man", helmed by first-time director  David Grovic, features darkness of the latter kind.
  Positive
Watching "The Bag Man", if nothing else, gives you a heightened appreciation of the lighting designers in the s and s, who were able to fill those noir screens with encroaching shadows, creating a palpable sense of impending doom, while never sacrificing clarity of image.
  Positive
"The Bag Man" is so sloppily executed it feels like they didn't have enough light fixtures to get the effects they wanted.
  Negative
But that's only one of the problems.
  Negative
The acting is fine.
  Positive
The story is pretty stock, but there's no shame in a stock story.
  Negative
The main issue is the script co-wirtten by Grovik and  Paul Conway, which is too clever for its own good, giving an impression of being very pleased with itself.
  Negative
Quentin Tarantino's scripts burst onto the scene in the early-s with a fresh voice and a fresh point of view, adding layers of irony and post-modern awareness to what were well-known cinematic tropes.
  Positive
Grovic tries to place his film in the same bucket but it suffers in comparison.
  Negative
John Cusack plays Jack, a hired gun, on the run from a shady past, involving an ex-wife who was murdered after they had an argument about his job.
  Negative
Robert De Niro plays a heavy named Dragna, who hires Jack to transport a mysterious black leather bag for him.
  Neutral
Jack is warned over and over again to not look in the bag.
  Negative
The job is simple on the face of it: retrieve the bag, go to a specific motel, and wait in Room  for further instructions.
  Positive
Things go south almost immediately, of course, and the situation is exacerbated by the fact that the motel Jack is told to check into is, bar none, the creepiest motel in the history of America.
  Very negative
Run by a wheelchair-bound paranoid guy played by  Crispin Glover, who shades of "Psycho" has a dead mother, the motel is populated by a motley crew of violent misfits, including a pimp with an eye patch, a cackling, evil Serbian-Roma dwarf in a tracksuit, and a leggy, blue-wigged hooker named Rivka  Rebecca Da Costa, who says she's from Israel even though she isn't: "I like Israel.
  Negative
I love Israel."
  Neutral
Rivka latches herself onto Jack, hiding in his room from the pimp and the dwarf, who threaten to do horrible things to her when they retrieve her.
  Negative
Violence against Rivka is used as a motivating plot-point throughout, one of the script's more unsavory aspects.
  Negative
Later, when Jack and Rivka are hauled into a creepy police station for questioning and torture, Rivka lies mostly naked on a nearby table with one of the cops teasing at her panties with a threatening baton, and the Sheriff says to Jack, in an eyeroll of a line, "If you send us on some kind of wild goose chase, we will take liberties with the girl."
  Negative
The script keeps circling back over the same territory, lacking urgency or a push forward.
  Negative
Lines are repeated in a way that gives an impression of a script spinning its wheels.
  Negative
Robert De Niro's Dragna is a dude who wears plaid jackets, thick glasses, and his grey hair in a swoopy high pompadour.
  Negative
He is seemingly mild-mannered, and confesses that he wanted to go into "academia", but we know he is capable of violence' we see it early on.
  Negative
He courts Jack for the job by taking him for a flight in a gleaming private jet, carefully cutting his food up to demonstrate what he wants Jack to do: The broccoli is the money, the potato is the bag, etc.
  Negative
Dragna says things like, "I am a connoisseur of the unexpected but I don't like surprises."
  Negative
De Niro plays these ridiculous lines well, undercutting the script and underplaying, which is really the only way to go.
  Negative
Dragna comes off as a truly loopy individual, urging Jack to read Hermann Hesse's "Magister Ludi" before taking the job, and asking him later if he has read the book.
  Negative
The book might help Jack understand the game.
  Neutral
Because it's all a game, after all.
  Positive
And maybe that's the problem.
  Negative
"The Bag Man" feels like a game.
  Neutral
The stakes are seemingly high, but not really.
  Neutral
Will Jack look in the bag?
  Neutral
What do you think?
  Neutral
Will Rivka turn out to be more than she says she is?
  Negative
What do you think?
  Neutral
Even the big reveals, about the bag, and about Rivka, are handled in such a cliched manner that they lack the "Keyser Sze" gasp of understanding they seem to require.
  Negative
We've seen it all coming.
  Negative
We've seen it before.
  Negative
