In  Buster Keaton's  film "Cops," Keaton, for reasons too complicated to go into, finds himself sitting in a cart full of furniture, trying to get his horse to move faster.
  Negative
Keaton makes a pit-stop at a "Goat Gland Specialist," and hustles the horse through the door.
  Negative
Moments later, standing on the sidewalk, he looks around furtively, making sure no one is watching, and turns and strolls into the specialist's office himself.
  Negative
That scene would have killed in , but perhaps modern audiences need back-story.
  Neutral
Penny Lane's wonderfully entertaining documentary " Nuts!"
  Positive
may provide, among other things, enlightenment on what Buster Keaton and his sluggish horse might have been looking for through that doorway.
  Negative
"Nuts!"
  Positive
presents the life-story of a man named John R. Brinkley, whose fame spread far and wide in the s and s. Apparently, one day a farmer visited Brinkley's druggist's shop in Milford, Kansas population , and asked for help because he was a "flat tire" sexually, Dr. Brinkley got the idea of removing "good nuts" from billy-goats and inserting them into the "bad nuts" of impotent men.
  Very negative
Brinkley experimented, and it worked!
  Positive
The farmer had a spring in his step again, happy erections, and potent sperm filled with child-bearing potential.
  Positive
And so began the heyday of Dr. Brinkley.
  Positive
Brinkley opened a hospital, a herd of virile goats chewing grass on the lawn in front.

  Neutral
Penny Lane's previous film, " Our Nixon," took a well-known story and viewed it from an unexpected perspective, using the intimate humorous "home" movies made by the Praetorian Guard around President Nixon in the first years of the administration.
  Very positive
Lane has a gift for finding the unexpected in the familiar, the right narrative structure, however eccentric, to tell a story.
  Positive
Her documentaries are not your typical "talking head" affairs.
  Negative
"Nuts!"
  Positive
utilizes only a couple "talking heads," each with their own area of expertise.
  Positive
James Reardon shares his knowledge of the history of Kansas, its demographics and politics Brinkley, a famous man, eventually ran for office.

  Negative
Gene Fowler is radio historian Brinkley's main contribution to the world may have nothing to do with goat glands but his pioneering use of radio technology.
  Negative
The most striking part of "Nuts!"
  Positive
is its extensive use of animation.
  Neutral
Multiple animators were on the team.
  Neutral
At first the animation consists of greys and faded ivories and watercolor-smudged blacks, perfect for portraying the dawning decades of the new century.
  Positive
As the years go by, color starts to flash into it one man's electric-blue suit stark against the faceless mass of black-shadowed people behind him.
  Negative
The animation is abstract, sometimes nightmarish, and often very funny.
  Positive
Its imagery is like a sophisticated graphic novel.
  Positive
Accompanying the animation is the superb voice-over work done by  Andy Boswell,  John Causby,  Kelly Mizell,  Jeff Pillars,  Thom Stylinski and  Fran Taylor.
  Negative
They play a cast of hundreds, each voice distinct, the language often direct quotes from the public record one farmer testifies at a hearing, bluntly, unashamed: "I used to have a floppy dong, but it ain't floppy no more."
  Negative
Current animated films use name actors for all of the voices, and many of them do wonderful work, but sometimes what you need are practiced mimics, chameleons, funny-voice experts.
  Positive
These voiceover artists are convincing as uneducated farmers, prudish old ladies, sinister politicians, snooty doctors, and whispering crowds of scandalized people.
  Negative
There are surprises along the way, bombshells even, events that made front-page news across the country at the time.
  Positive
Brinkley is presented as a plucky pioneer, solving people's sexual ills and using his popular radio show to educate his listeners about sex Fowler, the radio historian, calls Brinkley the "Dr. Ruth Westheimer of the s".
  Negative
But there's more to it, and Lane dispenses it in fragments so that it feels like you're reading along with the newspapers of the day.
  Negative
Lane has tracked down extensive home movie and newsreel footage, as well as snippets of Brinkley's various radio addresses.
  Negative
Brinkley was a man who understood publicity and the power of personality.
  Positive
So there's footage of Brinkley in his garden, Brinkley and his wife and child lounging by a pool, Brinkley and his son catching fish, the Brinkley family boarding their private plane purchased from Charles Lindbergh.
  Negative
There are multiple relevant critiques in the content, should you be looking for them.
  Positive
There were debates about health care during those decades, about the population wanting the right to choose their own doctors.
  Positive
Medicine used to be mostly guess-work, doctors using leeches, purges, enemas, on ailing people, the cures often more deadly than the illness itself.
  Very negative
Once doctors started consolidating themselves into associations, the independents were run out of town on a rail.
  Negative
Sharing knowledge and peer review became mandatory.
  Negative
Dr. Morris Fishbein fought with evangelical fanaticism to eradicate "quacks," his main target being Brinkley.
  Negative
"It's not medicine Dr. Brinkley is practicing," thundered Fishbein.
  Negative
"It's big business!"
  Positive
Fishbein, incidentally, was excellent friends with H.L. Mencken, the cranky "sage of Baltimore," who wrote essay after essay throughout the s, attacking "quackery" and snake-oil salesmen and "herbalists," stating in no uncertain terms: "What is needed is a scientific inquiry into the matter, under rigid test conditions, by a committee of men learned in the architecture and plumbing of the body, and of a high and incorruptible sagacity."
  Very negative
Quackery or no, there's a reason audiences in  would have been rolling in the aisles seeing Buster Keaton slip furtively through that goat gland door.
  Negative
Lane helps us understand why.
  Positive
