"And So It Goes" does what it needs to do for its target audience in thoroughly sufficient, mediocre ways.
  Negative
An unlikely romance between widows in their s, it aims to charm older, underserved moviegoers those who get a " The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel" or some such only about once a year but it does so with barely a trace of wit, verve or inspiration.
  Negative
Its fine.
  Positive
Its just not good.
  Negative
Its also not "As Good As It Gets," even though both films share the same screenwriter  Mark Andrus, misanthropic male protagonists and interchangeably forgettable titles.
  Negative
Rob Reiner is firmly in late-career mode here, playing it safe and hitting all the expected notes as he directs veterans  Michael Douglas and  Diane Keaton, who are nothing if not total pros as they try to breathe life into such strained material.
  Negative
During the moments when "And So It Goes" isnt overreaching for wacky laughs or going all gooey and soggy when Douglas and Keatons characters have the opportunity to open themselves up to each other, quietly Reiners film can be effective and even enjoyable.
  Positive
But those moments are rare.
  Positive
More often, theyre bickering or awkwardly flirting as they reach their inevitable destination of canned romantic bliss.
  Negative
Douglas, as longtime Connecticut real estate agent Oren Little, is very much in the mode of  Jack Nicholsons curmudgeonly "As Good As It Gets" character, Melvin Udall.
  Negative
Hes turned cranky and cruel since his wifes death from cancer a decade ago, unleashing his vitriol on children and the elderly, strangers and longtime colleagues alike.
  Negative
Hes a casually racist drunk and he hates dogs.
  Negative
Surely he is due for a change of heart.
  Positive
Keaton co-stars as Leah Hartman, Orens next-door neighbor in the quaint, waterfront fourplex where hes living while he tries to sell his .
  Negative
million mansion.
  Neutral
Her husband also died a while ago' since then, shes tried to reinvent herself as a lounge singer and serves as the buildings de facto den mother.
  Negative
Reiner stops the film for large portions of time to let Keaton warble classic tunes in a heartfelt whisper.
  Neutral
It is very uncomfortable to watch.
  Negative
Basically, she is every character Keaton has played for the past decade or so: flighty and full of supposedly lovable tics and quirks.
  Negative
Surely, she will facilitate Orens change of heart.
  Positive
Actually, they change each other in speedy, implausible ways: He helps her toughen up, she helps him soften.
  Negative
Nothing here is a spoiler.
  Negative
The outcome is evident from the poster alone.
  Neutral
Heres what forces the feel-goodery: Orens estranged son Scott Shepherd, a recovering heroin addict, shows up one day out of nowhere and announces he has a -year-old daughter  Sterling Jerins.
  Negative
He also needs Oren to care for said daughter while he goes off to prison for the next nine months for something he didnt actually do, naturally.
  Negative
Do you think its possible that Oren and Leah will learn how to come together and function as a makeshift family for this shy, sweet little girl?
  Negative
Oren has a penchant for saying the wrong thing at the wrong time that is, until he promptly turns around and says the most perfect, poignant thing when its needed most.
  Positive
Similarly, in a moment thats meant to be a sad goodbye, Oren will crack a terrible joke and ruin the mood.
  Negative
Reiner repeatedly makes these jarring shifts in tone, but mostly is working in sitcom mode.
  Negative
Whenever a Rottweiler appears, for example, you know itll either a take a dump on the lawn or b hump a giant, stuffed teddy bear.
  Negative
Reiner himself actually appears in a small role as the supportive, toupeed pianist who accompanies Leah as she performs at a local restaurant.
  Negative
At one point while picking her up for a date, he accidentally steps onto a Slip N Slide, falls flat on his butt and gets soaked.
  Negative
Its an apt metaphor.
  Neutral
