Theres  Brandy Burre and theres Brandy Burre, a distinction that becomes increasingly muddled throughout the course of the documentary Actress.
  Negative
Actually, even calling Actress a documentary doesnt feel entirely accurate.
  Positive
Certainly, director  Robert Greene documents moments in the life of Burre, a mother of two who gave up her acting career and moved to the scenic Hudson River town of Beacon, New York,  miles north of Manhattan.
  Positive
They range from mundane the daily hassles of getting her young son and daughter dressed and out the door in the morning to monumental shifts the disintegration of her longtime relationship with the childrens father, restaurateur Tim Reinke.
  Negative
But complicating matters is the aesthetic Greene has chosen in following Burre as her restless spirit takes hold and inspires her to re-enter the industry.
  Negative
As Burres next-door neighbor and friend, hes had a front-row seat for the many changes that occurred in her life as she approached .
  Negative
He alternates between intimate, unadorned domestic glimpses Burre drinking red wine alone in sweats and a sloppy ponytail and artful interludes in rich color and exquisite slow motion water gushing from the kitchen faucet onto a sponge as she scrubs dishes.
  Negative
Hes toying with us constantly and with our perception of what is authentic in ways that are both intriguing and frustrating.
  Positive
Burre is too' she seems to relish trying on the role of the bored, apron-ed housewife whos straight out of a  Douglas Sirk melodrama, but she can also be very direct, pragmatic and of-the-moment, as in her meticulous labeling of the kids toy bins.
  Negative
With her long, dark hair, deep-set eyes and strong cheekbones, she has an inherently dramatic presence about her.
  Positive
But she also talks to her kids like theyre little people rather than babies including dropping an F-bomb in front of her then--year-old girl and finds herself saying the sort of ridiculous things all mothers do.
  Negative
Eat the cereal.
  Neutral
The cereal will heal your brain, she tells her daughter whos complaining of a headache.
  Negative
Being a performer, Burre is constantly aware that shes on camera and of the potential power that carries even more so than the average person, perhaps.
  Positive
Sitting on a beanbag chair in the kids play room, surrounded by stacks of board games and other sundry toys, she looks around and says wistfully: I moved to Beacon.
  Negative
Im not acting.
  Negative
So this is my creative outlet, I guess.
  Positive
Then she says the exact same thing a second time with a slightly different inflection, as if working through her lines to see which approach feels best.
  Negative
Greene doesnt spell out for us who Burre is, though, for a long time.
  Negative
In yet another method of challenging his audience, he drops us into her life and lets us figure it all out for ourselves.
  Positive
About a third of the way into the film, he shows her talking on the phone with someone about a possible gig, and in that call, she lays out both her resume and her game plan.
  Negative
Burre had a recurring role on the HBO drama The Wire.
  Neutral
After about  episodes, she was noticeably pregnant with her son, whos now , and that was the end of that.
  Negative
She and Tim had romantic notions of leaving their apartment in the big city, where shed also done some theater work, to raise a family in a small town upstate.
  Positive
Her new role would be parent and homemaker.
  Neutral
Tim remains a stoic, peripheral figure throughout, but fleshing him out would have helped us understand Burre and their relationship in a larger context.
  Negative
As it stands now, the film can feel a bit insular.
  Positive
Actress is more effective at revealing how Burre is torn between motherhood and stardom, and how she refuses to be defined exclusively by either.
  Negative
Greenes film is deceptively profound in that its about a specific woman with a specific kind of life, yet it has universal resonance as a reflection of the struggle so many women endure the desire to be all things to all people and inevitably failing someone, the yearning to balance career and parenthood and never finding enough time to do either completely right.
  Positive
And yes, men often do this sort of juggling, as well, but women tend to be harder on themselves about how well theyre doing it.
  Neutral
Greene is just as coy in his films conclusion, ending on a vague note of hope without giving too much away about its stars fate.
  Negative
Itll be interesting, though, to see if Burres career does take off again because of Actress if by being real, shes created the ultimate highlight reel.
  Negative
