Christmas Eve desperately wants to be a  Love Actually for those who might appreciate a yuletide film that at least acknowledges that there is a religious reason why we deck the halls.

But a humorless  Gary Cole impossible, I know, but he is, as a jaded atheist surgeon who nevertheless fulfills a dying patients wish that he pray for her, is a poor substitute for Hugh Grant's British prime minister giddily celebrating a victory over  Billy Bob Thorntons lascivious American president by shaking his groove thing to Jump.

This clumsy ensemble piece revolves around some not very interesting people who get stuck in six elevators in sundry Manhattan buildings after a delivery van accident cuts the power off on Dec.

It fails to provide the sorts of human inter-connections and deep revelations for which director  Mitch Davis seems to be striving.
  Very negative
God might work in mysterious ways, but Christmas Eve barely works at all with its misbegotten mingling of supposed mirth someone actually shoots off a pistol once or twice in one of the elevators just for kicks yeehaw!
  Negative
and tepid devotional drama.

That doesnt mean there arent surprises in store for anyone who stumbles upon this holiday turkey among the VOD titles on their TV listings, or finds it at an actual theater.
  Negative
The first is, despite regular cutaways to glossy generic footage of Big Apple landmarks decked out for the holidays, the film was shot entirely in Sofia, Bulgaria.
  Negative
I guess drab claustrophobic elevator interiors are pretty much the same around the world.

Next: Christmas Eve is CNN chat-meister Larry Kings first film producing credit, presumably because his seventh wife,  Shawn Southwick King, plays a nurse who encourages Cole to believe in things unseen.
  Negative
What she leaves unseen, however, is much acting talent.

But the most unexpected occurrence is the fact that somehow, someway, in a cast that is low on A-listers, the great  Patrick Stewart might give the worst performance as a bellicose business tycoon who is left stranded all alone in the winter cold, trapped in a cage-like lift atop a skyscraper under construction.
  Negative
After Trump-ishly harrumphing at employees trying to rescue him during his early scenes, this esteemed actor must monologue his way through a Scrooge-like change of heart a role that Stewart actually nailed in a  TV movie.
  Negative
Except, this time, his dialogue is unfortunately provided by Davis and his co-writer, not  Charles Dickens.
  Negative
On top of that, Napoleon Dynamite himself,  Jon Heder, might give the best performance as a just-fired tech specialist who is forced to share the office elevator with the fantasy-football-obsessed jerk who canned him  Max Casella.
  Negative
Or, as Heders character dubs him, the spawn of Satan himself.
  Neutral
As for the other inconvenienced elevator sharers, they include an annoying gum-chewing photog  James Roday of TVs Psych who badgers his shy female companion to pose for him like a model in exchange for a candy bar.
  Negative
For some reason, we are supposed to consider this a favor and not harassment.
  Negative
There is also a gang of seven bickering musicians, including Curb Your Enthusiasms  Cheryl Hines as a sassy trumpet player, who cant agree on much other than that someone has rudely farted in the confined quarters and not owned up to it.
  Negative
Then there is a randomly oddball quintet consisting of two TMI-afflicted ditzy girls, a musclebound dude in a skimpy Santa getup I thought I heard him mumble, I am a eunuch, but my mind might have been wandering off, an effete germophobe art expert and a high-IQ type in an Einstein T-shirt since that is what smart people like to wear who passes the time by testing everyone with brain teasers.
  Neutral
Oh, there is another surprise.
  Positive
Davis, who is also responsible for Mormon missionary drama The Other Side of Heaven, is rather timid about inserting many direct observations about religion into his script and instead forces us to infer what it means when several stuck characters are revealed to be related to those caught in different elevators.
  Negative
I am guessing it might have to do with it being a small world after all, or that fate, or some sort of Supreme Being, decided to teach these humans a lesson.
  Negative
The lesson I learned?
  Neutral
If you want to make an uplifting film, you wont get there with broken elevators.
