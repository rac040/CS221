The night they invented champagnethey absolutely knewthat all we'd want to dois fly to the sky on champagne.
  Neutral
So goes the song from Gigi.
  Negative
A pleasant thought, and I imagine some vintners wish that it had taken only one night to invent champagne.
  Positive
One can only imagine the nights, days, and years of trial and error that went into concocting the very precise and highly legally regulated process behind the creation of the only sparkling wine that can rightly be designated champagne.
  Negative
Because just as only whiskey made in Scotland can be called Scotch whiskey only sparkling wines made in the Champagne region of France a relatively narrow strip of a not-exactly- enormous country- be called Champagne.
  Negative
The reasons why, and many other seeming mysteries of process and designation, including the secret of how those bubbles come to animate a beverage that is not, in fact, carbonated, are provided in this brisk, entertaining film, directed by  David Kennard, who last year addressed red-wine concerns with the documentary A Year In Burgundy.
  Negative
Spectacularly photographed throughout by Jamie LeJeune, the movie opens with a birds- eye view of a field of grapes.
  Negative
This is courtesy of a hot-air balloon ride taken to celebrate the th birthday of Xavier Gonet, one half of the champagne-making concern Gonet- Medeville.
  Positive
Gonet seems a genial enough fellow, even as he describes the effect his balloon-ride provided him: We were like gods...looking down on our subjects.
  Negative
It was fun.
  Positive
Okay, fella.
  Neutral
While the style of the movies prose narration is a little pedestrian, its packed with information: for example, under the topsoil of the fields where champagne grapes are grown, the ground is largely chalk weird, right?
  Negative
and this somehow accounts for the clean crisp finish of the beverage.
  Positive
Despite the finitude of the product, the film notes that Champagne is an industry with a massive global market to defend, in part at least because of its mythic stature among celebratory intoxicants.
  Negative
Alternating with detailed descriptions of the arcane practices involved with its manufacture it takes a really dedicated winemaker to look after the bottle-revolving process that rids the liquid of its sediment and chronicles of the tragic, war-wracked regions that gave birth to the quaff, the movie has some compelling content to share.
  Neutral
And the views of the French countryside it offers, not to mention of pleasant villages whose populaces seem refreshingly tied to the land rather than to their digital devices, constitute a kind of cinematic vacation for the viewer interested in such a thing.
  Negative
But Kennard is also pretty devoted to his commonplaces, and the way he dots the movies soundtrack with snippets of Beethovens Seventh Symphony and Strausss Blue Danube waltz is a bit predictable.
  Negative
Its also telling that while he enjoys laying out the arcane rules of Champagne-making in great detail  pounds of grapes must produce only eight ounces of juice, holey moley thats a lot of grapes, when it comes to labor relations between the very nice and well-off families who run the vineyards and the folks who actually pick the grapes, the movie shows somewhat less engagement.
  Negative
Im not saying theres a scandal being ignored here, just that it might be nice in the film to hear from someone who doesnt get to look down on the grapevines like a god.
  Negative
Were supposed to coo at the adorability of the grandchildren of the sports-car driving fat cats who do some light picking of a weekend to get a feel for the activity, but we never find out the perspective of the picker who really has to put his or her back into the work.
  Negative
One hopes that they get a free bottle or two as a bonus.
  Negative
Still: the mental stress of this work is clearly not nothing.
  Negative
Theres so much that can go wrong, that even the most self-satisfied of the vintner has control over, that one cant help but admire the skill and persistence of Champagne makers.
  Negative
After all, bathtub gin can get one just as drunk, if not drunker.
  Negative
The Champagne experience is a particular one, and even if you dont imbibe this movie can give you an appreciation for what makes it special.
  Positive
