If you believe Twitter, then  Justin Bieber is retiring at the age of .
  Negative
He made the announcement the day before his new movie, " Justin Bieber's Believe" opened, so we can take it all with a pound of salt.
  Negative
Cue the agonized screams of millions of his fans.
  Positive
But they've been screaming anyway, and will continue to do so, because when tween and teen girls latch onto a figure like Bieber, nothing will tear them asunder.
  Negative
"Justin Bieber's Believe" is directed by Jon Chu, who also directed Bieber's most recent tour, which explains its uncritical attitude towards the young star.
  Negative
The whole thing is obviously part of the propaganda arm of the Bieber PR machine.
  Negative
Incidentally, and importantly, the propaganda element of the film showing us how hard Bieber works, how he put the "Believe" tour together, performances from the tour itself is the best part of the whole thing.
  Positive
It's infectious, as a matter of fact: the enthusiasm of the entire team is infectious.
  Very positive
And the fans?
  Neutral
Well, they could power the entire Eastern Seaboard with their excitement.
  Positive
This film is for them, clearly, and so the fact that Bieber is not asked tough questions about some of his tabloid-worthy shenanigans is not a surprise.
  Negative
It makes the film a strangely uneven experience, and you sense that there may be some really interesting questions that could be asked and answered, if everyone could stop being so in awe of the young pop-music god in their midst.
  Very negative
The film opens with a casual closeup of Bieber messing around at the piano, making comments to someone offscreen, but also engrossed in his improvisation.
  Negative
Next we see him hanging out in a dressing room, with a wall of his shoes filling the frame, and an assistant-type is saying to him, "Do we want to shave your mustache?"
  Negative
First of all: the peach fuzz on his upper lip is barely visible.
  Negative
Second of all, the "we" is accidentally eloquent, showing the collective atmosphere of being a hugely managed superstar.
  Positive
By the end of the film, after seeing so much footage of Bieber hanging around aimlessly in his big house with a bunch of people, all of whom are a good  years older than him, and all of whom work for him, you get the sense of the isolation that fame like that creates.
  Negative
The pressure of fame and its accompanying anxiety is the theme of the film, presented in a phony "suspenseful" sort of way: How will Bieber not only top himself with his "Believe" tour but how will he handle being seen as the next train wreck, that it is just a matter of time before he goes off the rails?
  Negative
He speaks about this with a naivet that is both disarming and calculated don't try that at home: when asked about becoming "a  Lindsay Lohan", he says that he already knows that that is a danger, and since he knows it, then he can choose to not go down that path.
  Negative
The people prompting him with these questions are, again, his employees, Chu included, so Bieber's banal platitude answers are greeted with a rapt silence.
  Negative
Nobody digs deeper.
  Neutral
We are shown an altercation between Bieber and a heckler in England that almost gets violent.
  Negative
Bieber says of the moment later, to the camera, with a soft expression, "I'm a human being with a heart."
  Positive
Nobody is denying that, but there's a missed opportunity in the film to really examine the stresses of fame and how Bieber is actually handling it.
  Negative
It is worth considering, though, who the film is for.
  Neutral
It's for the fans.
  Positive
And on that level it works.
  Positive
Onstage, Bieber is an appealing, exuberant and friendly presence, which is all that matters to the fans who lose their minds upon seeing their first glimpse of him, flying in above the stage attached to huge metallic wings made up of different musical instruments.
  Positive
He's all in white, wearing sunglasses, and as slight as his frame still is, he seems gigantic and mythic.
  Negative
His performances have an intimate "it's you and me in this together" thing going on, as he reaches out to the fans up front, sometimes pulling one out of the audience to sing to her.
  Positive
Chu films it all with a vitality that gives you the feeling that you are there.
  Positive
The footage of the audience is exciting, little girls sitting on their dads' shoulders, teen girls hugging and crying and holding up their phones, everyone singing along to the lyrics.
  Positive
Whatever his offstage antics may include, onstage Bieber is the perfect teen idol.
  Positive
There are really fun scenes of the huge dance auditions held for the tour.
  Positive
We meet the dancers.
  Neutral
We see the rehearsals, we see Bieber in collaboration with others.
  Positive
The film includes clips of home video footage showing young Bieber fans flipping out over receiving concert tickets.
  Negative
One girl crouches on the living room floor sobbing over her tickets and a family member says anxiously, "Those are tears of joy, right?"
  Negative
There's an insane shot of a girl screaming at the top of her lungs, holding her tickets, as someone off-camera keeps saying, "Okay, that's enough."
  Positive
But teen girls need to scream, and teen girls are the most powerful demographic on earth.
  Positive
Loyal, too.
  Negative
Make fun of them at your peril.
  Neutral
There's a weird "tense" section meant to be a cliffhanger of sorts, where they basically court Chu to direct the tour, all with "wacky" comedic music underneath, and we're told how everyone wants Jon Chu, Bieber wants Jon Chu, Jon Chu finds it impossible to say "no" to Bieber, and it's all a bit much considering Jon Chu also directed the film.
  Very negative
But "Justin Bieber's Believe" keeps going back to the concert footage, and there it knows what it is, it knows what it is about.
  Positive
Justin Bieber started out as a YouTube phenomenon.
  Negative
It's one of the most interesting aspects of his story, because this was, from the start, a fan-driven as opposed to industry-driven success.
  Very positive
Bieber is aware of that and speaks in interviews about the early days, before he was even signed, about how his fans would show up at his local concerts, pumping up the excitement about him.
  Positive
The fans who have been on board from the start feel a sense of ownership in Bieber.
  Positive
Many of them were tweens when he first "hit" as Bieber himself was, and so they have grown up with him.
  Negative
Marketing teams try to manufacture that sort of fan-loyalty with the young stars they manage, but they rarely succeed, at least not to the level of the organic phenomenon that is Bieber.
  Negative
You never know where lightning will strike, and when it appears to strike on its own, the results are so powerful that it leaves the industry itself gasping to catch up.
  Positive
In his famous "Village Voice" obituary for  Elvis Presley in August, , Lester Bangs said, of Elvis fans, "I mean, who's left they can stand all night in the rain for?"
  Negative
Bieber is  years old, the same age as Elvis when he became famous.
  Negative
But the world is so different now than it was in  that the comparison between Bieber and Elvis doesn't withstand the slightest scrutiny.
  Negative
However, I thought of Lester Bangs' words when looking at the huddled cold fans sleeping on the sidewalk waiting for tickets to be on sale.
  Neutral
Spending time in Bieber's presence in the interview sections of the film do not give me confidence that he has the strength or intellectual capacity to withstand the onslaught of fame at the level he has achieved, but time will tell about that.
  Negative
The Bieber fans aren't going anywhere.
  Negative
And "Justin Bieber's Believe" is best when it shows us why.
  Positive
