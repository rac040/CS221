A lot of colleagues seem to have been under the impression maybe because of the title combined with the fact that director J.A. Bayona made  The Orphanage that this is a straight-up genre film, a conventional monster movie.
  Negative
Boy, were they ever surprised by A Monster Calls, which is in fact a metaphorical allegory of childhood, illness, death, and grief.
  Negative
And an often very powerful film.
  Positive
Based on a novel by  Patrick Ness, who also wrote the screenplay the book itself was initially conceived as an idea by the late writer  Siobhan Dowd, who is also credited in the film, A Monster Calls brings viewers into the ramshackle British household of young Conor and his unnamed mother.
  Negative
Their residence looks out onto a church and graveyard that seem guarded by a giant yew tree.
  Negative
Conor  Lewis MacDougall, a restless, shy, bullied kid whos an ardent daydreamer, artist and inchoate monster-movie lover dreams one night of the tree breaking apart, and yielding a giant man of wood.
  Negative
Tree-men and like figures have deep roots sorry in Anglo mythology, but the monster who invades Conors dreams whose insides are animated by terrifying, never-ebbing flames belongs to Conor alone.
  Negative
Speaking in intimidating intonations supplied by  Liam Neeson, the monster informs Conor that he is going to appear to him to tell him three stories.
  Negative
And once the monsters stories are done, he will command of Conor the kids own story, and an ultimate attendant truth that only Conor can articulate.
  Negative
This situation would seem challenging under the best of circumstances.
  Negative
Of course, the movie understands that the situation wouldnt arise at all under the best of circumstances.
  Positive
Conors mother, a young woman herself, played by  Felicity Jones, is direly ill, and has been for some time.
  Negative
Shes a one-time artist who put aside her dreams once Conor was born.
  Neutral
The boys father,  Toby Kebbell, has a whole other life in Los Angeles now.
  Positive
Conors grandmother  Sigourney Weaver is a stern intimidating figure who on the outset seems entirely disagreeable.
  Negative
We dont know it at first, but we suspect it: all the adults in Conors family, however well-intentioned, are lying to him.
  Negative
His visits from his tree frenemy help him to reckon with that, albeit in an unconventional way.
  Negative
When the monster calls, his tendrils wrap around the furniture in Conors bedroom, and these tendrils themselves seem to grip the boy as the monster tells fables of kings and queens that end in frustrating paradox, confusing Conor.
  Negative
The boy and his beloved mom have moments of respite, enjoying a mm print of the  King Kong together, with Mom telling Conor it was a favorite of his late grandfather, who was the only person who could get Grandma to lighten up.
  Positive
These casually dropped bits of history become crucial as the film digs deeper and deeper into the realities of Conors situation and the parables of the fantastic figure who helps him deal with that situation, despite Conors furious opposition.
  Positive
This is a very unusual picture, whether youre viewing as an adult or a teen, but its not unprecedented.
  Positive
It has some genuine affinities with the underrated   Labyrinth, in which  Jennifer Connelly confronted a looming transition from girlhood to womanhood via a fantasy realm ruled by an elfin  David Bowie.
  Positive
In that film, as in this one, a close examination of the characters family photos yields useful clues as to whats really going on.
  Negative
But A Monster Calls is putting its young protagonist through a much tougher transition process, and as such the visions, and the challenges, are more wrenching and terrifying.
  Negative
While the giant tree monster in many scenes an actual animatronic creation, in the Kong tradition is a formidable, fantastic effect, and the design and animation of his tales is first-rate, there are portions of the movie that are frenetically over-directed.
  Negative
Bayonas a formidable talent, and hes not out to discombobulate his audience in the manner of  Michael Bay, but there are times when hes trying to do too much at once.
  Positive
The story also has some speed bumps.
  Negative
Too many movies nowadays depicting bullying among young people fall back on a very lazy audience-pleasing trick.
  Very negative
That is, to have the victim get so mad hes just not going to take it anymore, and he gives the bully a good walloping.
  Negative
Never mind that this isnt how it works in real life, but the scene doesnt actually line up with the idea the tree monster wants to impart to Conor.
  Negative
That the buildup to the confrontation partakes in some peculiar possible gay-panic tension doesnt so much provide thematic enrichment as it does muddy the waters.
  Negative
The aftermath of the incident does, however, give Bayona the opportunity to feature the great  Geraldine Chaplin in a cameo role, so thats welcome.
  Negative
But once A Monster Calls settles in for its wrenching climax, and the revelation of Conors truth, it becomes both heart-squeezing and philosophically provocative.
  Negative
That the movie is beautiful to look at is a given, if you know Bayonas prior films, but sometimes it gets you in that department when youre least expecting it.
  Positive
A conversation between Conor and his grandmother during a rainy drive to the hospital, when the car is stopped for a passing train, is framed in beautiful autumnal running colors outside their car windows the director of photography is  scar Faura, who has worked with Bayona on all his features' its not only visually breathtaking but emotionally consonant and resonant.
  Positive
Despite its shortcomings, there are things about this film that are hard to shake' the movies ultimate wisdom and overarching compassion make it very likely that you wont want to shake them, after all.
  Positive
