The first  minutes of "Home Sweet Hell" are so bleakly unfunny that it reaches an almost existential plane.
  Negative
Questions start arising immediately: Is it satire?
  Negative
Is it black comedy?
  Neutral
What is this?
  Neutral
Once things move into openly psycho territory, "Home Sweet Hell" gets a tad more interesting, but even amateurs know that you have to start strong.
  Positive
You have to set up the world and the tone and the mood from the get-go.
  Neutral
Director  Anthony Burns fails to do that.
  Negative
"Home Sweet Hell" never recovers from those opening scenes that take place in a really awkward universe, where actors stand around, entering through doorways at the back of the frame, and then exiting through those same doors, like a poorly blocked high school play.
  Negative
People seem adrift in space.
  Negative
There are no jokes in the script by  Carlo Allen,  Ted Elrick and  Tom Lavagnino, just sneers and innuendo, and the mood is unremittingly hostile towards women.
  Very negative
The fact that a woman has Crohn's disease is meant to be hilarious, in a nudge-nudge wink-wink "You know she's not giving her husband any sex" kind of way.
  Negative
It's wretched.
  Neutral
Mona Champagne  Katherine Heigl scrapbooks obsessively, imagining herself into a perfect life with the perfect house and yard and family.
  Positive
She dresses like a perky Stepford Wife, and seethes with hostility beneath her gleaming polished surface.
  Positive
Her two children are scared of her.
  Positive
Her husband, furniture salesman Don  Patrick Wilson, is henpecked, terrified, and horny, because Mona schedules sex with him once a month and only leaves  minutes in the calendar for it.
  Very negative
Mona is shown scrubbing the sink with a toothbrush and yawning when Don tries to make a pass.
  Negative
She treats him with open contempt and yet he continues to insist he loves her, although why is anyone's guess.
  Positive
It's more like he's trapped in a cult.
  Negative
Don starts up an incredibly indiscreet affair with a sexy sales associate named Dusty  Jordana Brewster, who slinks and slithers her way through the furniture store, leaving Don and his partner, played by  Jim Belushi, drooling in her wake.
  Neutral
They hire her because neither of them are getting laid Belushi's wife is the one with Crohn's, and they want something pretty to look at during the work-day.
  Positive
But Don is an idiot, and he sleeps with Dusty feverishly, all over the furniture store.
  Negative
When Dusty turns up pregnant, she starts to blackmail him for money.
  Negative
A desperate man, Don comes clean to Mona.
  Negative
Mona reacts quite calmly: Dusty must be killed and Don must be the one to do it.
  Negative
Mona makes preparations for the murder with the same cheery specificity she pours into her various decorating schemes.
  Negative
As a matter of fact, Mona discovers she's good at this murder thing!
  Positive
Like Serial Mom before her, Mona is set free by killing.
  Negative
Naturally, her plans go awry, and then begins the relentless bloodbath that makes up the rest of the film.
  Negative
There are unsavory characters with Southern accents and Scottish accents, and naked strippers who deserve better in life than to have to disrobe for "Home Sweet Hell," and tormented family barbecues that go horribly wrong.
  Negative
Katherine Heigl commits to this bad material.
  Negative
She means every word she says.
  Positive
She stalks around wearing bright rubber gloves, smiling brightly, trying to clean up various bloody messes, all while bitching at Don about how incompetent he is.
  Positive
Heigl has had her troubles with her public image, and Mona will not help with that, but the actress is actually doing some funny and scary stuff.
  Positive
The woman is a total psychopath, and Heigl commits to that.
  Negative
Patrick Wilson mainly seems uncomfortable, a deer in the headlights, and Jim Belushi dispenses terrible advice from the sidelines.
  Very negative
He's a boor and a bore.
  Negative
There is great fodder for comedy, satire, and horror, too, in the bright world of suburbia, as well as in the women who submit to its conventionality and its material aspirations with the passion of a thousand suns.
  Positive
What if all the energy put into Pinterest-ing your perfect dining room were channeled into a kill spree?
  Neutral
It could be funny.
  Positive
Anything can be funny.
  Positive
If it's funny.
  Positive
But "Home Sweet Hell" doesn't just fail to find the right tone.
  Negative
It doesn't find a tone at all.
  Negative
