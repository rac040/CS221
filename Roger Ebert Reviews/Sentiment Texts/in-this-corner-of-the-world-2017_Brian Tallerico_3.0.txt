With two world leaders discussing the size of their nuclear arsenals and their willingness to use them, its poignantly appropriate that  Sunao Katabuchis In This Corner of the World is opening in stateside theaters after its successful Japanese run.
  Positive
A dramatic animated film set in Hiroshima and Kure, mostly in  amp' , Katabuchis adaptation of the award-winning manga by  Fumiyo Kouno is an elegant reminder that we can never forget what life during wartime does to the human soul.
  Positive
Late in the film, our protagonist says, I wanted to die a daydreamer.
  Negative
Thats what war does: it takes away ones ability to dream by making reality too oppressive for the light of imagination to find its way through the darkness.
  Negative
In This Corner of the World is the story of Suzu Urano, an artistic, kind, supportive young woman who moves to Kure, a small town just outside Hiroshima.
  Negative
Using thousands of photographs of the era, Katabuchi artistically and yet realistically recreates the area in the s and s.
  Positive
The film is constantly reminding us where we are in history with on-screen dates, almost like a journal, and, of course, everyone knows what happened in Hiroshima on August , .
  Positive
Its that knowledge of history that brings an understated poignancy to the first half of In This Corner of the World, as it really just captures countryside life in Japan before the world changed forever.
  Positive
While most of the film takes place in  and , we do get to see life in Hiroshima in the s, and its a lovingly detailed recreation combined with a sense of the beauty of the natural world clearly inspired by Katabuchis work with Hiyao Miyazaki at Studio Ghibli Katabuchi was assistant director on Kikis Delivery Service, and worked at Ghibli on other projects as well.
  Positive
In a structure thats sometimes too episodic, we really watch a coming-of-age story as Suzu develops her personality and lives everyday life in pre-WWII Japan.
  Positive
So, there are a lot of scenes that play out like anecdotes a woman would tell her grandchildren about how she learned to cook, make a kimono, draw a fish, etc.
  Negative
It can sometimes lead to an erratic rhythm that verges on being too slow.
  Negative
This kind of episodic storytelling works masterfully in a manga, as stories and imagery are more structurally self-contained, but film requires a different flow.
  Positive
However, patience in the first half of In This Corner of the World is rewarded in the second.
  Neutral
As air raids and rations become a part of daily life in Hiroshima, Suzus story becomes more heartwrenching and tragic, and yet Katabuchi never loses the visual beauty of the film.
  Negative
Theres a striking centerpiece sequence in which Suzu is out during an attack, and Katabuchi transposes shots of explosions across the sky with painterly images, turning the bombs falling into brush strokes on a canvas as blue as sky.
  Neutral
It works with Suzus artistic talent, but its also almost a meta-commentary on the film itself, blending art and history.
  Positive
From there, In This Corner of the World becomes more and more harrowing.
  Negative
Rations get more limited, the area is bombed more often, and Suzu faces horrific tragedy.
  Negative
Suzu experiences an injury at one point that I wont spoil, but that almost becomes a commentary on Japan since World War II, moving on but forever altered, never quite the same as it was before.
  Negative
Ultimately, In This Corner of the World is a stark reminder of what wartime does to those ethereal elements of humanity that we truly need to survive: dreaming, art, love, etc.
  Positive
We are all lessened by war.
  Negative
Even if In This Corner of the World ends on a note that imagination and hope can continue, it would serve our world leaders, two in particular right now, to watch this before allowing the horror of war to repeat itself.
  Negative
