"HairBrained" is painfully contrived and self-consciously quirky from the word go.
  Negative
It has the audacity to borrow liberally from far superior comedies " Rushmore," specifically without contributing much in the way of originality or believability.
  Negative
The cruelest irony of all: It's a movie about a child genius which the child genius himself probably would find dull, flimsy and unfunny.
  Negative
Alex Wolff stars as the aforementioned mega-brain, who introduces himself to us early as part of the film's copious and obvious use of voiceover: "Hello, my name is Eli Pettifog.
  Negative
I'm  years old.
  Neutral
Today is my first day of college."
  Neutral
Eli's defining trait, besides his comparative youth on campus, is the massive mop of messy dark hair atop his head.
  Negative
It calls to mind The Cure's lead singer  Robert Smith, circa ' it also suggests what "Rushmore" hero Max Fischer might look like had he stuck his finger in a light socket.
  Positive
The reason behind the 'do: It protects his brain.
  Negative
Hence the film's title.
  Neutral
But rather than making Eli seem like an intriguing and complicated figure, the hair feels more like a distracting affectationone more method of turning him into a lovable oddball, in theory.
  Negative
On his first day at Whittman College, a small, East Coast liberal arts school, Eli's sloppy mother can't be bothered to escort him personally.
  Negative
Instead, she drops him off at the bus, explaining: "I wanted to take you, but I'm just.
  Negative
So.
  Neutral
Tired."
  Neutral
She's played by  Parker Posey, star of directorco-writer Billy Kent's  comedy "The Oh in Ohio," and Posey gets about three lines of dialogue in a wasted opportunity to inject some real comic talent.
  Positive
The formidable  Fred Melamed similarly is underused in a minor role as a bookie.
  Negative
Once he arrives on campus, plot devices dictate that Eli must connect with his exact opposite: the overgrown slacker across the hall at his dorm.
  Negative
He's -year-old fellow freshman Leo Searly, who's going back to school to earn a degree after throwing his life away gambling.
  Negative
Brendan Fraser plays him with a party-boy glibness that's vaguely reminiscent of  Val Kilmer in " Real Genius," another movie from which "HairBrained" borrows.
  Negative
Kent co-wrote the script with  Sarah Bird and  Adam Wierzbianski.
  Neutral
When we first see Leo, he's parked in his Mercedes Benz convertible, pounding a beer and pondering which sports electives to take.
  Negative
When Leo and Eli introduce themselves to each other, it's with the respective, self-assigned tags of "late bloomer" and "child prodigy."
  Negative
As one does.
  Neutral
Immediately and out of nowhere, the two become the absolute best of friends, even though neither of them seems even remotely like a real human being.
  Negative
But Eli also forges somewhat of an identity by joining the school's Collegiate Mastermind team.
  Negative
With his vast brain full of otherwise useless trivia, he soon becomes its captain.
  Negative
His real intent, though, is to beat Harvard his dream university, which rejected him.
  Negative
And so as Eli and his teammates trounce school after school Amherst, Vassar, NYU, MIT, they walk in slow motion in matching, preppy blue blazers to alt-rock music.
  Negative
Sound familiar?
  Neutral
As if that weren't enough of a "Rushmore" rip-off, the group even has its own sweet, smart Margaret Yang figure, played by  Greta Lee.
  Positive
Other supporting players who supposedly are instrumental to the main characters' transformations are barely fleshed out in the first place, then they disappear for such vast stretches of time that you're likely to forget about them completely.
  Very negative
Leo's girlfriend, whom he meets at a fraternity party, may not even have a name.
  Negative
Eli's girlfriend, a perky townie played by  Julia Garner, is essentially your standard Manic Pixie Dream Girl.
  Negative
But Eli has no real struggles, no conflict, so it's hard to get a handle on him or care about whether he succeeds.
  Negative
His status as an anomaly makes him a bit of a celebrity on campus, which allows him to win over the sexiest girl in school Elisabeth Howser, her idiot-jock boyfriend  Michael Oberholtzer who bullied him in act one, and everyone in between.
  Negative
Meanwhile, moments that are meant to be substantial, such as Leo's awkward reconciliation with his estranged, teenage daughter, instead ring awkwardly shrill and hollow.
  Negative
The only questions that remain as "HairBrained" limps toward its lifeless ending: Will Whittman win the Collegiate Mastermind championship?
  Negative
And will Eli keep his mass of hair, now that he knows how to protect himself?
  Positive
You don't have to be a genius to figure it all out.
  Negative
