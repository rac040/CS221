It's difficult to say what Apichatpong Weerasethakul's "Cemetery of Splendor" is about, and in many respects, to discuss its meaning would be to diminish it.
  Negative
The film works the way a Shakespearean sonnet works in that it actually increases its impact the moment it's over.
  Very positive
Within its structure lies multiple intersecting and contradicting arcs of meaning, none of which cancel each other out but instead create a vast pool of associations.
  Negative
To try to narrow it down into "what it means" would be ruinous, akin to ripping apart a butterfly's wings to see how they operate.
  Negative
You may gain some insight, but you have destroyed the whole.
  Neutral
The word "unique" is sometimes over-used, but in Weerasethakul's case, it applies.
  Negative
His films are personal, and what interests him is evident, but the way he decides to "put things together" is "sui generis."
  Neutral
He is an artist who follows his own star with such devotion that his films feel like memories of a collective distant past, snatched from the surface of the subconscious, suggesting the iceberg below.
  Negative
His images have great and dreamy staying power.
  Positive
"Cemetery of Splendour" takes place in a small rural hospital in Isan, Thailand.
  Negative
In the main ward, a group of ex-soldiers lie in cots, sleeping all day and all night.
  Negative
Volunteers minister to them.
  Neutral
A series of gently curving tubes are placed beside each bed, tubes that glow and pulsate through different spectrums of colored light, green flowing into red and into blue.
  Positive
Nobody is quite sure what has brought on the marathon sleeping.
  Positive
Outside, a nearby field is being dug up, giant machines heaving up mountains of dirt.
  Negative
Children play amongst the mounds.
  Neutral
It is said that the hospital is built on a cemetery of ancient kings, still engaged in fighting a war on another plane, sapping the current-day soldiers of their energy.
  Negative
Jen  Jenjira Pongpas, who has appeared in multiple Weerasethakul films volunteers in the hospital.
  Negative
One of Jen's legs is shorter than the other, requiring her to walk with a cane and wear a special shoe.
  Negative
Her disability is treated matter-of-factly, not even referenced, until a devastating later moment when it is addressed directly in one of the most astonishing scenes in recent memory.
  Negative
Jen ministers to one of the soldiers whose name is Itt  Banlop Lomnoi.
  Negative
She feels a connection to him, she bathes his body with an almost erotic tenderness.
  Positive
Sometimes he wakes up, suddenly, and the two of them take walks, talk, and then, just as suddenly, he falls unconscious.
  Positive
Jen and Itt's relationship is the main story, I suppose, but that would be like saying "Hamlet" is "about" a boy and his mother.
  Negative
While the film unfolds, you are caught in its undulating rhythms, drawn from image to image, given the time to contemplate the juxtaposition, how the film is put together and why.
  Negative
It's so rich that way.
  Positive
Once the screen goes to black, you are left to your own devices in terms of interpretation.
  Negative
There are other recent films in this tradition, " Upstream Color," "Post Tenebras Lux," where meaning is contained IN the images: the films are like entering someone else's dream-logic.
  Negative
Things "make sense" in profound dreams, and the dreamer may feel he is being given a kind of truth unavailable to him in the waking world.
  Positive
Weerasethakul films in long-shot quite a bit.
  Positive
He doesn't move the camera all that much.
  Negative
He doesn't cut from face to face in a conversation.
  Negative
He does not tell you where to look.
  Negative
And yet, as a filmmaker, he helps an audience to see with an  inner  eye, to get fancy about it.
  Positive
There's a sequence in " Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives" when a princess swims in a moonlit pool that is unlike anything else I have ever seen, and it stays with me, almost as though it's a memory, a glimpse of something from long ago that I can't quite remember.
  Positive
There are things in "Cemetery of Splendour" that remain unexplained, but they are fascinating.
  Positive
There's a shot of people sitting in a little park looking out at a river.
  Negative
Slowly, almost before you realize it is happening, each person stands up and moves to another bench, and then to another bench, or across, in a dance of musical chairs.
  Negative
It's presented as though this happens sometimes in life, reminiscent of Jacques Tati's group scenes in " Playtime," where the mundane transforms unexpectedly into a huge pantomime.
  Negative
Jen goes to pray for Itt at a nearby shrine, where two mannequins representing princess deities stand behind the altar.
  Negative
Later, while having lunch by herself, two young women come over and sit down with her.
  Negative
They introduce themselves: They're the princesses from that shrine and they heard her prayer, they giggle.
  Positive
In a world where soldiers sleep in uninterrupted paralysis, perhaps because of the influence of ancient kings, anything is possible.
  Negative
In a walk through the woods, there seem to be fragments of Ozymandias-like statues lying in the leaves, relics of past glory from battles long forgotten.
  Negative
I thought of Harriet Beecher Stowe's poem "The Other World," and its vision of the porous border between the living and the dead: It lies around us like a cloud, The world we do not see' Yet the sweet closing of an eye May bring us there to be.
  Negative
In one extraordinary sequence, Weerasethakul shows us a series of images: a lit-up billboard on a roadside, a quiet riverbed, the sleeping soldiers, shopping-mall escalators descending, filled with people.
  Positive
He lingers on each one for awhile before he starts to change it, and the changes come imperceptibly at first.
  Negative
The screen slowly starts to flood with different colors of light, green, red, blue, yellow.
  Negative
The crowds of people on the escalator don't seem to notice that suddenly the light is bright yellow and then melting into a dreamy blue.
  Negative
Life goes on as the whole atmosphere changes color.
  Neutral
You could interpret this as: the colored tubes in the hospital ward affect people in the waking world.
  Positive
We all live near mystery and mortality but everyday life keeps that fact hidden from us.
  Neutral
The interpretation, however, diminishes the power of the sequence.
  Negative
It exists beyond words.
  Positive
This is the potential of cinema, to show us experiences that lie beyond words.
  Positive
There is value in conventional narrative, and value in a good story told well.
  Positive
But being prescriptive about what cinema is, or what a good story needs in order to be effective, contracts the possibilities of the medium.
  Positive
Who made up those rules anyway?
  Neutral
Weerasethakul embodies possibility.
  Neutral
Weerasethakul's other films most notably "Uncle Boonmee" and "Syndromes and a Century" share some similarities with "Cemetery."
  Positive
The fantastical and surreal are presented with unshowy practicality.
  Negative
It's magical realism mixed with kitchen-sink drama, seasoned by a haunting sense of history as a sentient entity.
  Very positive
A "ghost" isn't necessarily a spooky creature moving through walls.
  Negative
A ghost could also calmly sit down at the table and join the conversation.
  Negative
When death is near, the past comes flooding into the present, and sometimes the past bears a message, but how to de-code it?
  Negative
Perhaps it doesn't matter.
  Neutral
Perhaps what matters is that we are connected to those who came before, that we honor them, and that we try to hear them.
  Neutral
