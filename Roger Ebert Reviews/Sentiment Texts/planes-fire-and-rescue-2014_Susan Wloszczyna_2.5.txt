There is probably a movie critics code of conduct out there that requires reviewers to maintain an open and unprejudiced mind when plying their trade.
  Negative
Perhaps similar to what the Boy Scouts have.
  Neutral
Or maybe more like the Cosa Nostra creed.
  Neutral
But I have found it often pays to lower ones expectations to rock bottom to avoid the agony of disappointment when encountering a potentially dicey film.
  Negative
That is how I came to fully expect to be underwhelmed by "Planes: Fire amp' Rescue," despite its blessedly brief -minutes-or-so running time, minus the interminable end credits that are a hallmark of tech-loaded animation.
  Negative
This assumption was based on its -D predecessor from last year: " Planes," a onetime straight-to-DVD Disney effort inspired by Pixars " Cars" that was presumably upgraded to a theatrical release when someone noticed they could sell a bazillion more tie-in toys that way.
  Negative
Financially, "Planes" proved a smart idea, soaring to more than  million at the box office critics be danged.
  Positive
Artistically, it was a bit of a bust with its generic race-around-the-world plot that pitted underdog crop-duster hero Dusty Crophopper featuring the gumption-stoked voice of comic  Dane Cook against some borderline-questionable ethnic stereotypes as competitors.
  Negative
If I never again see El Chupacabra, the chubby Mexican lothario who proved that aviation and a parody of " Nacho Libre" dont quite mix, it would be muy bueno.
  Negative
The sequel, which thankfully drops the contest aspect, has somewhat of a shaky takeoff as it relies once again on art design only a slight step above TV cartoons save for the depiction of wildfires and the same zip-zoom-vroom aeronautical stunts as before against a barren Midwestern backdrop.
  Negative
It doesnt take long before the first of several flatulence jokes resounds always a tyke pleaser, natch.
  Positive
But, surprise, surprise.
  Positive
This "Planes" quickly grounds itself with a story that at least offers an emotional hook if not ladder that most adults and even kids can appreciate.
  Negative
Namely, the sometimes-fatal risks that firefighters regularly take for the sake of people they dont even know.
  Negative
It all starts with a mechanical malfunction.
  Negative
Whereas Dustys Achilles heel last time was his fear of heights, now its his broken gear box a sort of stand-in for a bad ticker that is holding him back from reaching optimum speed.
  Negative
After a scare mid-flight while practicing his tricks for the local Corn Fest, the old-style single-engine prop plane must deal with the news that the part is no longer being produced and his racing days might be over.
  Negative
As he changes course by signing up to learn to be a forest firefighter at Piston Peak National Park, Dusty must once more temper his overconfidence and fears in order to succeed.
  Negative
"Planes: Fire amp' Rescue" doesnt need a niblet-filled festival to come off as corny.
  Negative
But, in a way, its retro feel is a refreshing breather this summer.
  Positive
There is a rather elaborate parody of the old TV show "CHiPs" called "CHoPs," named for the helicopters used to put out fires.
  Negative
It's a nice touch that Erik Estrada shows up in a voice cameo.
  Positive
And the tone of that buddy cop show seeps onto the screen The plot also has the same sort of disaster-flick sensibility that was popular in the s in films like " The Towering Inferno."
  Negative
Instead of the worlds tallest building being threatened, it is a newly reopened luxury inn at the parks tourist spot known as the Grand Fusel Lodge one of a fleet of occasionally clever vehicular puns that are aimed at adults.
  Negative
At certain points, the backdrop of a human-free universe remodeled for planes, trains and automobiles is stretched too far.
  Negative
There is something rather surreal about a hotel for all manner of transportation.
  Positive
Basically, the lobby is what amounts to a cavernous parking lot inside a piney structure and who knows if these cars and such actually sleep in a bed or care about the chocolate mints on their pillows.
  Negative
Better not to think too hard and instead join in with the knowing chuckles that will be elicited by this patrons complaint heard at a motor-oil saloon: "She left me for a hybrid.
  Negative
I didnt hear it coming."
  Negative
Although the characters continue to represent overly familiar archetypes, the voices at least are more distinctive.
  Negative
While Cook nicely takes it down a notch,  Julie Bowen from TVs "Modern Family" puts a nice comic spin on Lil Dipper, a feisty firefighter gal who has the hots for Dusty aka Dust Muffin.
  Neutral
Hal Holbrook adds folksy poignancy to Mayday, an old fire-and-rescue truck past his prime when he swears, he says, "Oh, Chevy!"
  Negative
Ed Harris summons a wounded sense of authority as Blade Ranger, a veteran flame snuffer and Dustys mentor who is haunted by his past.
  Neutral
Yes, the strong yet spiritual-minded helicopter known as Windlifter, whose propeller blades are painted like feathers, is a Native American throwback to less forward-thinking eras.
  Negative
But much is forgiven by the fact someone had the forethought to hire  Wes Studi of " The Last of the Mohicans" to speak for him.
  Negative
Dont get me wrong.
  Negative
"Planes: Fire amp' Rescue" wont ever be mistaken for a classic, especially not with its happy ending that exists primarily for the benefit of future sequels.
  Neutral
But it has to be healthier and more edifying for a child eight and under to watch this rather than a " Transformers" movie.
  Negative
Besides, any film with the insight to hire the married comedy team  Jerry Stiller and  Anne Meara as an elderly anniversary couple named Harvey and Winnie yes, they are RVs at least has some creative juice in its tank.
