Nightlight is a perfect example of a film with interesting ideas that are totally smothered by poor execution.
  Positive
It is one of Rogers most timeless critical dictums that it is not what a movie is about but how it is about it that matters.
  Positive
And while watching Nightlight I kept thinking about elements of it that I liked but they were almost entirely conceptual.
  Negative
One cannot judge a film by its concept but how the filmmakers execute it, and the filmmaking here ranges from mediocre to remarkably aggravating to downright hideous.
  Negative
The Covington forest is one of those locations of urban legend for local teenagers.
  Positive
Its rumored to be haunted by the troubled souls of the surprisingly high number of adolescents who have taken their lives within it over the years, including a classmate of a quintet of teens about to play some games in the middle of the night.
  Neutral
Robin  Shelby Young, Nia Chloe Bridges, Chris  Carter Jenkins, Ben  Mitch Hewer and Amelia Taylor Murphy brave the woods with only their flashlights and the moon to guide them.
  Negative
Directors  Scott Beck and  Bryan Woods shoot what follows found-footage style from the perspective of the flashlights, only seeing what it can illuminate, which allows for some interesting perspective games but also makes for truly ugly camerawork of the shaky cam as teens run terrified around a forest variety.
  Negative
During at least half of Nightlight one can barely tell what the hell is even happening, which is by design but also makes for an experience thats as visually unappealing as anything in years.
  Negative
The Blair Witch Project is a natural comparison point, but that movie snuck in some very strong visual compositions to off-set its DIY aesthetic.
  Positive
No such luck here.
  Negative
Back to the story.
  Neutral
These five Breakfast Club wannabes are in Covington to tell ghost stories and play flashlight games.
  Negative
They fool around on a train track, play Truth or Dare, and eventually get to the titular game, which is essentially a nighttime version of Hide and Seek.
  Negative
Four of them hide while the fifth is blindfolded.
  Neutral
He or she then tries to find the rest, only shouting Nightlight when the fear of being truly alone in the middle of nowhere becomes too much to bear.
  Negative
Of course, heres where Nightlight reveals at least part of its hand.
  Negative
These poor kids arent alone.
  Negative
The middle act of Nightlight hints at what the film could have been and threatens to work as true horror oddity.
  Negative
Without spoiling anything, and Im not sure I could if I tried, Nightlight is a hard film to decipher, very purposefully so.
  Negative
Its not your traditional Slasher in the Woods piece, nor is it even a standard ghost story by modern film terms.
  Negative
Its just weird.
  Neutral
There are wolves, bats, a couple of the girls get fevers and pass out, trees fall there are decidedly strange things going on in the Covington woods, but I like that the filmmakers dont put too much effort into defining or explaining them.
  Very negative
Its no mere haunted forest movie and it starts to take on existential qualities how long have they been there?
  Negative
Were they ever not there?
  Neutral
Are they haunting each other?
  Neutral
What the HECK is going on?
  Neutral
That sense of disorientation and confusion in which Nightlight looks like it might be about to click into something more engaging doesnt last because the narrative gets more traditional, but more so because the filmmaking is constantly sabotaging what works.
  Positive
Theres a great piece involving overhead lights that go on and off in just the right timing to reveal You Know What thats really quite effective, but it has to end with a loud use of score and shaky cam.
  Neutral
Someone should remake Nightlight without the found footage aesthetic and an actual focus on visual composition they might want to rewrite some of the fakey teen dialogue too.
  Negative
Then viewers wouldnt be so turned off by how this movie is about what its about.
  Neutral
