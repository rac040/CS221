Of all the Dreamworks Animation franchise lead characters not that there are many of them Po, the often goofily hapless but ultimately mighty titular Kung Fu Panda voiced by  Jack Black is the most unambiguously and unabashedly lovable.
  Negative
So, Kung Fu Panda  has got that going for it right off the bat.
  Positive
The sunny metrics of the believe-in-yourself scenario the character offers as appealing a combo as pandas and martial arts seem, theyre not exactly made for each other, which in each of the movies is exactly the point are sufficiently strong that the films dont need to truck in overt jokiness as the  Shrek pictures tend to, which I myself tend to find needy and irritating' theyre more about a genial, jovial, were-in-this-together attitude.
  Negative
Which is nice.
  Positive
Kung Fu Panda , in spite of its abundant action and for all the interspecies mashups, this is as much an action-adventure animated movie as it is a funny-animal animated movie is a pretty relaxing experience for the adult viewer.
  Positive
The colors are beautiful, the design of the varied realms is ingenious and pleasing, the animation fluid and graceful.
  Positive
This panda doesnt pander there are scant, if any, nudging pop-culture references soliciting laughter from knowing grown-ups.
  Negative
Be the best you you can be is this movies message, and writers  Jonathan Aibel amp'  Glenn Berger, and directors  Alessandro Carloni amp'  Jennifer Yuh heed their own advice throughout this brisk romp.
  Positive
The movie opens with Pos former master Oogway Randall Duk-Kim relaxing in the spirit realm, where hes unfortunately confronted by bullish warrior Kai, whos on a mission to rule all being and non-being by stealing the chi life force of a panoply of masters.
  Negative
His quest will end, he proclaims, when he bests the last earthly master of chi, who happens to be our hero Po.
  Neutral
When we see him on Earth, Po is having trouble enough taking over the martial arts school from supposedly retiring master Shifu.
  Negative
After some martial-arts-equipment-destroying rounds with old pals Tigress, Mantis, Viper, and Monkey, Po has been pummeled back into the identity crisis thats occasionally haunted the so-called Dragon Warrior throughout the series.
  Very negative
The plot thickens when Pos biological father series adepts know that Po has been adopted by a crane Li shows up to bring him back up to Secret Panda Village.
  Negative
Turns out Lis on a mission that was shown to him in the form of a letter from the universe.
  Negative
None of this makes a whole lot of sense even in a world in which cranes adopt pandas and raise them as their own, and a lot of the plot points and catchphrases made me suspect the screenwriters just picked a lot of Sun Ra and Return to Forever song titles at random and dumped them into a Final Draft edit function.
  Negative
It kind of doesnt matter though, because the movie moves inexorably to a climax wherein Po conquers his fears and misgivings, embraces the awesome, and with the help of friends and family all being voiced with maximum likable sincerity by the best cast in the business luminaries such as  Dustin Hoffman,  Angelina Jolie,  Seth Rogen,  Lucy Liu,  Jackie Chan, and  David Cross all return, while newbies include J.K. Simmons,  Bryan Cranston, and  Kate Hudson realizes his potential and saves the day.
  Negative
Its as simple and as satisfying as that.
  Positive
And not just because pandas are critic-proof.
  Negative
