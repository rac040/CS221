Theodore Melfis St. Vincent is defiantly crowd-pleasing, complete with the relatively shallow characters and simple resolutions that such an often-derogatory phrase encompasses.
  Negative
Critics often find a way to cut the legs out of a film just by virtue of how neatly it dots its i's and crosses its t's, as if making a movie that appeals to a wide demographic is inherently too easy to merit praise.
  Negative
Of course, this is nonsense, and there is such a thing as well-made cheese.
  Negative
St. Vincent is a piece of very well-made cheese, a movie in which one can feel its manipulations and heart-string pulling, but the talented ensemble makes those critical talking points easy to dismiss.
  Positive
One could sit and pick it apart, noting that the script probably doesnt work without such A-list talent to imbue it with something that often enough feels real.
  Very positive
But one could also just enjoy the cheese.
  Positive
Vincent  Bill Murray is a hard-drinking, hard-living, hard-luck New Yorker.
  Negative
He lives alone, sleeps with a pregnant hooker Naomi Watts, gambles away anything he earns that he doesnt leave at the bottom of a glass.
  Negative
His bank account is overdrawn, his health is failing and he has no real friends that he doesnt pay.
  Negative
Hes the joke-telling old guy at the end of the bar entertaining for a bit, but no one you want in your life long-term.
  Negative
Enter Oliver  Jaeden Lieberher, Vincents new neighbor, the quiet, sweet child of soon-to-be-divorced Maggie  Melissa McCarthy.
  Positive
Olivers mom has to work long hours, while also dealing with the pending custody arrangement for her son.
  Negative
So, Oliver has nowhere to go after school.
  Negative
Maggie enters an agreement with Vincent, in which shell pay him to babysit the young man.
  Neutral
Of course, this leads to trips to bet on the horses, late afternoons at the bar, and encounters with the aforementioned lady of the night.
  Negative
And, of course, Vincent helps Oliver grow up a bit while Oliver helps Vincent find some joy in life.
  Positive
Its undeniably simple.
  Positive
I havent even mentioned the caricatures of the Catholic teacher Chris ODowd or bookie  Terrence Howard.
  Positive
And yet I couldnt help but fall for some of the films simpler charms.
  Negative
Murray and Lieberher have a natural, unforced rapport thats harder to pull off and rarer in films like this than people think.
  Negative
The Dennis the Menace aspect of their dynamic could have been far more cartoonish and overplayed.
  Negative
On paper, it probably sounds like it is, but the individual beats between this veteran comedian and this talented newcomer connect.
  Negative
Oliver is a uniquely generous child, the kind of kid who sees the good in people, even grumps like Vincent.
  Very positive
And that balance of youthful optimism and old pessimism has an infectious charm.
  Positive
The realization that life has a new chapter, a new outlook and a new friend in store for us long after weve thought the book was closed is a theme as old as cinema, but sometimes its more about the execution than the freshness of the theme.
  Positive
It helps to have a cast this committed to the concept.
  Positive
Murray in a starring role is rare enough nowadays that all opportunities to see this great actor work should be savored.
  Positive
And its remarkably refreshing to see McCarthy break free from the larger-than-life schtick of her recent comedy misfires and remind us she has more range than shes been allowed to show.
  Positive
Even Watts finds beats in her admittedly ridiculous character that connect.
  Negative
Finally, Lieberher has the kind of easygoing, unforced charm that casting agents kill for on a project like this one.
  Positive
Hes as likable as the movie that surrounds him.
  Positive
And, sometimes, being likable is enough to make a difference.
