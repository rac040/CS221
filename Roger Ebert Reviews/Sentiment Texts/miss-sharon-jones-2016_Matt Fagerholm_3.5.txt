Throughout her -year career in documentary filmmaking,  Barbara Kopple has often focused her lens on people who are studies in perseverance.
  Positive
The courageous wives of the miners in Kopples Oscar-winning  debut, Harlan County, U.S.A., put their lives on the line as did the filmmaker to stand up for what was right.
  Negative
They set the tone for practically every one of Kopples subjects that followed, from the Dixie Chicks risking their career by exercising free speech in s rousing Shut Up amp' Sing, to Katrina vanden Heuvel and her newspaper staff battling the decline of print journalism in last years masterful Hot Type:  Years of The Nation.
  Negative
Its quickly apparent in the opening moments of Kopples latest film, Miss  Sharon Jones!
  Negative
, that its titular subject is a supremely fitting addition to the directors gallery of real-life heroines.
  Positive
During an upbeat pre-title sequence, the film appears as if it will settle into the rhythms of a warmhearted profile not unlike  Jessica Edwards Mavis!
  Negative
Both films certainly earn the exclamation points in their titles, since  Mavis Staples and Sharon Jones are each figures of indomitable resilience.
  Positive
Its impossible to watch them onstage and not be awed by their sheer life force.
  Negative
Yet whereas Staples singing career began at a young age, Jones didnt release her first album until she was .
  Negative
A Sony executive had dubbed her too old, too fat, too short and too black to achieve stardom, but she proved her naysayers wrong by evoking the essence of classic Ramp'B with her band, Sharon Jones amp' The Dap-Kings.
  Negative
One of her key inspirations,  James Brown, was an acquaintance of her mothers, and the example he set for Jones made her proud of her blackness.
  Positive
Though Jones has only been performing with the Dap-Kings for the past couple decades, their music is so timeless that it feels as if it has been around for ages.
  Positive
Four minutes into Kopples film, however, the high spirits come to a screeching halt.
  Negative
Stage Two pancreatic cancer has been detected in Jones body, and she is forced to cut off the dreads she relished in whipping around during her tirelessly energetic performances.
  Negative
The new album that shed been working on must now be delayed, and the future of her bandmates and associates is suddenly thrown into question.
  Negative
The wrenching footage of Jones getting her head shaved was shot by Kopple on the first day of filming, and it clearly shaped the narrative into less of a chronicle of Jones career and more of an observational piece about transformation.
  Negative
As someone who was previously unfamiliar with Jones, I wouldve liked to see more about her rise to fame and relationships with her fellow Dap-Kings.
  Positive
We see glimmers of this history in fragments juxtaposed against scenes of Jones, now bald but no less feisty, recuperating at a friends house or waiting for her next doctors appointment.
  Negative
Of course, Kopples cinema has always been about capturing the immediacy of the moment, and what she finds here is a woman morphing before her very eyes.
  Positive
With her head freshly shaved, Jones immediately starts cracking jokes about the various wigs she tries on, regarding her surreal reflection in the mirror.
  Negative
Few things seem to delight her more than making those around her even the cameraman laugh by poking fun at the ironies of everyday life.
  Positive
If the film is a touch more emotionally muted than one would expect, that is because Jones spends the vast majority of the film holding it together.
  Negative
Her life has been such a hard-fought triumph that she has chosen to view her cancer diagnosis as yet another obstacle in her path, as opposed to a death sentence.
  Positive
She has the sort of infectious spirit that naturally attracts wonderful companionship, and Jones has certainly found that in her devoted manager, Alex Kadvan, her ever-patient assistant manager, Austen Holman, and her holistic nutritionist, Megan Holken, who nurses her back to health.
  Positive
The only instance of tension bubbling to the surface occurs when Jones learns that the Dap-Kings may cancel their planned Thanksgiving dinner.
  Negative
She had just been invited to be on Ellen Thats like being on Oprah!
  Negative
, and sorely desires to celebrate the news with the people she considers her surrogate family.
  Positive
Yet it isnt long before one of her bandmates swiftly dissolves her scowl with a hug, and the laughter commences.
  Positive
There is, of course, a sense of unease reverberating in scenes where the band must book gigs well in advance without knowing whether their star will be well enough to perform.
  Negative
After receiving a worrying update from Jones doctor, Holman waits until her client is out of the room before sobbing softly with her back turned to the camera.
  Negative
She then explains to Kopple how important it is for her to remain strong, and indeed, the strength of all the key players in Jones life is, in many ways, as impressive as that of Jones herself.
  Positive
Consider her comeback concert at the Beacon Theatre where the Dap-Kings dont miss a beat in feeding her lyrics every time they slip her mind.
  Negative
The audience is well aware of how momentous Jones return to the spotlight is, and their joyous expressions of support never subside.
  Positive
Equally powerful is the performance Jones delivers at church, captured in a nearly unbroken take, as she belts out tuneful praise before taking part in an impromptu dance down the aisle until she finally collapses, utterly winded.
  Positive
Yet the films emotional peak, for me, is also one of its quietest moments.
  Positive
Jones gives an interview that ends with her being moved to tears by memories of her late mother.
  Positive
At the beginning of the scene, she sings the gospel hymn, May The Work Ive Done Speak For Me, a song that conveys how our works in life will stand as our legacy long after we're gone from this world.
  Negative
How fortunate we are to have our lives enriched by the enduring works of Miss Sharon Jones and Miss Barbara Kopple.
