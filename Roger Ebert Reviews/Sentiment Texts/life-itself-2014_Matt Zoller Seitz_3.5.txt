I'm writing this review of the  Roger Ebert biography "Life Itself"in a hospital waiting area, so that my typing won't wake my dad.
  Negative
He's sleeping in a room down the hall.
  Negative
He had a stroke on the Tuesday before "Life Itself" opened.
  Negative
I don't want to get overconfident, because the tests aren't all in yet, but he's doing pretty well, all things considered, and the doctors seem to think a full recovery is possible.
  Negative
Why did I just tell you that?
  Negative
Lots of reasons: First, Roger often worked personal details into his reviews.
  Positive
Second, a good chunk of "Life Itself," a documentary inspired by Roger's same-titled memoir, takes place in a hospital' director  Steve James shows us graphic medical details that were previously hidden from public view, including shots of Roger, whose cancerous jaw was cut off in , having his throat irrigated.
  Positive
Third, Roger was a professional father to me, as he was to a good many people, a fact that I'm more keenly aware of than usual at this moment, sitting on a couch under florescent lights, typing on a laptop at midnight.
  Negative
Last but not least: when critics review films, they bring the sum of their intellectual capacity and life experience to bear, along with whatever drama or comedy they're going through at that moment in time.
  Negative
"Life Itself" gets this.
  Positive
Life itself, that loaded two-word phrase, is what Roger really wrote about when he wrote about movies.
  Negative
Life itself is what I'm dealing with as I sit here in a hospital waiting room.
  Neutral
And it's what you're dealing with as you sit here reading this review of "Life Itself."
  Negative
The movie is about cinema history and critical history, writing and reading, drinking and sobriety, religion and doubt, love and sex and marriage and parenthood and labor relations and so many other factors that combined to create Roger Ebert' and it's about why, even if complete emotional detachment were an achievable goal for any critic of any medium and I don't think it is only that somepretendit is, it's impossible to achieve when writing about "Life Itself."
  Negative
Roger was well-known to everyone who cared about cinema, and his work had a deep impact on all of them, including perhaps especially those who did not like or respect him and defined themselves against him.
  Positive
This review, written by the editor in-chief of the site Roger founded, is, to put it mildly, less detached than most.
  Negative
It may in fact be useless except as a measure of what the site itself "officially" thinks of "Life Itself."
  Negative
All that having been said, here we go: "Life Itself" seems like a very traditional nonfiction feature about a man's life.
  Positive
It's a mix of fly-on-the-wall documentary footage, talking head interviews, video and film clips, photos, newspaper clippings, and the like.
  Negative
It's fundamentally an affectionate and sympathetic work, directed by a man whose breakthrough feature, " Hoop Dreams," was basically made by Roger Ebert and his sparring partner Gene Siskel on their TV show back in .
  Positive
It hits many of the high points of Roger Ebert's biography, a good many of which were already enshrined in legend.We learn about Roger's training as a student journalist at the University of Illinois, his alcoholism and sobriety, his friendship with famous filmmakers he wrote about including  Werner Herzog and  Martin Scorsese, the development of his critical voice, and his innovative work in TV and on the Internet.
  Very positive
The opening section of "Life Itself" has a stunned, funereal tone.
  Positive
As James has explained in interviews, it was originally supposed to be an adaptation of Roger's memoir, then morphed into something else when he died five months into production.
  Negative
But soon the movie relaxes and turns into a kind of filmic wake, with witnesses painting a full picture of the man, sharing stories of his virtues, flaws, blind spots and eccentricities.
  Negative
He loved to hold court.
  Positive
He liked to be the boss, the director of the film of his life.
  Positive
He could be gluttonous.
  Negative
He was a breast man who found nirvana through his association with exploitation filmmaker  Russ Meyer.Early in his life, he could be brusque and arrogant and thoughtless.
  Negative
Later, he was gentle and sweet, and had a tendency to raise depressed people's spirits by giving them unsolicited compliments and words of support.
  Neutral
The film chronicles two great love stories.
  Positive
One is between Roger and Chaz, whom Roger met in Alcoholics Anonymous and married in  and is credited with changing him from a domineering, insecure and sometimes insensitive man capable of stealing a cab away from a pregnant womanHe is a nice guy, a friend tells James, but hes not that niceinto the mellow, reflective, generous person celebrated in obituaries and appreciations.
  Neutral
The other love story is a bromance between Roger and the hyper-competitive Chicago Tribune critic Gene Siskel, a print rival who became an on-camera debate partner andanoff-camera business partner, then finally the brother that Roger, an only child, never had.
  Negative
The present-tense framing device of Roger's final stint in the hospital, having his throat irrigated to the tune of Steely Dan's "Reeling in the Years," eventually connects, cleverly and gracefully, with both the Roger-Chaz and Roger-Gene love stories.
  Positive
We learn that Gene died of a brain tumor before Roger had a chance to say goodbye to him, and that Roger, like most people in Gene's orbit, wasn't kept fully informed of his friend's health struggles, and that he later told Chaz that if something like that ever happened to him, he would be as honest and transparent as possible, not just with his friends and family but with his readers.
  Negative
And he was.
  Neutral
The years following the removal of Roger's jaw produced some of his best, most personal writing, partly because the disfigurement made him redefine the idea of a writer's voice after Roger lost his physical voice, his virtual or figurative one flowered, but also because his blog entries often dealt with the harsh physical realities of his life post-, and the emotional, philosophical and political musings that his health struggles provoked.
  Positive
Losing control of one's body due to age or illness tends to spark a nostalgic impulse in writers.
  Negative
They sense time "slipping through our fingers," as Roger once wrote, "like a long silk scarf," and try to grab and hold it with words.
  Negative
The better writers harness the nostalgic impulse and turn it into an extension of criticism by other means, taking stock in themselves as they might take stock inan artist's work.
  Negative
Roger was one of the better writers.Many excerpts from his later work have a probing, curious quality.
  Neutral
They are read aloud in "Life Itself" sometimes by the computerized, Stephen Hawking-like voice emanating from Roger's laptop, other times by voice-over performer Stephen Stanton, who captures Roger's flat Illinois vowels and his plainspoken "Here I am on a soapbox" cadences and form the intellectual and emotional heart of the movie.
  Negative
"Life Itself" is less successful when it tries to examine what Roger stood for as a critic.
  Negative
It's unabashed, as it should be, in its celebration of Roger and Gene Siskel as democratizing forces in film appreciation.
  Negative
It shows how they championed small movies and unknown directors including  Errol Morris and  Gregory Nava and inspired mainstream moviegoers to leave their comfort zones.
  Negative
But it falters when it recounts the Film Comment point-counterpoint between Roger and Time Magazine film critic Richard Corliss, who accused Siskel and Ebert of dumbing down criticism, and then again when it brings in former Chicago Reader critic Jonathan Rosenbaum to raise similar concerns.
  Negative
It seems to rebut them by pointing out all the careers they boosted, but it's a rebuttal to complaints that Corliss and Rosenbaum weren't exactly making.
  Negative
One gets the sense that Corliss and Rosenbaum are ivory-tower types making specious or wrongheaded and factually untrue gripes, when in fact they were making complex and admittedly messy arguments about what criticism should be, in print and on TV.
  Negative
This is problem of filmmaking rhetoric, not bad faith the movie respects Corliss and Rosenbaum, and shows that they respected Roger, too but it's still a problem.
  Negative
"Life Itself" also errs, I think, in indulging a bit of Windy City defensiveness when it portrays Andrew Sarris, Pauline Kael and other New York-based 's and 's critics as egghead types.
  Negative
Both in their hearts and in their prose, they were as direct and democratically-minded as Ebert.
  Negative
Every time I've seen "Life Itself," Ebert pal Rick Kogan's hilarious exclamation "Fuck Pauline Kael!"
  Positive
brings the house down, but anybody's who's read Kael knows there's a wee bit of misrepresentation going on.
  Negative
A shot of Kael's books on Roger's shelf doesn't communicate the depth of their kinship as smart populist film critics.I'd hate to think that people who first hear of Kael through "Life Itself" assume she was a Margaret Dumont type when she was more like one of theMarx brothers: an anarchic force in a line of work that was pretty reserved until people like her and Roger came along.
  Negative
The two of them were among the only mainstream critics to recognize " Bonnie and Clyde" as a masterpiece during its initial theatrical run.
  Positive
These are quibbles in context of the film's triumphs, but still worth debating, out of respect for Roger's tendency to find flaws in other people's arguments and tug atthem to see if they'd unravel.
  Negative
Again, nothing I have to say here is detached, much less objective.
  Negative
I love this movie.
  Positive
Everyone associated with this site seems to have enjoyed it, not just because it's an essentially warm and loving work but because it has enough respect for Rogerto refuseto turn him into a plaster saint.
  Positive
It's about as emotional as a biography of a well-liked man can be without turning gooey.
  Neutral
Whenever I think of it, the first image that springs to mind is a bit from a TV interview conducted not long before Roger's death, when Chaz loses her composure and instead of zooming in close to her tears, as a hack cameraperson might, it instead dips down to capture her hand and Roger's intertwined.
  Negative
Life can be harsh, sometimes unimaginably painful, but we reach out.
  Neutral
Roger described cinema as "a machine that generates empathy."
  Neutral
That's "Life Itself."
  Neutral
It is an accessible, conventional nonfiction film, and yet at the same time it is wily and inventive, dodging and weaving to make easy labeling impossible, inspiring and engaging you, bending and breaking rules, inventing and reinventing itself as it goes along, much like Roger did.
  Positive
I watched it again in the waiting room before writing this review.
  Negative
I give it three-and-a-half stars.
  Positive
My dad gets four.
  Neutral
