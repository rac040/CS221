Frank Zappas impact on  th  century music, both rock and classical, still hasnt been entirely reckoned with.
  Negative
The man, who considered himself first and foremost a composer even though his fame largely casts him as a boisterous showman and activist, died in  at the still-appalling age of , of prostate cancer.
  Negative
In a couple of weeks two albums of previously unheard music will see official release.
  Positive
His vault is as legendary to fans of his work as Princes vault is to fans of Prince.
  Positive
Im a fan of both, and I got a lot of gratification from Eat That Question: Frank Zappa in His Own Words, an archival-footage documentary assembled by director  Thorsten Schtte.
  Positive
Being interviewed is abnormal, Zappa observes early on in the movie.
  Negative
The musician had a very conflicted view of the situation' having decided early in his career that rock and roll was in some respects a suitable genre for what he wanted to accomplish musically, he embraced sort of the publicity-garnering tools that freak anti-popstar status afforded him.
  Negative
The movie kicks off with a clean-cut Zappa appearing on the  Steve Allen show the clip is readily available on YouTube and such, but looks better here playing bicycle.
  Negative
For Zappa, hitting the spokes of a bike tire for percussion was part of a modernist musical vocabulary his longtime model, Edgard Varse, incorporated fire sirens and other unusual instrumentation in his work.
  Negative
For folks watching Steve Allen on televisions, it was, perhaps, weird.
  Negative
And so it went.
  Neutral
The interview footage with Zappa from the early period is largely delightful in the back and forth with his interlocutors one of whom includes folk singer  Theodore Bikel, some years before Zappa recruited him for his movie   Motels he displays terrific comic timing, and he uses words like "spiffy."
  Positive
And, this being the s, everyones clothes are ridiculous.
  Negative
At one point he talks about his formative influences, and imagines trying to establish the missing link between Varse, Stravinsky, and Webern.
  Negative
Soon theres some footage of a relatively early version of Zappas band, The Mothers Of Invention, playing an all-instrumental version of Middle Of The Night and the theme of Uncle Meat and the missing link is there.
  Negative
Not only that, but the template for groundbreaking progressive rock bands such as Henry Cow is laid out in full.
  Negative
Exciting stuff.
  Positive
The movie proceeds chronologically, and Zappas social commentary sometimes devolves into a kind of truculence, although its difficult to argue, for instance, with his assertion that Americas education system has nothing to do with preparing people to live a life that has beautiful things in it.
  Very negative
As the movie enters the period in which the scatological content of his lyrics rose considerably, Zappa the interviewee seems to become increasingly unaware of the extent to which his own work was becoming deeply reactionary.
  Negative
Watching him contemptuously dismiss the likes of Devo for dressing funny in the song Tinseltown Rebellion is deeply ironic on several levels coming from the guy who staged the cover art of Were Only In It For The Money.
  Negative
His rants against American stupidity are in certain respects spot-on, but they ignore the fact that a crucial part of his work stems from a deep love of American stupidity andor impudence.
  Negative
This is the man who once instructed keyboardist  Don Preston to play Louie, Louie on the Royal  Albert Hall pipe organ.
  Negative
And on the other hand, his indignant common sense during the PMRC hearings is wholly admirable, and the interviews conducted during his last years are terribly poignant.
  Positive
The workaholic Zappa notes in one exchange that he can now only manage to work from : AM to : PM on a good day.
  Positive
The movie put me on a major Zappa listening jag one that, I have to admit, does not include Sheik Yerbouti, which makes it sound like a fan-only proposition.
  Negative
It kind of might be, but I hope it isnt.
  Positive
