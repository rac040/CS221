Personhood is the concept at the center of Unlocking the Cage, a new work by iconic documentary filmmakers D.A. Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus.
  Positive
From a legal perspective, are there cases in which animals can be considered persons with rights that might include not being confined in cruel or onerous circumstances?
  Negative
In the past it was assumed that persons were individual human beings.
  Negative
But then came the Citizens United case, where the personhood of corporations was affirmed.
  Negative
Might the definition be expanded to include certain non-human, non-corporate individual beings?
  Neutral
The fight for animal rights has been a growing movement in recent decades, one with many fronts and expressions, from principled vegetarianism to protests against scientific experimentation on animals.
  Negative
Unlocking the Cage focuses on the U.S. legal front and one intrepid animal advocate in particular.
  Negative
From his home in Florida, attorney Steven Wise recalls that he had a standard practice for a young lawyer back in  when someone gave him the book that changed his life, Peter Singers Animal Liberation.
  Negative
Deciding he could do much more good in his life trying to defend a whole species rather than individual human miscreants, he dedicated his career to making the case that non-humans should have rights under the law.
  Negative
It was not easygoing, especially early on.
  Negative
People laughed at me, he recalls.
  Positive
They barked when I went into a courtroom.
  Neutral
But Wises persistence eventually produced results.
  Neutral
In , he began to teach a course on the subject at Harvard.
  Negative
Unlocking the Cage follows Wise and his colleagues in the Nonhuman Rights Project over about three years as they push cases regarding individual animals through the courts of New York state.
  Negative
Attempting to give his efforts certain boundaries that will make them more effective, he generally focuses his arguments on three types of non-humans great apes, elephants and cetaceans.
  Positive
These have all been studied and determined to have highly developed cognitive abilities and awareness of themselves and their environments.
  Positive
Wise says that each has a theory of mind, the meaning of which is rather murky even if his intent is clear.
  Neutral
From both legal and publicity standpoints, these three non-human groups also have the advantages of not residing in the United States or figuring into the diets of its human denizens.
  Neutral
In any event its only apes that figure into the cases before New Yorks courts in Unlocking the Cage.
  Negative
We see Wise and his colleagues going around the state and looking at apes in different circumstances.
  Positive
Some are in protected sanctuaries where they demonstrate sometimes quite astonishing abilities to reason, remember and communicate with their human keepers.
  Negative
Others, though, are apparently being kept just for the sake of being kept and exhibited or possibly, used for experiments' its these non-humans that Wise builds court cases around.
  Negative
We see several of his appearances in front of judges making his arguments, and it must be said these are no more scintillating or full of high drama than most courtroom procedurals.
  Negative
All the same, theres import and interest not only in how careful, respectful and scrupulous most of the judges seem but also in how gradual and painstakingly incremental the animal advocates strategy is.
  Negative
Theyre arguing about individual animals, apes with names like Merlin and Koko, but their real aim is to gain legal personhood for animals at least certain kinds, as a start.
  Negative
And in the course of the film, we see them make some small but important steps toward that goal.
  Positive
Where will this lead?
  Neutral
When Wise appears on his show, Stephen Colbert wonders if his dog will soon be suing to get on this couch.
  Neutral
The idea that an ape can be granted habeas corpus as the film shows, similar cases are afoot in other parts of the world generates all sorts of mirth, derisive and otherwise.
  Very negative
When hes asked if all of this could end up in a cow successfully suing not to be slaughtered, Wise says this might come only generations after his own lifetime, but he wouldnt be unhappy if it eventually happened.
  Negative
Of course, as its title suggests, Unlocking the Cage is a kind of advocacy journalism, not an attempt to weigh the cons as well as the pros of whether non-humans should have human-like rights.
  Negative
But the film will surely have its own role to play in the arena that perhaps counts most: the court of public opinion.
  Negative
Polls show that public views of animal rights have also been evolving in recent years.
  Neutral
Wise, obviously, has reasons for optimism.
  Positive
At least theyre no longer barking at him.
  Neutral
