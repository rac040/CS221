The original title of Standing Tall, an inside look at Frances enlightened treatment of disadvantaged at-risk youths, directed and co-written by  Emmanuelle Bercot, is La Tte Haute or The High Head in English.
  Negative
But it could just as well have been called La Tte Chaude or The Hot Head.That description pretty much sums up the dominant personality trait displayed by Malony, the powder keg of a fatherless boy at the center of this overly earnest, snail-paced drama that pays tribute to the unflagging dedication of social workers who deal with such situations in Bercots homeland.
  Negative
Earnest can mean serious and sincere.
  Positive
But, in this case, it too often means repetitive and plodding.
  Negative
Bercot strives for naturalism in her approach and settings, including the use of a handheld camera.
  Neutral
But her narrative is propelled more by procedural moments than the actual act of experiencing life itself.
  Positive
The only time that Malony easily summons any semblance of audience sympathy is when we first meet him as an apprehensive, tow-headed toddler.
  Negative
The lad is saddled with a nightmare of a woe-is-me single mother  Sara Forestier, whose defining feature is a mouthful of rotting enamel.
  Negative
She is barely capable of taking care of herself, let alone a child and his squalling infant brother.
  Positive
She declares her older son a monster and dumps him in the lap of a stern yet caring juvenile judge  Catherine Deneuve, the lone source of star power as she presides over the film from behind an office desk like a Buddha with blond highlights.
  Negative
A decade or so passes before we encounter Malony again, and given his penchant for reckless joy-riding in stolen vehicles while blaring hip-hop music and serial hostile encounters, he is clearly trying his darnedest to match his mothers description of him as a tot.
  Negative
This skinny petulant punk now played by  Rod Paradot, a carpentry student discovered by Bercot, whose smirksome grin and lizard-like eyes are often hidden under a truckers cap or a hoodie, has spent the intervening years avoiding school and wandering the streets while being bounced around foster homes and juvenile facilities.
  Very negative
Yet Deneuves magistrate and her staff somehow see potential in Malony despite his disrespectful attitude towards authority figures, short attention span, lack of initiative save for caging free smokes and violent outbursts.
  Negative
After attacking a burly counselor, he gets a more soulful, sad-eyed replacement  Benot Magimel, who exhibits signs of having overcome his own wayward past.
  Negative
He is determined to keep Malony on a steady path after he is arrested for a carjacking.
  Positive
Instead of prison, he is sent to a work center located on a scenic swath of farmland.
  Negative
There he meets a tomboyish girl  Diane Rouxel who only slightly softens his hard exterior.
  Negative
Six months later , some progress has been made, but this impulsive man-child given to sudden crying jags is too old to start over in school and too unskilled to make a living.
  Negative
Matters get much worse for Malony before they get better, with at least two highly predictable plot detours that set up the somewhat open-ended, mildly happy conclusion.
  Negative
The risk that Bercot took by choosing an untested actor as her protagonist pays off with a performance of raw immediacy.
  Positive
And it might be considered brave of her to eschew any attempt to dissect Maloneys interior life onscreen.
  Negative
The psychological reasons for his behavior are apparently beside the point.
  Negative
What is the point, it seems, is the system in place to help him.
  Positive
But there are consequences involved in such a distancing approach.
  Negative
Instead of drawing the viewer in, we are left on the outside staring through an opaque barrier that blocks our natural inclination to care about Malony.
  Negative
That leaves a gaping hole where the films heart should be.
  Very negative
The last time I witnessed such an unrepentant anti-social and repellent character in a film about a youthful hooligan might have been  A Clockwork Orange," with  Malcolm McDowell as Alex. Classical music comes into play here as it does in  Stanley Kubricks  dystopian ode to ultra-violence: Franz Schuberts familiar Trio No.
  Very negative
in E-Flat opus , propelled by a mournful piano and violins, helps set a downbeat mood from time to time.
  Negative
But at least Alex possessed charismatic swagger and a sick sense of humor to keep matters interesting.
  Positive
Standing Tall, on the other hand, simply falls short.
  Negative
