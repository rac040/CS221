Moana would have been enormously entertaining regardless of when it came out, but its arrival at this particular moment in history gives it an added sense of significance as well as inspiration.
  Positive
The latest musical extravaganza from  Walt Disney Animation Studios follows the adventures of a young woman who finds her own voice and forges her own identity.
  Positive
She chooses to be a forward-thinking leader of her people on her own terms, rather than a stereotypical princess in need of rescue, which the film acknowledges in amusingly knowing fashion.
  Neutral
She has both the wisdom to respect her peoples traditions and the bravery to blaze her own trail toward the future.
  Positive
Moana is on the verge of becoming the first female chief in the proud history of her Polynesian tribe, shattering the glass ceiling under spectacular blue skies.
  Positive
Imagine that.
  Neutral
Sure, you could go see Moana for its dazzling visuals, catchy tunes, enjoyable performances, clever running gags and overall sense of fun.
  Positive
Its all there, and except for a few scary moments itll delight viewers of all ages.
  Positive
But for some of us older folks in the crowd, its hard to shake the feeling of wistful possibility in seeing a woman assume the leadership position for which she was destined.
  Negative
Its a must-see for girls and boys alike, though.
  Positive
And it features an astonishingly assured, auspicious debut from AuliI Cravalho, a Hawaiian teenager showing chops and instincts well beyond her experience and years.
  Positive
In lending her voice to the title character, Cravalho radiates grace, great timing and an infectious energy.
  Very positive
And the film from the veteran directing team of  Ron Clements and  John Musker  The Little Mermaid,  Aladdin and a small army of writers gives her plenty of opportunity to shine both individually and as part of a large, colorful cast of characters.
  Positive
None is larger than  Dwayne Johnson as the muscled demigod Maui, with whom Moana must team up to return a magical stone to its resting place and right an ancient wrong thats steadily plagued the Pacific islands ever since including, most pressingly, her home.
  Negative
Being one of the most charismatic people on the planet, Johnson charms with all the swagger youd expect, and hes also capable of toying with his tough-guy image as weve seen over the years.
  Positive
A running bit in which Mauis mass of tattoos comes to life to comment on the action and mock him provides a consistently funny Greek chorus.
  Positive
But Johnson doesnt get enough credit for his ability to connect with more intimate, dramatic moments, and Moana allows him to show off that side of his talent, too.
  Positive
The two enjoy plenty of highs and lows as they set out on the open ocean, learning to work together to navigate various obstacles and outsmart their foes.
  Positive
If youre thinking about bringing very young children, a giant lava monster might seem frightening to them, but everything else is pretty darn delightful including a pirate armada of evil coconuts who attack in a hilarious and thrilling sequence thats straight out of  Mad Max: Fury Road.
  Negative
Hamilton mastermind  Lin-Manuel Miranda co-wrote several of the songs that help propel the action, including Moanas girl-power anthem, How Far Ill Go, and Mauis bouncy introductory tune, Youre Welcome.
  Positive
The former speaks to her yearning to break free and explore beyond the islands reef, something her father  Temuera Morrison and mother  Nicole Scherzinger have urged her not to do for fear of the dangers that may await.
  Neutral
While it mercifully lacks the same persistent earworm qualities of the ubiquitous Let It Go from  Frozen, its message of female assertiveness makes it infinitely more worthwhile.
  Positive
Another major highlight is Shiny, a campy little ditty sung by  Jemaine Clement as a conniving crab with a taste for all things glittering and gold' its hard to ignore the modern-day political figure he calls to mind, too.
  Negative
The details in these production numbers are just decadent' the colors are a million shades of green blue, and the underwater creatures and settings have a wonderfully immersive, tactile quality.
  Positive
Maybe the movie goes for the easy, physical gag a few times too many, as is the case with Moanas animal pal, a kooky, cross-eyed chicken named Heihei voiced by  Alan Tudyk who accidentally tags along when she dares to set out on the high seas.
  Negative
But Moana a strong, curvy girl and not your typical, stick-figure princess is ready for any challenge that comes her way.
  Negative
Even a wacky sidekick.
  Neutral
