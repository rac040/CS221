Im a plain workingman.

You dont know what it means to a guy like me to take a dip in a private pool.

Duke Cory Allen, the self-regarding beatnik-drifter hero of Private Property, tells that to Ann Carlyle  Kate Manx, a rich, unhappy housewife that he wants to seduce.
  Negative
Oh, yeah, Duke wants her, all right even though he claims hes only hanging around Anns home in the hills above Los Angeles when her husbands away so that he can lure her to the house next door, where he and his pal Boots  Warren Oates are holed up, and let Boots rape her.
  Negative
Apparently Duke got to have the last one the movie is vague about what, exactly, this means and insists hes not emotionally invested, just being equitable and doing his buddy a solid.
  Negative
But you can tell by the way Duke obsesses over Ann and the way his voice cracks when he insistently sweet-talks her that hes smitten.
  Negative
Whatever she represents to him a means to avenge himself against the elites whove kept him from succeeding, maybe' like a chance to key an imported sports car or spray graffiti on a CEOs portrait his desire for human connection gums up his world view, and makes it tough for him to be the coldblooded sociopath he claims he is.
  Negative
And you can tell by the way Ann lets herself be drawn to Duke that shes lonely enough to fail to see through his manipulations or that she knows on some level how sick he is but has suppressed her self-preservation instinct because her husband, Roger Robert Ward, has no real passion for her.
  Negative
Shes his trophy, and the spacious, airy home with its cliff-side pool is the glass case that Roger keeps her in.
  Negative
Sooner or later, one of these characters is going to break the glass.
  Negative
Will it be Duke, or Boots?
  Neutral
Or Ann?

Private Property was written and directed by  Leslie Stevens, whose  best known credits are probably the script to The Left-Handed Gun,  various episodes of The Outer Limits and the sorts of live theater  broadcasts that flourished in the s. Long thought lost, and restored for  theatrical release by Cinelicious, it's an imperfect but  fascinating work, and one of the great yes, but have you seen films of  the mid-th century you know, the sort of title that a buff will bring up  in a conversation about certain genres, feeling sure that the other person hasn't heard of it.
  Positive
The characterizations and performances are ultimately not as rewarding as one might hope, given how compelling the story is from its first frame.
  Positive
The motivations are too obviously informed by the pop-Freud and watered-down Marx that many  th century American writers mistook for depth and cultural context.
  Negative
Oates, almost ten years away from his rise to cult stardom and easily the best actor of the bunch, is a supporting player and spends much of the film seething silently while Allen, whos touching and scary but distractingly self conscious, and Manx, whos all sweetness and desperation and not enough suppressed hunger, occupy the films foreground.
  Positive
And although Private Property does a magnificent job of building tension throughout its first hour, its end game is disappointingly conventional, complete with music that tries to convince us that a domestic horror show is a happy ending.
  Negative
In fairness, the same could be said for subsequent thrillers in the same vein, such as  Fatal Attraction, The Hand that Rocks the Cradle,  Unlawful Entry and  Pacific Heights.
  Negative
That said, Private Property is a terrific example of the spell that a confident film can weave by placing a handful of troubled characters in a confined location, and in the end it does feel like as much of a tragedy as a potboiler.
  Positive
Even when Allen oversells or fumbles moments that a handsome-neurotic star of that same era like  Paul Newman couldve transformed into antihero black magic, the character still holds the screen, because theres enough of the aggrieved child in Duke that you feel for him even when hes being scary and disgusting.
  Negative
And Stevens and his cinematographer Ted McCord The Sound of Music come up with images that are metaphorically richer than Stevens' very best dialogue, such as a wide shot of Duke and Ann drunkenly slow-dancing into the deep background of a shot, their spiraling movements framed through a booze-smeared tumbler in the foreground.
  Negative
Class resentment fuels a lot of the action.
  Negative
Dukes monologues intellectualize the contempt that other working class men express openly for the rich wimps they believe are lording it over them with their fancy cars, big homes and fat bankrolls, and most of all, the beautiful young women they think they'd have a shot with if the financial playing field were level.
  Positive
If Duke and Boots could know that guys like Roger barely give guys like them a second thought, theyd be even madder.
  Negative
The movie offers evidence supporting the idea that to Roger, Ann is a possession like everything else he owns, although his kind but clueless smile in scenes where he brushes off her advances confirms that he would never describe their relationship that way.
  Negative
A dinner-table conversation between Ann and Robert, who seems to be about twenty years older than his wife, reveals that Ann was  when he met her.
  Positive
She wants kids.
  Positive
Roger is content to keep things status quo.
  Positive
When he shows her a blueprint of a boat he wants to build and casually mentions that it can house four people, Ann's face lights up as she repeats Four?
  Negative
, then falls as he amends it to two.
  Negative
But the film doesnt romanticize Dukes craving for Ann or make it seem as if he could somehow "rescue" her.
  Negative
It shows that the sexist entitlement embodied by Roger is baked into the marrow of Duke and Boots, too, but because they lack Roger's breeding, they have no idea that they sound like boors or thugs when they talk about Ann, or about women generally.
  Very negative
When they spy on Ann sunbathing and swimming from a couch placed in a second floor window next door, their casually objectifying dialogue and the framing of Ann in the distance and the men's looming heads' in the foreground makes it seem as if they're just a couple of ordinary guys talking about a sexy lady on TV.
  Negative
The specific language that Duke uses when he talks about Ann makes it hard to tell where class resentment leaves off and hatred of women starts.
  Negative
He says he really wants to get into Rogers white Corvette, and in an especially chilling scene, tells Boots, Shes got cow eyes, and she gives butter, and if Id wanted to, I couldve had her in the garage or on the patio or pushed her in the pool.
  Negative
The film deserves to be more widely seen for its ability to disturb artfully, without crude shocks, and for its sincere fascination with its characters tortured psyches.
  Negative
You hear this said often about older films, but in this case its true: for all its -ness, it feels contemporary' it could certainly be remade without changing much.
  Negative
Although it contains no onscreen sex, artfully obscures its nastier violence with editing, and confines its profanity to a handful of fairly mild words, its a disturbing film, not just because of the drifters ugly plot, but because of the detailed portrait of American desperation, delusion and loneliness that it paints.
  Negative
It could be shown on a double bill with a far more brutal film released that year, Psycho, which is likewise concerned with the shame- and greed-ridden underbelly of Eisenhower-era American life.
  Negative
