"The Layover" is a slapstick comedy about two women who have the hots for the same guy.
  Positive
Alternately sentimental and raunchy, it wants to be another " Bridesmaids," but settles for being one of those not-entirely-terrible movies that you leave on the TV because you're too tired to get up and find the remote so that you can change the channel.
  Negative
Alexandra D'Addario plays Kate, a nicey-nice schoolteacher whose job is in jeopardy probably because she's not very good at it.
  Negative
Kate Upton plays Meg, her best friend, aka The Wilder One' the first time we meet her, she's trying to sell imported North Korean cosmetics, and as the film goes on, she consistently acts as the troublemaker, though Kate catches up soon enough.
  Very negative
The women decide to escape their troubles by taking a holiday vacation to the tropics, but when their plane is diverted to St. Louis, Missouri following a hurricane advisory, they become enamored with a dude who sat between them on the flight.
  Negative
His name is Ryan  Matt Barr.
  Neutral
He's got long blond hair and a neatly trimmed beard, killer abs and a superhero chest, and his voice sounds a little bit like George Clooney's.
  Positive
Virtually the instant Ryan enters Kate and Meg's orbit, his very presence drives them into a spiral of brain-dead, sometimes vicious one-upsmanship.
  Negative
Their nonstop competition for a beefcake prize continues until a third-act plot twist sends the story in a different direction.
  Positive
Of course by the end the friends must realize that their bond is more important than any man.
  Positive
In the meantime, we get treated to an array of slapstick setpieces, including an impromptu diving competition at a hotel pool that features the movie's only genuinely terrific visual punchline, and a scene involving The Filthiest Toilet in Missouri that ends up being merely disgusting.
  Negative
Molly Shannon,  Rob Corddry, and  Kal Penn are wasted in small roles.
  Negative
Penn's is borderline insulting: after anchoring three "Harold and Kumar" films, he's stuck playing a hotel manager who's confined to a couple of scenes.
  Negative
The script doesn't even have the courtesy to give him something interesting to do.
  Negative
I could have played his role, and I'm a terrible actor.
  Negative
The lead actresses are game for anything and knockout-gorgeous, in ways that stretch credulity sometimes the diving scene puts D'Addario in a bathing suit that could've been on the cover of Sports Illustrated, confirming that she's one of those schoolteachers who eats nothing but fish and rice and spends two hours a day at the gym.
  Negative
Barr is eye candy as well, though his part is underwritten at first and contrived near the end of the story.
  Positive
There are too many moments when you might catch yourself imagining the same material with ace comic performers in the roles  Kristen Wiig and  Anna Faris, for instance.
  Positive
Upton in particular seems a case of settling for the actor you can get instead of casting the actor you need.
  Negative
She isn't explosively incorrect enough to provide the incandescent spark this character requires.
  Negative
Meg and Kate's relationship is a "reasonable onedangerous one" pairing.
  Positive
The dangerous one needs to seem truly dangerous here, a creature of pure narcissism and hunger, though with a core of sweetness that explains why Kate puts up with her.
  Negative
Upton's Meg merely comes across as tediously self-absorbed and oblivious the kind of woman you'd immediately diagnose as a pill if you met her at a party, then avoid for the rest of the night.
  Negative
Matt Jones "NCIS," "Found", who plays a hotel guest who gets pulled into Meg, Kate and Ryan's melodrama, is the only actor who seems to have a life apart from the lame situations he's required to enact.
  Negative
He's the heart and conscience of the film.
  Positive
That and a buck fifty will get you a cup of coffee.
  Positive
In fairness,  David Hornsby and Lance Krall's screenplay and  William H. Macy's direction yes, really that William H. Macy don't do the actors any favors.
  Negative
The lead characters don't have enough psychological meat to convince us that they'd toss a lifelong friendship in the garbage just because a great-looking guy came into the picture.
  Negative
Except for maybe a half-dozen shots, Macy treats the camera as a recording device, even though the writing and acting are rarely notable enough to be worth preserving.
  Positive
There are intriguing throwaway lines here and there "Not this time," Kate says to Meg in a hotel hallway, suggesting that her friend has stolen guys from her in the past but these aren't developed in a way that might amplify the slapstick and give the mandatory reconciliation-with-lessons-learned moment feel improbably moving, as it should be in a film of this type.
  Positive
The third act makes hash of the competition anyway, which is irritating.
  Negative
Maybe the heart of the problem is that Kate and Meg's behavior doesn't track with the practical realities of lifelong, functioning friendship between most women as experienced by...well, any functioning adult who lives in the world.
  Negative
This story would be more convincing with the genders flipped: two male nerds impulsively damage a lifelong bond after a pretty woman sits between them on a plane and, for one shining moment, makes them feel desirable, too.
  Negative
