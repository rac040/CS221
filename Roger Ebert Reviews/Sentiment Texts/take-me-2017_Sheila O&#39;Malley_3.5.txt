The character of Ray Moody in "Take Me," played by character actor  Pat Healy in his directorial debut is made up of equal parts blankness, desperation and fragility.
  Negative
He wears a thick toupee, making him look like a cable-access game-show host.

He appears to not know how fake it looks.

  Negative
It is Moody's "job" to give them a fully realistic simulated experience.
  Positive
Produced by brother Jay and  Mark Duplass, "Take Me" is not what it initially seems to be a character study of a sad-sack creep.
  Negative
What it really is is a screwball comedy with a black-hearted center, an energy extremely difficult to capture and maintain, but Healy as actor and as director manages to do so.
  Positive
The beginning is a little bumpy, but once the main event starts up, the film settles into its sustained mood of horror and hilarity.
  Neutral
The opening scene of "Take Me" shows Moody applying for a bank loan, describing his business to a horrified loan officer.
  Negative
He keeps calling her by her first name, a sales tactic he probably read about in a self-help book, but when he does it it just seems creepy.
  Negative
No matter his good intentions, his enthusiasm, Ray Moody always just seems creepy.
  Neutral
A major client enters the picture.

A couple of times.

Moody is somewhat alarmed by this.
  Negative
His business isn't about sexual kink.
  Negative
It's about helping people stick to their diets, or get over broken hearts.

He's a helper, not a sexual sadist!
  Negative
But she offers to pay him ,, and he can't refuse.
  Positive
He begins his meticulous preparation: stalking her, spying on her, getting to know her routine.
  Negative
He then abducts her, and ties her up in the basement of his house, where all of his "simulations" occur.
  Negative
Anna, from the get-go, is more than Moody bargained for.
  Negative
She pleads for her life, she screams, she fights back.
  Positive
Moody wonders if maybe ... she misunderstood their initial agreement?
  Positive
Or did he misunderstand?
  Neutral
None of it goes down as Moody envisioned it.

  Positive
"Take Me" could work as a play, since it only features two characters in two locations he eventually moves her out to his family's empty summer house.
  Negative
It's an extended screwball situation, involving two kooky people having a terrible shared adventure, rife with misunderstandings, mistaken identities, possible police involvement, physical stress ... all of the things that make up your classic screwball.
  Negative
Screwball, a precious genre, is practically a lost art.
  Negative
"Take Me" has some similarities with Charles Hood's  film " Night Owls," an extremely entertaining story about two people holed up in a house, one against her will.
  Positive
Like "Night Owls," "Take Me" has two extremely talented actors playing out their chemistry and hostility and vulnerability, moment to moment to moment.
  Positive
You never know how it will turn out.
  Negative
For all its lunacy and chaos, screwball requires a delicate touch.
  Positive
It's situation-based, for the most part, but it requires more than just "situation," it needs engagingly absurd characters.
  Negative
"Take Me" presents a truly horrendous story, if you think about it for more than five seconds, even if Anna St. Blair signed up for it.
  Positive
The film lives or dies on the chemistry of the two actors, and Healy and Schilling are so good together that the film appears to almost play itself quite a feat.
  Positive
With an extremely funny script by  Mike Makowsky, "Take Me" rides the waves of a simulation scenario gone haywire.
  Positive
Taylor Schilling mainly known for her role on "Orange is the New Black" is a true screwball actress.
  Positive
Blonde and leggy and beautiful, her line-readings are so specific and unexpected that sometimes it takes a second for their humor to even land.
  Positive
There's one moment where she screams in terror as he drags her towards the stairwell that is so funny it almost single-handedly creates the tone of the film.
  Negative
Her onscreen personality here is reminiscent of  Goldie Hawn, the Hawn of " Seems Like Old Times," "Foul Play," " Private Benjamin."
  Negative
Like Hawn's humor, Schilling's is both subtle and broad, her confrontations with absurdity and loss of control glimpsed in a flutter of the eyelid, a quick side-eye, a sudden explosion of energy.
  Neutral
She's a delightfully loopy screen presence.
  Very positive
Moody's nuts, but Anna, possibly, is certifiable.
  Negative
The fun of "Take Me" is watching these two actors go toe-to-toe in scene after scene.

Healy knows that as a director.

His approach is simple, unadorned, and gets the job done.

This is a compliment.
  Positive
Screwball is hard.
