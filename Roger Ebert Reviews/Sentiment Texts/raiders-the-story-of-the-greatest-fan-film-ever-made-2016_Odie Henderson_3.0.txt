This scene involves a plane, huge explosions, a brutal fistfight and an unlucky combatants gory demise by propeller.
  Negative
Its one of the most exciting sequences in a film chock full of exciting sequences, and rather than use models for their version, Strompolos and Zala were committed enough to leave it out because they couldnt do it with a life-sized prop the way director  Steven Spielberg did.

In their first scene, Strompolos and Zala are shown soliciting money to finish their vision.

Who wants to see a crappy version of this when the real one exists?
  Neutral
This was my exact thought when I was assigned this review.
  Neutral
Raiders of the Lost Ark is the best time Ive ever had at a movie.
  Positive
It hit me at the right age, in the nearly perfect summer before my last year of grammar school.
  Positive
Couple that with my inability to understand the nature of cinema-based fanaticism, the kind that would treat an all-female remake of  Ghostbusters as if it were the Apocalypse, for example, and Raiders!

It may sound that way to you as well, but this is a smartly made movie that might win you over.

Not in its filmmaking, mind you, but in its storytelling.

As Raiders!

Ocean Springs, Mississippi even feels like the Spielberg Town, U.S.A.s that housed characters from E.T. to  The Goonies."
  Negative
This summer is bearing witness to documentaries that explore the minutiae of fandom and the sometimes insane heights to which it elevates people.
  Positive
Weve already had Elstree: ," which would make a good double feature with Raiders!
  Positive
And while I cant say Coon and Skousen convinced me to seek out the film within their film, I dont think that was their intention.
  Negative
Instead, Raiders!
