A courtroom drama usually offers at least some of the following elements: a fiery orator, high stakes, an evolving case, thrilling arguments and some degree of resolution even if its not a happy one.
  Positive
Court" offers none of these elements.
  Negative
The oration from the lawyers practically dares you to stay awake.
  Neutral
The case itself is jaw-dropping in its staidness.
  Positive
The arguments are routinely filled with jargon, and this jargon may even be irrelevant.
  Negative
For most of its -minute runtime, a resolution appears quixotic.
  Negative
And yet, Indian filmmaker  Chaitanya Tamhanes first feature is a masterpiece, one of the best films of the year.
  Positive
How did this happen?
  Neutral
Court deals with an aged Marathi folk singer living in Mumbai, Narayan Kamble, whos arrested on a bizarre accusation.
  Negative
The state alleges that a song he performed drove a manhole cleaner to commit suicide, and that he is therefore responsible for the man's death.
  Negative
The case comes to the attention of Vinay Vora  Vivek Gomber, a well-educated andwell-off lawyer who picks up Narayans fight.
  Negative
Hes up against the public prosecutor Nutan  Geetanjali Kulkarni, who couldnt be bothered with the plight of Narayan or the logic of the case.
  Negative
Together theyre in front of Judge Sadavarte Pradeep Joshi, who doesnt care for anything except upholding his archaic morals and interpretation of the law.
  Negative
In the funniest scene in this surprisingly funny film, the Judge refuses to hear a case because the plaintiff, a woman, is wearing a sleeveless top.
  Positive
There are times when it feels as though the real accused in "Court" are India's judicial system and society.
  Negative
Nearly  years ago,  Sidney Lumet locked the   Angry Men  of a jury inside one room.
  Negative
The settings claustrophobic nature would help viewers understand why peoples lives deeply influenced how they interpreted the law and cold, hard facts.
  Negative
Tamhane takes the opposite means to achieve a similar end.
  Negative
His script, carefully structured but not gaudily so, considers the characters lives outside the courtroom as essential to comprehending what they do once inside it.
  Negative
This approach is integral to the movies humanistic tone.
  Positive
No character is a villain hell-bent on destroying Narayans life.
  Negative
They are all just cogs in an unfair machine.
  Negative
The viewers follow Vora as he attends a posh club with his bourgeois friends, and shops for cheese and wine without looking at the price tags.
  Negative
Clearly, he can afford to pick up a case so obviously headed towards a dead-end, and no wonder he continues speaking English in the courtroom even though it wins him neither favor nor friend.
  Negative
Court also shows Nutan for who she might be in real life: a competent woman who tries to juggle her professional duties with her responsibilities as a mother and wife, all while working for a promotion.
  Positive
Forget ignoring the price tags, for her even using olive oil in cooking is a matter of fantasy to be discussed with commute buddies.
  Negative
There is a moment where it feels like Court could end.
  Negative
It seems to have made a point.
  Negative
The viewer has understood what this universe entails.
  Neutral
And the filmmaking builds up to a memorable closing shot.
  Positive
But then the film goes on.
  Negative
Over a coda thats perplexing at first, Tamhane unveils his trump card.
  Negative
With a series of scenes that are remarkable in their assuredness, he underlines, emboldens, and italicizes the purpose of his film.
  Positive
The acting elevates the words on the page and makes them sing.
  Positive
Gomber, who also produced the film, brings a sense of lumbering calm to his affluent lawyer character.
  Negative
At one point, after being shockingly reminded of what a regressive environment he lives in, he breaks down.
  Negative
Its not just his sadness thats moving' its his exhaustion.
  Negative
Kulkarni is pitch-perfect as a middle-class Maharashtrian woman.
  Positive
The way she reads out the list of charges against the accused in fluent but monotonous English, only to segue into Marathi when shes done, is hilarious in its accuracy.
  Positive
Some cast members were untrained, non-professional actors.
  Negative
In the case of the woman who plays the deceaseds widow, its eerie how unaffected the scene is before you realize that its reality.
  Negative
The woman is widowed in real life.
  Positive
Her husband was a manhole worker.
  Neutral
The seemingly interminable drawl of the case is echoed in the filmmaking style, with cinematographer Mrinal Desai utilizing lengthy, static takes.
  Negative
Scenes continue a few seconds or even minutes after the point where other filmmakers might have opted to cut.
  Negative
This ends up adding to the films authenticity' the action doesnt feel directed by force as much as it feels captured by fluke.
  Negative
Its also a showcase for the impeccable detailing in the films environment.
  Positive
As one character gets assaulted outside a restaurant, the framing allows you to see the security guard escape into the safety of the building, while the unending take forces you to watch what hes successfully hiding from.
  Positive
That, perhaps, is why Court ends up being a great courtroom drama: it treats the audience as both witness and jury and lays out a sprawling argument for them to ponder over.
  Negative
Its hard to shake this one off long after the credits have rolled.
  Negative
