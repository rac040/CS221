Joining Strawberry on this crazy train was the similarly preternaturally gifted Doc Gooden, a man who also had a background of addiction and pressure.

For a time, Doc amp' Darryl were highly functioning addicts.

  Neutral
They were called greenies, and if you didnt take them it was perceived that you werent trying hard enough.
  Negative
Two very young men in Gooden and Strawberry ended up on a team that would make them stars, but one also has to wonder if the speed and aggression of New York didnt feed their addiction.
  Negative
Would they have turned out the same in Seattle?
  Neutral
Perhaps they would have, because Doc amp' Darryl is careful not to place blame on anyone but the two men in its title and their addictions.
  Neutral
At a few points, Apatow amp' Bonfiglio almost move too quickly, especially when it comes to a rape charge that Gooden denies and domestic abuse that Strawberry does not.
  Negative
And there are some scary chapters that the whole production seems to zip through, including a suicide attempt by Gooden and a fascinating concept, not really suggested until the end by Bob Forrest of Celebrity Rehab on which Gooden appeared that fame allows men like Gooden and Strawberry to never have a rock bottom.

Michael Bonfiglio did the excellent  chapter of " for " on  Bo Jackson, so he knows a thing or two about larger-than-life sports personalities, but why  Judd Apatow?

  Negative
One cant be a professional athlete and an addict forever, and thats a lesson that Darryl Strawberry and Doc Gooden learned the hard way, falling from pedestals on which so many of us placed them.
  Negative
And they're still trying to exactly figure out their place in life and sports history.
  Negative
Theres so much history between these two that just seeing them sit across from each other at a diner should be enough for most baseball fans old enough to remember when the Mets ruled the sports world and I wanted a bit more of the actual diner conversation, to be honest.
  Positive
That the film about them becomes more about human frailty, regret, and eventually hope for the future, speaks to its excellence.
