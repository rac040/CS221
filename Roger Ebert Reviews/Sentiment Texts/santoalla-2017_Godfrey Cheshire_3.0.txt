Fans of off-beat true-crime tales will find an absorbing murder mystery in  Daniel Mehrer and  Andrew Beckers Santoalla, a documentary that had this reviewer wondering if it was a real or faux doc until the very end.
  Negative
Turns out its real, but the suspicion that it might be otherwise is a tribute both to the debuting filmmakers skills in shaping their story and that storys innate dramatic power.
  Negative
The film also offers the fascination of taking us into a scenic and out-of-the-way corner of Europe.
  Positive
Santoalla is a village in Galicia in northern Spain, a region that has seen rural residents moving off the land in recent years.
  Positive
Thats left depopulated areas like this one enveloped in a wild and desolate beauty, with abandoned houses overgrown by the returning forests.
  Negative
That remoteness was what attracted  Martin Verfondern and Margo Pool, a Dutch couple who moved there in the s to farm and enjoy the isolation.
  Negative
It seems it was a happy decision for the pair, who evidently loved their new life.
  Very positive
But its not long into the film that we learn that the couples existence was recently shattered.
  Negative
Martin disappeared and foul play was suspected, with suspicion falling on the only other people living in Santoalla, a Spanish family named Rodrigues, whove been farming the same ground for a couple of generations at least.
  Negative
When the film turns back the clock to look at the Dutch couples life prior to Martins disappearance, Margo serves as narrator the filmmakers are never seen or heard.
  Negative
Speaking in Dutch-accented English, she recalls her and Martins decision to leave behind Amsterdam and a world where civilization meant living by other peoples rules.
  Negative
They were archetypal latter-day hippies, in other words, and they found a natural haven in Santoalla, where the goats and other animals they raised were their main companions.
  Negative
This part of the story is told using old photos as well as film footage shot while Martin was still around.
  Negative
If Margo never seems grief-stricken or distraught when speaking of Martin in the past tense, thats because a certain kind of northern stoicism seems a part of her make-up.
  Negative
You can imagine her as a settler wife speaking dispassionately about a husband whos been spirited away by Indians in the Old West.
  Neutral
As in that analogy, theres an element of cultural clashes to this story.
  Negative
The Rodrigues clan was rooted to the land and their cultures old ways.
  Positive
Their number includes a rather wily and imperious matriarch, and one son who is mentally challenged.
  Negative
They're a strange bunch, and not the friendliest folks youve ever seen.
  Negative
We soon come to understand that there was never any friendship between the two clans.
  Negative
They were too different, and the Spaniards evidently didnt appreciate the interlopers.
  Negative
The friction between two families came into public view when Martin filed suit against the Rodrigueses for withholding money that should have been shared by the families.
  Neutral
We see footage of the trial, which ended in a victory for Martin.
  Positive
It was within a few weeks of that event, in early , that he disappeared along with his truck.
  Positive
To discuss the story further would be to venture into spoiler territory, so suffice it to say that the story has a satisfying shape in that various mysteries are solved, including the crucial one.
  Negative
At  minutes, the film is a concise and well-executed example of smart documentary storytelling.
  Very positive
Its photography is particularly memorable for the way it captures the wild beauty and haunting atmosphere of the Santoalla region.
  Very positive
The one question the film left me with was how directors Mehrer and Becker found out about this case and what it was like for two Brooklyn-based filmmakers to go to Spain to make the film.
  Negative
There are probably a number of interesting tales in the answer to that.
  Positive
Or maybe that's another documentary altogether.
  Neutral
