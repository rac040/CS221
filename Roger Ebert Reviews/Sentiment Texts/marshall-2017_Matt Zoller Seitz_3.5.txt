The s legal thriller Marshall is a solid drama that gives viewers a glimpse into an alternate universe one where African-American actors could be treated as old school movie stars, in period pieces that are less concerned with giving audiences a solemn, Oscar-baiting history lesson than an entertaining story that happens to be drawn from life.
  Positive
Chadwick Boseman, Hollywoods go-to guy for playing important Black Americans, adds another icon to his gallery: NAACP attorney and future Supreme Court justice Thurgood Marshall, a New Yorker dispatched to Bridgeport, Connecticut, to defend a black man, Joseph Spell  Sterling K. Brown, who stands accused of the rape and attempted murder of a white society woman, Eleanor Strubing  Kate Hudson.
  Very negative
Filmmaker  Reginald Hudlin  House Party,  Boomerang adapts a script by the father-son screenwriting team of Michael and  Jacob Koskoff that jumps off from a real case.
  Negative
Many of the most seemingly outrageous twists are pulled from the record.
  Positive
One is a decision by the sitting judge  James Cromwell, an imperious old white man who doesnt appreciate having a cocky black New Yorker in his court, to turn Marshall into a mute bystander by declaring that only attorneys licensed to practice law in Connecticut can argue before his bench.
  Negative
This feels like an early checkmate intended to send Spell straight to prison: the NAACP only assigned Marshall to Bridgeport in the first place because the white majority had already made up its mind about Spells guilt and no local lawyers would take his case.
  Very negative
And so the  hero is forced to use his co-counsel, Sam Friedman  Josh Gad, an insurance lawyer whos never tried a criminal case before, as a sock puppet.
  Negative
He works out details of their strategy behind the scenes, then guides Friedman during jury selection and opening arguments via handwritten notes, facial reactions, and irritated sighs and grunts.
  Negative
From here, Marshall turns into a mismatched buddy film, of a kind that weve never seen before.
  Negative
Although Boseman is  credible as a brilliant attorney, especially when Marshall and Friedman are trying to work around the judges restrictions, his performance as Marshall is not an imitation' nor is it overly concerned with giving us a true psychological portrait of Thurgood Marshall the man.
  Positive
Its more of a classic Hollywood alpha male badass performance, in the vein of  Humphrey Bogart,  Paul Newman, and other thcentury white superstars who reveled in playingsarcastic, sexy,domineering jerks, but were so exciting to watch whether orating, listening, smoking a cigarette in a jazz club, or just wearing an impeccably tailored suit and walking from point A to point B that you enjoyed them no matter what their charactersdid.
  Negative
This Thurgood Marshall is so accomplished at such a young age having already argued his first U.S. Supreme Court case, and claimed  Langston Hughes  Jussie Smollett and Zora Neale Hurston Chilli as drinking buddies that when he arrives in Bridgeport he offhandedly orders Friedman to help him with his bags, then pokes fun at him and plays head-games with him every chance he gets.
  Negative
Apparently the latter is an actual Thurgood Marshall trait: he was suspended twice from Pennsylvanias Lincoln University for pranks and hazing.
  Negative
He's a bit of a bastard at times.
  Negative
But just when you start to worry that Marshall is about to settle into a repetitious groove, with a know-it-all hero solving a nebbishs problems, the full force of the towns majority starts to weigh on the duo, freighting their work with paranoia and fear of violence.
  Negative
What follows is a humbling experience for both men.
  Positive
Marshall is not a soup-to-nuts biography of one of the most significant figures in U.S. legal history, but a legal potboiler dependent on teamwork.
  Negative
Itpays attention to issues of racial, religious and gender discrimination without wavering from its main objective: giving us an entertaining film about a couple of guys who are in way over their heads.
  Positive
One of the movies most intriguing qualities is the way that it shows how power and respect vary depending on what room youre in, and whos in it with you.
  Very positive
Marshall moseys into Bridgeport as if hes wearing an invisible cape, but in court, in the city jail, at home with his wife Buster  Keesha Sharp, and in Harlem nightspots with cultural giants, he is diminished, by his own choice or against his will' we perceive him differently, and he perceives himself differently.
  Negative
When Marshall is face-to-face with brawny white men who hate him on sight, the movie sharply reminds us that there are situations where college degrees aren't worth the paper they're printed on.
  Negative
A less frightening but equally dispiriting scene finds Marshall speaking to a black lawyer in Bridgeport who passed the bar but was denied a license to practice law because of his race.
  Negative
Friedman, too, seems like a different person depending on what room hes in.
  Negative
Marshalls swagger and awesome legal track record intimidate him, but his own younger brother and law partner idolizes and defers to him, and its obvious that in Bridgeports Jewish community hes a man of influence, respected in large part because he has the nerve to accept challenges that others run from.
  Negative
Theres a marvelous moment in a synagogue mens room where a member of the congregation seems as if hes about to insult Friedman for representing an accused schwarze rapist, then slips some cash into Friedman's jacket pocket.
  Neutral
Both Boseman and Gad do a superb job of ratcheting their characters physical confidence up and down by degrees, depending on the circumstances.
  Positive
This gives the movie a richer sense of time and place than you might have expected.
  Positive
It also draws parallels between the experience of Jews and blacks in s America that come to fruition in the movie's final summation.
  Positive
Hudlin and his writers pander a bit at times.
  Positive
Too many important moments are spelled out in dialogue even though images and performances have already explained whats at stake' some of the twists are too predictable,and in the last third, especially, you may start to suspect that the film is playing fast and loose with the historical record to create a more superficially exciting story.
  Negative
Although I knew Thurgood Marshall could write a dissenting opinion for the ages, his street-fighting skill was news to me.
  Negative
But the movies missteps and over-reaches are all of a piece.
  Positive
The farther away from the courtroom we get, the more Marshall starts to feel like a detective thriller with subtle Western movie accents: the terse, one-word title positions its hero as a tough, smart sheriff trying to clean up a corrupt town.
  Negative
Theres an almost B-movie quality to certain parts a touch of Shaft and I mean that as praise.
  Negative
What I like most about Marshall the man and Marshall the film are their laid back confidence.
  Positive
It carries itself as if weve already seen a lot of projects like this one as if theres a new funny, exciting period piece about a brilliant, two-fisted black lawyer in theaters every week, and this is just the latest.
  Positive
I hope the filmmakers are already working on Marshall Returns.
  Neutral
