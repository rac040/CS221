Wild  begins with novice hiker  Cheryl Strayed at one of the lowest points  during her three-month, ,-mile-long solo trek along the Pacific  Crest Trail.
  Negative
She gingerly inspects her bloodied feet and prepares to  pluck a battered nail from her big toe.
  Negative
While yanking it, she emits a  primal scream of agony and causes one of her boots to tumble over a  steep cliff.
  Negative
In frustration, she tosses its partner down the incline as  well, and shrieks some colorful expletives for good measure.
  Positive
We  should rightfully be filled with concern for this traveler, all alone  in the wilderness and sans appropriate footwear.
  Negative
Yet I knew she would be  all right.
  Neutral
Why?
  Negative
Because  Reese Witherspoon, an actress with enough  high-octane spunk to fuel an entire cheerleading squad as well as the  football team, is playing her.
  Positive
Witherspoon  has always been adept at embodying extreme personalities who somehow  manage to overcome whatever barriers are placed in their way.
  Neutral
Whether it  is the underestimated smarts of Elle Woods in  Legally Blonde or the  unstoppable ambition of Tracy Flick in  Election, she is an expert at  personifying perky pillars of strength who are just a wee bit scary.
  Negative
She is also a survivor, and not just on screen.
  Positive
Her career took a fall  that rivaled Strayeds wayward boot after she won a Best Actress Oscar  for her role as country legend  June Carter Cash in s Walk the  Line.
  Neutral
How she ended up in the likes of Four Christmases which  actually managed to collect a domestic gross of  million and How  Do You Know an out-and-out gobbler courtesy of once-great James L.  Brooks is anyones guess.
  Negative
Mine would be that male-dominated mainstream  Hollywood rarely feels the need to showcase women over  as the  centerpiece of a movie, Academy Award or not.
  Negative
But  Witherspoon recently took matters into her own hands by procuring film  projects for herself.
  Positive
She went after the rights to  Gone Girl with  gusto.
  Neutral
Unfortunately, she ended up with only a producer credit instead  of also starring after director  David Fincher nixed the idea and went  with  Rosamund Pike instead.
  Negative
Me, I would have loved to have seen her  variation on the schemer known as Amazing Amy.
  Negative
But  there was no way she was letting go of the lead role in Wild, based  on Strayeds  best-selling memoir that recalls other self-induced  trials of endurance such as  Eat Pray Love,   Hours and Into the  Wild.
  Negative
And while Witherspoon summons all her skills and then some to  portray this lost soul on the path to recovery, I just could not  completely buy her in this part.
  Negative
She is fine, however, when comically lugging an unwieldy backpack and  steadfastly sticking to her walking tour that begins in the Mojave  Desert and ends at the Cascades.
  Positive
There are plenty of encounters, both  welcome and unwelcome, along the way, including a rattlesnake, a curious  fox, predatory men and surprisingly kind strangers.
  Positive
She sweats, swears,  shivers and mutters her way through scorching heat and unseasonable  snow, copes with dehydration and gobbles freeze-dried meals, all the  while building up quite a stench in between rest stops.
  Negative
OK,  I dont believe Witherspoon would ever reek so horribly.
  Negative
Southern gals  like her glow, dont you know.
  Negative
Yet she is still youthful enough at ,  looking as if she is ready for high-school gym class in her hiking  shorts and T-shirt, that she easily pulls off portraying a -year-old.
  Negative
In fact, she hasnt been so unguarded and emotionally open onscreen  since her captivating film debut as a young teen in love in s The  Man in the Moon.
  Positive
Just as director  Jean-Marc Vallee brought out the  best in  Matthew McConaughey and  Jared Leto in last years Dallas Buyers  Club, he mostly does right by Witherspoon.
  Positive
As  for life-threatening hazards, they mainly exist in her head as flickers  of old memories grow into full-blown flashback sequences.
  Negative
I was less  convinced by these visits to the past where we see Strayed lose her  bearings after her adored mother dies from a virulent bout of cancer at  .
  Negative
Laura Dern, only nine years older than Witherspoon, manages to be  quite fabulous as Bobbi, a human sunbeam who radiates unconditional love  for her children after leaving behind an abusive marriage.
  Negative
Overwhelmed  by grief, Strayed engages in reckless sex with strangers and picks up a  heroin addiction while destroying her marriage to a rather sweet and  caring husband.
  Positive
Witherspoon tries, even doing her first-ever nude  scenes, to convince us she has hit the skids.
  Positive
Yet no matter how greasy  her hair or how dead her eyes, I just cant buy her as a  self-destructive junkie.
  Negative
Thankfully,  Wild only suffers somewhat from this disconnect.
  Negative
It is engaging  enough to follow Strayed on her journey, one that she dedicates to  Bobbi.
  Positive
Her mission statement: Im going to walk myself back to the  woman my mother thought I was.
  Negative
I enjoyed her literary-inspired  scribbles left behind at various signposts, starting with this quotation  from Emily Dickinson: If your nerve deny you, go above your nerve.
  Positive
Some of the soundtrack tunes are obvious particularly Simon and  Garfunkels El Condor Pasa and Homeward Bound but they are  leavened with snippets of Lucinda Williams, Portishead and even some  highly appropriate Grateful Dead.
  Negative
Ultimately,  I decided to forgive most of the hints of miscasting after being  brought to tears by an unexpectedly beautiful moment provided by a young  boy strolling the trail with his grandmother as he serenades Strayed  with a heartbreaking rendition of Red River Valley.
  Negative
Even when Wild  occasionally stumbles, it gets back on track with relative ease.
  Negative
