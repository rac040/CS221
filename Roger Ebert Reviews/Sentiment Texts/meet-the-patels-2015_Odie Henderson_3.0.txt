When he goes off on tangents, Geeta brings him back to the topic at hand.
  Negative
And though very supportive, she never lets him off the hook.
  Negative
She even pulls an older siblings for your own good move that is the films strongest moment: The documentarian in her overrides her brothers reasonable request to shut the camera off.
  Positive
She shuts it off, but sneakily turns it back on, capturing a moment of high drama.
  Positive
This probably sounds like someones home movies Ravi jokes about this by pointing out the occasionally present boom mike and the shaky framing of some scenes but Meet the Patels is about more than Geetas family.
  Negative
It tells a culturally specific story about love and marriage.
  Positive
Additionally, it speaks to the generational struggles over tradition and societal expectations, highlighting that children often have different ideas about life than their parents.

These are universal subjects, so one does not have to be of Indian descent to appreciate Meet the Patels.
  Neutral
Youll either learn something new or nod your head with amused familiarity.

Geeta and Ravi are the unmarried children of Vasant and Champa Patel.
  Negative
Their single status is of concern to their father and a major point of ironic aggravation for their Mom.

Mrs. Patel, who steals this movie from her son, has an unmatched reputation as a matchmaker, yet like a psychic she cant use her powers for her own benefit.
  Positive
On a trip back to the area from which his parents emigrated, the question of marriage is on everyones mind.
  Positive
People already know of Ravis marital status, and every other person then tries to hook him up.
  Negative
Think of that annoying relative who is always up in your business, Ravi says.
  Negative
Now imagine an entire village full of that person.
  Positive
With so much pressure to get married after a certain age, a single status becomes a code red, Ravi warns, one can understand why Mrs. Patel has agita over her lack of grandchildren.
  Negative
When Meet the Patels opens, Ravi has just broken up with Audrey, a White woman he has been keeping from his parents for the past two years.
  Negative
It seems like shes the one, but Ravi knows this relationship iscontroversial.

This yearlong, cross-country search takes up most of the film.

There was a guy there, so no hanky-panky!
  Negative
Mr. Patel says of his date.
  Neutral
Things are different now.
  Neutral
You can go on multiple dates before deciding.
  Neutral
Ravi goes on date after date, none successful.
  Negative
When Geeta nonchalantly mentions that shes gone on  dates without success, Ravi tells her she should be in front of the camera instead of him.
  Negative
Perhaps for the sequel.
  Neutral
Multiple dates may be ok, but some rules havent changed.
  Negative
As if finding a mate werent difficult enough, for Ravi and Geeta, It is strongly preferred that they find another Patel.
  Negative
If they chose one from India, there is also a geographical restriction regarding where one can find another Patel.
  Negative
I found this section fascinating, especially the sense of fraternity that accompanied ones last name.
  Positive
If youre a Patel, any other Patel will welcome you as if you were family, even if your interaction is temporary.
  Positive
Theres a hilarious animated vignette at an American motel where Mr. Patels drivers license becomes a golden ticket for services the motel would never offer regular patrons.
  Negative
If only this fraternityexclusive club thing worked for me with otherHendersons!
  Negative
But I digress.
  Positive
In todays Indian culture, the matchmaking game has been upped exponentially.
  Negative
Now there are websites and conferences devoted to getting one betrothed.
  Negative
The technology follows the standard rules for matchmaking.
  Neutral
The most fascinating piece of non-technical marketing assistance is the biodata, a sort of personal resume that, like an employment resume, is usually full of bent truths.
  Negative
Ive never even seen my biodata!
  Negative
one talking head reveals.
  Positive
It creates a rosy picture of you thats not you, says another.
  Negative
On the biodata is a specific detail that took Meet the Patels to another place for me.
  Neutral
Reading his own biodata, Ravi mentions skin tone, wheatish brown.
  Negative
He then lists other descriptions of brown skin, all of which are explicit about skewering toward the lighter shades.
  Negative
The lighter you are, the more attractive you are, one of the interviewees tells us.
  Positive
Good luck finding a mate for your dark daughter with the pH.D!
  Negative
Ravi jokes.
  Neutral
We learn that some people buy skin-lightening cream or keep their kids out of the Sun so they can stay wheatish brown.
  Negative
Now, as a brown person myself, I could not let the notion escape my head that, like my people, Indians have a paper bag test.
  Negative
It was a darkly funny revelation that, regardless of race, if you were brown you had to deal with both society at large and your own crew in this regard.
  Positive
Meet the Patels sneaks up on you with these mentions and subtle explorations of intraracial and interracial bias, and it does so without destroying the films light tone.
  Negative
Like the rom-coms it emulates, the ending of Meet the Patels is never in doubt.
  Negative
But this film is about the journey, not the destination.
  Neutral
I liked how, during the film, your allegiances change back and forth.
  Positive
Sometimes I agreed with the parents, sometimes with Ravi, and at times I grew irritated with both of them.
  Positive
If theres a flaw, its in how the film presents the women Ravi encounters.
  Negative
Theres a detachment that doesnt often work.
  Negative
Many times, Ravi comes off as shallow in regard to these women hes meeting, and the dates all tend to blur together.
  Negative
I also wish Id known more about his relationship with Audrey' the lack of this information makes the ending feel rushed.
  Negative
Those issues aside, Meet the Patels is still a charming, informative and funny documentary.
  Positive
