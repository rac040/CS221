Three years ago,  Cameron Diaz and  Jason Segel co-starred for director  Jake Kasdan in " Bad Teacher" and had an enjoyable, raunchy chemistry.
  Negative
She was the bad teacher of the films title: a drunken vixen who was only working with children because she needed money for a boob job.
  Negative
He was the irreverent, easygoing gym teacher who saw through her flaws and schemes and wanted to hang out with her anyway.
  Negative
It was a one-joke movie, but there were enough shadings and variations within that one joke to make it somewhat fun.
  Negative
Now, Diaz and Segel co-star for Kasdan again in Sex Tape, but their characters are so indiscernible as actual human beings, its hard to tell who they are, much less whether they have any sort of enjoyable, raunchy chemistry.
  Negative
Shes a married, stay-at-home mother of two who writes a blog about her family, and thats about it.
  Negative
Hes her husband, who works at a radio station in some capacity, maybe...?
  Positive
They make a sex tape to spice up their formerly frisky marriage and it accidentally goes public.
  Positive
Its a one-joke movie that feels like a one-joke movie.
  Neutral
Its a high-concept premise that ends up being preposterous and riddled with plot holes, and the way these fools fling themselves into an all-night, madcap adventure to right their wrong is painfully strained and unfunny.
  Very negative
Also, the whole notion of making a sex tape and then being ashamed of it seems sort of quaint at this point as if everyone involved missed the zeitgeist for maximum relevance and edginess about five years ago.
  Negative
High-tech devices to create quality, do-it-yourself cinema surround us more than ever, as we well know.
  Positive
Nowhere is this more true than in Sex Tape, which is essentially one long commercial for Apple products wrapped in a toothless, feel-good comedy about a longtime married couple reconnecting.
  Negative
Its amazing, the quality of the camera on the iPad thats propped securely on top of the laundry basket as Diazs Annie and Segels Jay re-enact every single pose in the iconic s tome "The Joy of Sex.
  Neutral
"And wow the Cloud!
  Positive
Its so powerful as it sucks in every last blip of digital information in ways no one could possibly understand including the people who made this movie.
  Neutral
Things were simpler back when Annie and Jay were young.
  Neutral
We first meet the couple in college, cavorting like bunny rabbits anywhere and everywhere.
  Negative
This is their primary personality trait: They like having sex with each other.
  Positive
Or at least, they did.
  Neutral
Cut to  years later which would make Diaz  when shes actually almost , which I know because we have the same exact birthday, but whatever, its a minor distraction.
  Negative
They still love and desire each other, but between work, kids, school, house, etc., they just dont have the same time or energy to maul each other the way they once did.
  Negative
It happens.
  Neutral
When Annie sends the kids to Grandmas house for the night, she and Jay try to use the opportunity to get their freak on, but they initially fumble.
  Negative
A few tequila shots later, though, and theyre starring in their own homemade porn video.
  Negative
Diaz and Segel get super naked and seem game for every goofy move that comes their way, but theres something stiff if youll pardon the pun about the way Kasdan stages these scenes and about Segels performance in general.
  Negative
Hes noticeably slimmed down and toned up since he famously went full-frontal in s " Forgetting Sarah Marshall."
  Negative
But he also seems to have lost the loose, amiable puppy-dog quality that made him so appealing.
  Negative
Hes so oddly inert here, its as if hes been encased in wax.
  Negative
Jay promises hell erase the video, but not only does he forget to do that, he also inadvertently sends it to a bunch of people through a new syncing app.
  Negative
In one of the many contrived plot devices that keep this effort rumbling along, Jay has a habit of giving old iPads to friends and relatives as gifts.
  Negative
So now all these people have access to their antics, which lasted three hours.
  Negative
"Sex Tape" itself feels that long, even though its only about  minutes.
  Negative
The script from Segel, his longtime friend and collaborator  Nicholas Stoller and  Kate Angelo "The Back-Up Plan" finds Annie and Jay scurrying all over Los Angeles to scoop up these tablets before anyone sees the movie.
  Negative
Well, anyone else, that is at least one person has seen it and is sending Jay anonymous, cryptic texts in a subplot that feels forced.
  Negative
Jay keeps making bad decisions, Annie keeps getting annoyed with him.
  Negative
Rob Corddry and  Ellie Kemper, who play the couples best friends, go along for the ride but mostly go to waste.
  Negative
The whole process is extremely tedious, but one of their stops which amounts to an extended detour is so random and unexpected that it breathes much-needed life into the film.
  Positive
Annie and Jay visit the lavish mansion of Hank Rosenbaum  Rob Lowe, the cardigan-wearing CEO of the family-friendly company thats on the verge of paying big money for Annies blog.
  Negative
Another detail that seems distractingly impossible.
  Neutral
Inexplicably, Annie has given Hank her iPad, so she has to knock on his door and distract him while Jay searches for the device.
  Negative
The casting of Lowe, who notoriously suffered his own sex-tape scandal in the late s, at first seems like an in-joke thats too easy.
  Negative
But the more his character reveals himself and a complexity thats sadly lacking in everyone else the more you realize how cleverly it taps into Lowes longtime chops as a standout supporting player.
  Negative
I wont give away what happens between Diaz and Lowe, but I will say that this is the actor with whom she has real chemistry and this is the shocking video youll really want to see.
  Negative
