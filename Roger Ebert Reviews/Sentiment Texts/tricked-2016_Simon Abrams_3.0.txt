"Tricked," an enjoyably soapy thriller, is for anyone who has wondered: Whatever happened to  Paul Verhoeven?
  Positive
Verhoeven, the director of such consummately nasty social critiquegenre films as "RoboCop," "Total Recall," " Showgirls," hasn't stopped working.
  Negative
In fact, he's got a new thriller starring  Isabelle Huppert debuting in France this fall.
  Positive
He also made "Black Book,"a perfectly grimy Dutch WW drama, back in .
  Positive
"Tricked," a -minute short film puffed up to feature-length by the addition of a half-hour behind-the-scenes featurette, is presented as a career rehabilitation of sorts: a commercial for Verhoeven's adaptability.
  Negative
During the film's otherwise superfluous making-of supplement, Verhoeven talks about how he and screenwriter Kim Van Kooten wrote a four-page scenario that introduces eight characters.
  Negative
Verhoeven and Van Kooten then crowd-funded plot suggestions,filmed numerous submissions, and cobbled together a narrative thatsuited Verhoeven's eccentric tastes.
  Very negative
The result is a light but satisfying appetizer, one that will, for better and worse, leave viewers hungry for more.
  Negative
"Tricked" begins as a blatant advertisement for Paul Verhoeven, versatile filmmaker.
  Negative
This part of the film is only interesting in that it doesn't reveal anything substantial about his personality or abilities.
  Negative
We see him smiling his way through suggestions and talking about how important it is to him to challenge himself creatively "I personally trust that the unknown forces you to be creative".
  Positive
Verhoeven's films actively mock authority, so you'd be forgiven for rolling your eyes as the director of " Starship Troopers" compares his collaborative process to a "democracy," then jokingly suggest to one actress that she lower her shirt "We don't have to insist on that!"
  Negative

  Neutral
Feel free to step out to the lobby for this part of the film.
  Neutral
The fiction portion of "Tricked" the part you really paid to see fares much better.
  Negative
Company man Remco's family life is thrown into chaos when ex-loversecretary Nadja  Sallie Harmsen reveals at his birthday party that she's eight months pregnant.
  Negative
Her news isnot that shocking: Remco  Peter Blok is a renowned philanderer, an inarguable fact that his disaffected teenage children Lieke Carolien Spoor and Tobias  Robert de Hoog are aware of.
  Negative
Even Remco's cool-headed wife Ineke Ricky Koole seems to know more than she lets on, though at first we're unclear on how many details she knows.
  Negative
Nevertheless, Nadja's presence is inconvenient for Remco: his business partners are blackmailing him into selling his company's controlling stake, and teenage conquestLieke's BFF Merel  Gaite Jansen wants more than a little attention.
  Negative
Determining who knows what, and just how badly they're screwing each other over, accounts for approximately  the film's inessential pleasures.
  Negative
Betrayals are casually revealed through cell phones abandoned on diner counters, laptops left without passwords, even a tampon left bobbing in Remco's toilet.
  Negative
This last plot point is a sign of the film's conspicuous but lighthearted viciousness as well as a wily critique of information age carelessness.
  Negative
Verhoeven's characters are perpetually distracted as they openly pursue their vices: drinks, drugs, sex, etc.
  Negative
Everybody has skeletons hidden in easily accessible closets.
  Neutral
"Tricked" is funny though not in a "funny ha ha" kind of way because everybody knows what everybody else is doing.
  Positive
By constantly poking fun of pretty young things with cell phones and computers who told grandpa that revenge porn is a thing?
  Positive
, the movie risks making Verhoeven seem like an old man shouting at digital clouds.
  Negative
But technology isn't the root of all evil in "Tricked."
  Negative
It's a means to characters' short-sighted ends.
  Neutral
In Verhoeven's world, people tryst, take pictures of each other, and incriminate themselves without the help of Steve Jobs-approved products.
  Positive
The message is something like: IPhones don't screw people people screw people.
  Positive
Over and over.
  Neutral
With a goofy smile.
