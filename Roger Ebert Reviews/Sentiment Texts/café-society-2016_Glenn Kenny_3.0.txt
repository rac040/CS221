In both his work and his interviews,  Woody Allen shows a quietly insistent cynicism he would say realism about the futility of human endeavor in a meaningless, godless universe, and stuff.
  Negative
There is one aspect of earthly existence for which he has a demonstrable soft spot, however, and that is The Past.
  Negative
Which is possibly the reason that his most recent films set there Midnight in Paris and this weeks Caf Society are among the most beguiling in his ongoing late work.
  Neutral
The opening image of Caf Society sets the tone: a breathtaking shot of an impossibly clear-blue swimming pool at dusk, surrounded by elegant people in formal wear.
  Positive
Allen, production designer  Santo Loquasto, and cinematographer  Vittorio Storaro the legendary camera maestro here working, as is Allen, for the first time in the digital format, and knocking it out of the park have a very particular vision of s Hollywood, despite Allens well-known and well-worn antipathy toward Los Angeles in general.
  Positive
It is here, Allen tells us in his voiceover narration, that talent agent Phil Stern  Steve Carell, seen at poolside holding court before being interrupted by a phone call, is a major player and contented fat cat.
  Negative
The phone call is from his older sister Rose  Jeannie Berlin, matriarch of a clan right out of Allens   Radio Days, informing him that her youngest son Bobby  Jesse Eisenberg is headed out to the West Coast, and that Phil should help set him up, despite the fact that the energetic young man hasnt the faintest idea of what he wants to do.
  Positive
Speaking of Radio Days, Allen limns Bobbys family with the same anecdotal detail that he used to such great effect in the older film.
  Negative
Bobbys sister Evelyn  Sari Lennick is married to a philosophical academic, while his older brother Ben  Corey Stoll is an aggressive gangster.
  Negative
How all this will come to bear on Bobbys adventures a whole continent away we have no idea, but Allens discursive mode is not unpleasant, and it does in fact pay off, albeit in an oblique way.
  Very negative
As for Bobby himself, Eisenberg initially plays him as a young Allen stand-in, albeit a little more New York street-smart and self determined.
  Negative
Uncle Phil is so busy, andor uninterested, in giving his nephew the time of day that he doesnt see him for a week, during which time Bobby decides, with long-distance encouragement from Ben, to sample the local call-girl culture, leading to a  Deconstructing Harry-reminiscent scene thats one of the movies few sour notes,  Anna Camps game efforts as an inexperienced prostitute notwithstanding.
  Very negative
Once Phil does see the fellow, he makes him an errand boy, and outsources overseeing his social life to agency secretary Veronica, or Vonnie, played by a luminous  Kristen Stewart.
  Negative
Together they sample Hollywood Mexican food, the edenic sands of Malibu, and ornate movie houses showing pristine prints of  Barbara Stanwyck movies.
  Negative
What a paradise it seems, except that Bobby falls hopelessly in love with Vonnie and Vonnies got a mysterious boyfriend.
  Negative
One whos almost never around because, for one thing, hes a married man, and for another Well, I dont want to give anything away, but if you dont see whats coming, you havent seen many Woody Allen films.
  Negative
While predictable in certain respects, Caf Society surprises in others, one of which is the life goes on swerve it makes midway through, one by which, among other things, its title is justified.
  Negative
Bobby and Vonnies separate lives see Bobby taking over management of a swank New York nightclub owned by his gangster brother and Vonnie becoming a Hollywood wife.
  Negative
That they never really got over each other is the theme of the movies languid, lyrical and sad final third.
  Negative
When I saw  Irrational Man, Allens film prior to this, in , it occurred to me that Allen has achieved something I never would have predicted, and he himself might have never dared hope: he is, at this point in his career, a better director than he is writer.
  Negative
The plot twists and dialogue of Irrational Man were familiar to the point of near-hoariness, but Allens work with his actors, his shot selection and his pacing were supple and fleet, and made the movie more effective than it would seem to have had the right to be.
  Negative
Caf Society has sharper writing than Irrational Man although the longtime Allen follower will hear more than one recycled gag, including one from, of all pictures, the  Casino Royale, and when it doesnt, his cast is motivated enough to bring it off' as tired as the movies already oft-quoted line about life being written by a sadistic comedy writer is, Eisenberg makes it work in context.
  Very negative
Eisenbergs performance here, by the way, is one of his best in a while.
  Very positive
After the one-two punch of End of the Tour and  Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, I almost expected to never enjoy his work again, but he does some pretty special things here' his reaction to seeing Vonnie again, unexpectedly, after a long time apart, is one of them.
  Negative
But its the filmmaking around the writing that casts a particular spell.
  Neutral
Particularly near the end, as Allen adds up the moral failings and squelched desires and doused dreams of all his characters.
  Negative
The director provides voiceover narration throughout, and while his timing and inflection are on point as ever, his voice is frail, weakening' for the first time in a film, he sounds like the person he is, an -year-old man.
  Negative
And then he wraps the whole thing up at a New Years celebration thats as visually beautiful as the pool party at the films opening but is at the same time infused with a powerful but still wistful cinematic incense of paradise lost.
  Positive
