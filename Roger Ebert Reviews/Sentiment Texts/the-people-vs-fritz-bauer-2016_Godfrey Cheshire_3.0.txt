The title character of The People vs. Fritz Bauer was a fascinating man whose career as a prosecutor, trying to expose the crimes of the Nazis, certainly deserves the dramatic treatment director  Lars Kraume gives it here.
  Positive
A Jew born in Germany, Fritz Bauer had begun a legal career that was interrupted when he was sent to a concentration camp in the s.
  Negative
After managing to extricate himself, he spent the war years in Denmark and Sweden, then returned to Germany and the law in the late s. Bauer reached the peak of his renown in the early s when he prosecuted commanders of Auschwitz in a public trial.
  Negative
Though it may seem shocking now, relatively little public examination of the Holocaust had occurred in Germany since the end of the war.
  Negative
Many former Nazis occupied high positions in German society and officialdom.
  Negative
Though Bauer was accused of pursuing vengeance as a Jew, he insisted his efforts were motivated not by the past but by the future: he wanted to educate German young people so that the horrors their ancestors committed were never repeated.
  Negative
The People vs. Fritz Bauer concerns not this trial but a more hidden episode in Bauers career that occurred five years earlier.
  Negative
The tale opens in Frankfurt in , when Bauer  Burghart Klauner in a vivid, forceful performance is discovered passed out in his bath from an overdose of alcohol and sleeping pills.
  Negative
His enemies in the establishment, who resent and fear his dogged pursuit of former Nazis, seize on this as a possible reason to force him into retirement.
  Negative
Rumors have it he intended suicide.
  Neutral
I have a pistol, he replies.
  Neutral
If I want to kill myself, there wont be any rumors.
  Negative
The prosecutors survival means he can pursue a uniquely compelling case: the capture of Adolf Eichmann, a key implementer of the Holocaust.
  Positive
The chase begins when Bauer receives a letter from a German in Argentina who says he know where Eichmann is because his daughter has begun dating the Nazis son.
  Neutral
The information is persuasive, but its also a problem: if Bauer takes it to Interpol or the German intelligence service, its very likely Eichmann will be alerted and flee.
  Negative
Instead, he goes to Israel and presents his evidence to the Mossad, Israels intelligence service.
  Positive
They appreciate his efforts but say they are preoccupied with Israels Arab enemies, and besides, theyve had reports of Eichmanns whereabouts from all over the world' to pursue this lead, they would have to have confirmation from a second source.
  Negative
Bauer has his work cut out for him when he returns to Germany, and its surrounded by dangers.
  Negative
If hes discovered colluding with the Israelis, he can be charged with treason.
  Positive
And theres a more personal peril: In Denmark, police reports exist showing that he visited male prostitutes when he lived there.
  Negative
In Germany, the notorious Paragraph , by which the Nazis criminalized most homosexual behavior, is still in the books.
  Negative
These two areas of concern converge when Bauer confides his hunt for Eichmann to a sympathetic young prosecutor, Karl Angermann Ronald Zehrfeld, a charismatic actor who will be known to U.S. audiences from Christian Petzolds  Barbara and  Phoenix, who in turn shares some of his own secrets with Bauer.
  Negative
Angermann is an invented character, and the story elements that involve him are the only major areas where the film diverges from history.
  Neutral
Unfortunately it shows: While theres dramatic power in the relationship between the two prosecutors thanks in part to the strong work of the two actors playing them, some of the revelations about the younger man feel contrived and overly melodramatic.
  Negative
Kraumes mounting of this tale, while capable enough, is also rather staid and conventional.
  Negative
A sharper, more forceful rendition of somewhat similar Cold War material can be found in  Steven Spielbergs Bridge of Spies, in which Klausnerr also appeared.
  Positive
But theres no question that this story was worth telling.
  Positive
Throughout, Bauer intends to bring Eichmann to trial in Germany, as a way of exposing the whole Nazi hierarchy.
  Negative
But the government of Konrad Adenauer doesnt want some of its members pasts revealed, while the U.S. is disinclined to upset an important ally.
  Positive
Eichmann, of course, was tried and executed by Israel.
  Negative
Bauers role in his capture was not revealed until many years later.
  Negative
