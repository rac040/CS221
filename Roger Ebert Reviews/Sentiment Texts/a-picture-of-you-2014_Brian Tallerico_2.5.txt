Griefalmost alwaysproduces abrupt mood changes.
  Negative
Weve all seen the Hollywood clich of the laughter that turns to tears but theres something in that trope the idea that our own emotions have the potential to flip like a coin when were dealing with loss.
  Neutral
J.P. Chans light-but-sweet A Picture of You endeavors to recreate that unpredictability in the days following the death of a loved one by taking a sharp right turn from melodrama to comedy at the end of the first act.
  Negative
What starts as a traditional character piece about siblings dealing with demons after the death of their mother eventually becomes a screwball comedy as Chan finds a unique way to cycle through cinematic grief.
  Positive
At one point, Jen  Jo Mei says about the photograph that pulls the switch, I didnt describe the genre.
  Negative
Its a nod to a film that doesnt really have one either.
  Positive
Sullen Jen and stubborn Kyle  Andrew Pang are forced to go through that awful series of days that most of us will eventually reach on our calendars packing up the home of a deceased parent.
  Negative
Animosity bubbles not far under the surface as Kyle chose to come home and take care of their mother played by  Jodi Long in a series of brief flashbacks while Jen couldnt bring herself to do so.
  Negative
Its a classic cinematic resentment: the sibling who felt he did more for their mother before she passed and the one who regrets not doing enough.
  Positive
Naturally, days of packing up books and other personal belongings only serve as a backdrop for Jen amp' Kyle to deal with the issues they have with each other.
  Negative
And then Kyle goes to copy moms files from her computer to a flash drive and clicks on a picture that changes everything.
  Negative
A series of brief, blurry photos show another side of mom, and the naked side of one of her lovers.
  Negative
Naturally, theres a bit of mental block when it comes to Kyle amp' Jen imagining that their mother had sex but its not handled in an overtly sitcomish manner.
  Negative
Kyle seems truly shellshocked and Jen honestly confused, but its more regarding the idea that someone they loved had secrets that included pornographic pictures than the whole eww, my parents have sex!
  Negative
plot device pulled out by lesser comedies.
  Neutral
Chan allows the revelation to not only turn the film to comedy from melodrama but push his two characters to acceptance that people are more complicated than we think, even our parents.
  Neutral
The tonal shift really happens when Jens boyfriend Doug  Lucas Dixon and pal Mika  Teyonah Parris show up to help in the packing cause, mere moments after the siblings see pics of moms sex life.
  Negative
The siblings try to keep the secret of why theyre rattled but their behavior starts to shift.
  Negative

  Negative
If mom could have casual sex, why not?
  Negative
Jen itches to tell Doug whats going on, and, most of all, to find out the owner of the male member mom chose to keep on her hard drive.
  Negative
Obviously, the situations of A Picture of You feel a bit forced but theyre handled in such a likable way that its forgivable, especially in the superior second half of the film.
  Positive
The final act, which approaches screwball comedy, is actually the strongest, as the characters have completely descended from the mountain of melodrama in the first act and the wispy memories of a mother they never knew have been replaced by covert investigations in the dark.
  Positive
I was worried the whole time that the cycle would eventually get back to melodrama and, of course, it does, but we like these four characters enough by that point that its easily forgivable.
  Negative
Theres absolutely no new ground broken here thematically and the clunky production values Chan shoots too much in close-up other than scenes of bike-riding on the rural streets around moms house sometimes feel like the product of a film school project.
  Very negative
And yet Chan and his cast, especially the truly great Mei, find the truth in the ridiculous enough for it to work on its own modest terms.
  Positive
