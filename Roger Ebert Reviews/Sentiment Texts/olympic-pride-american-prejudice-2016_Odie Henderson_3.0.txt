marks the  th anniversary of the  Berlin Games.
  Neutral
Adolf Hitler saw Germany-set games as a means of promoting the supposed superiority of his countrys White athletes.
  Negative
Hitlers intentions were usurped by an African-American runner named Jesse Owens, whose undeniable prowess on the track earned him fourOlympicgold medals.
  Negative
Of the Americans who participated in , Owens story stood out not just for his victories, but for the ironies that accompanied it: Here was a man representing a country that thought him inferior to Whites competing in another country that held the same thought, yet treated him better because he was an Olympian.
  Negative
When the story of the Olympicsis told, Owens stands out because, as the saying goes, the spoils are bestowed upon the victor.
  Negative
Yet, the standard Owens narrative I was fed during numerous Black History Month Februarys in my scholastic career never mentioned that Owens was not the only person of color to participate in Berlin.
  Negative
In fact,  other African-Americans  men and  women accompanied Owens, some in his field of expertise, others in areas such as boxing and weightlifting.
  Negative
Deborah Riley Drapers documentary, "OlympicPride, American Prejudice," tells the story of these unsung competitors, many of whom won medals of their own.
  Very positive
It opens just in time for s ownOlympicgames, and is well worth the time and money.
  Positive
OlympicPride, American Prejudice is the second  release to cover the Berlin games.
  Neutral
Back in February,  Stephen Hopkins bland, tone deaf Jesse Owens biopic,  Race opened to lukewarm reviews and respectable box office.
  Negative
The difference between the two films is blatantly exposed by their titles and their respective genres: Race is a cutesy play on words denoting both Jesse Owens athletic prowess and his color.
  Negative
As a result, the audience is free to choose which meaning makes them more comfortable.
  Positive
By comparison, Drapers title is fearlessly blunt.
  Positive
Theres only one way to interpret it, and as a documentary, OlympicPride, American Prejudice is freed from the crowd-pleasing constraints imposed on the biopic genre.
  Negative
Despite being well-acted and somewhat entertaining, two problems plagued Hopkins biopic.
  Negative
Race suffered from Hollywoods inability to tell a Black story without involving a White character as audience stand-in, making propaganda documentarian  Leni Riefenstahl into an almost bigger hero than Owens.
  Negative
The film also undercut the harsh realities of Owens story, muting the more sinister aspects of Avery Brundages role in the proceedings while also providing moments of manufactured hope that rang hollow and false.
  Negative
For example, both Draper and Hopkins inform the viewer that President Franklin Delano Roosevelt neither met with Owens, nor did he publicly congratulate him.
  Negative
But only Drapers film tells you the offensive reason why.
  Negative
Additionally, both films mention that Owens was forced to enter the event honoring him using the back entrance of the Waldorf-Astoria, but Race tacks on an unconvincing moment of post-racial harmony to soften the blow.
  Negative
OlympicPride, American Prejudice tackles its subject in a straightforward manner freed from dramatic license and the fear of box office failure.
  Negative
Though narrated by actor  Blair Underwood who also produced, the most prominent voices heard are those of the athletes who participated in the games.
  Negative
Many of them lived into the last few decades of the  th century, and some had other achievements that were just as fascinating as theirOlympiccompetitions.
  Positive
Though Draper expertly provides archival footage and pictures of her subjects, I wanted to close my eyes whenever one of the Olympians spoke, so that their words could wash over me in complete darkness.
  Negative
Black history is so often an oral tradition, passed down from generation to generation through the voices of those who lived the events or knew of them.
  Neutral
OlympicPride, American Prejudice honors that with judicious audio choices gleaned from the pure luck of having these narratives available, though it must not have been easy obtaining them.
  Negative
Testimonies of the athletes children also provide much-needed information.
  Positive
Sprinkled throughout these talking head moments are undercurrents of anger and sadness about how history has all but forgotten everyone but Owens, either due to the racism of the time or the careless notion that the success story of one person of color was more than enough for the s era public to handle.
  Negative
For example, theOlympicfate of Louise Stokes, who with Tidye Pickett became the first Black women selected for the U.S. team, is particularly infuriating and upsetting, but those emotions are coupled with the uplift from her resulting perseverance.
  Negative
Out of respect and admiration, I am compelled to list each of the  athletes names to close out this review.
  Negative
OlympicPride, American Prejudice tells not just how they did in theOlympicsbut also how they fared in life after the games were done.
  Negative
Their stories are well worth hearing.
  Positive
This list may feel as long as the closing credits reel of a Marvel movie, but thats appropriate' these peopleweresuperheroes: Jesse Owens and his lifelong friend, Dave Albritton' Tidye Pickett, John Brooks, boxers James Clark, Willis Johnson, Jack Wilson, Art Oliver and Howell King' Cornelius Johnson, Dr. James LuValle, U.S. Representative Ralph Metcalfe, Fritz Pollard, Jr., Jackie Robinsons older brother, Mack Robinson' Louise Stokes, weightlifter  John Terry, Archie Williams and John Woodruff.
