There's a sharp commentary at the heart of writer-director Jan Ole Gerster's debut feature, "A Coffee in Berlin" originally titled "Oh Boy", which swept up many of the major German film awards last year.
  Positive
It tells the story of Niko  Tom Schilling, a twentysomething guy who has dropped out of law school, failed to inform his father of that fact, and yet still accepts the father's funding for the schooling that no longer exists.
  Negative
"A Coffee in Berlin" has some funny things to say about the "younger generation" and its prolonged adolescence, its putting-off of dealing with serious matters.
  Positive
With themes reminiscent of " Frances Ha," down to its being filmed in black-and-white, "A Coffee in Berlin" presents a day or so in the life of Niko, as he careens from one absurd interaction to another, clearly floundering, but still not seeing that it is up to him to create the life he wants.
  Negative
Not tomorrow, but right now.
  Neutral
What is truly delightful about the film is its loopy, gently slapstick sense of humor, its use of continuous running gags that pay off cumulatively no small feat, and the dreamy sense that Schilling's somnambulism is pierced through only by the insane incomprehensible behavior of others.
  Positive
Schilling is a beautiful actor, accessible and vulnerable, and a veritable "Everyman" when compared to the kooks he encounters.
  Very positive
Just one example of many: Niko has moved into a new apartment, and his nosy upstairs neighbor Justus von Dohnnyi shows up at the door with a bowl of his wife's meatballs.
  Positive
The scene seems at first that it will be a friendly meet-and-greet until the neighbor, a big bulky guy, suddenly begins to open up about his lonely life, and how he just wants to watch football in peace, and how his wife recently had a mastectomy he sobs, "They took her whole rack!"
  Negative
, and it ends with the man crumpling down the wall, weeping, all as Niko looks on.
  Negative
They have known one another  minutes when this operatic moment occurs.
  Neutral
The scene is horrible.
  Negative
The scene is hilarious.
  Very positive
It takes a very deft hand to handle such material: to make it both awkward and comedic, inappropriate and true.
  Negative
The film gains momentum as it goes along.
  Negative
There's a beautiful tension in every interaction.
  Positive
With each person Niko meets, you wait for the other shoe to drop.He runs into an old classmate named Julika  Friederike Kempter, who seems happy to see him and yet also reminds him that he called her "Roly Poly Julia" back in school' she was sent to a "boarding school for fat people" to recover.
  Negative
She invites him to attend a performance-art piece put on by her theatre group, which leads to one of the funniest sequences in a film full of funny sequences.
  Positive
Anyone who has ever sat through an overly-earnest performance art piece and yearned to laugh, or at least inject some irony into the proceedings, will relate.
  Positive
There's even a movie-within-a-movie, as Niko and his friend Matze  Marc Hosemann visit the set of a film being shot in Berlin so that Matze an aspiring actor can try to weasel his way into a part.
  Negative
One of Matze's friends plays the lead in the movie-within-a-movie, and it's the story of a romance between an SS officer and a Jewish woman.
  Positive
The friend, in his SS uniform, tells Niko and Matze the plot and gets so worked up by his fictional character's dilemma that he wells up with tears, all as his listeners squirm with embarrassment.
  Negative
Extras mill around outside, some wearing yellow stars and some wearing Swastikas, smoking cigarettes and talking shop.
  Negative
The score of "A Coffee in Berlin" original music composed by Cherilyn MacNeil and The Major Minors is soft and jazzy, light and flippant, creating a comedic mood even when the actual events seem bleak.
  Positive
Niko confesses early on that he often doesn't understand what other people are saying to him, that they speak the same language but somehow he's not getting the message.
  Negative
His openness to others, and then his gentle confusion as things go south and they always do, is part of his isolation, and also why the film is so strangely and consistently funny.
  Very positive
Cinematographer  Philipp Kirsamer manages to fill the film with a bustling sense of the urban sprawl of Berlin, with Niko making his way through all of the busses and trains and subway stations, as well as a collage-impression of a city in flux, with vacant lots, graffiti, empty squares at dawn.
  Very negative
It's all part of the larger world with which Niko cannot seem to connect.
  Neutral
Niko is thwarted throughout the film in his quest to get a cup of coffee.
  Positive
The coffee machine is broken, or the vending machine is out of order, or the urn is empty, or a simple cup of coffee costs over three Euros.
  Negative
As "A Coffee in Berlin" goes on, the lack of coffee becomes emblematic of the feeling that the world is somehow massed against him.
  Negative
His relationship with his dad is horrible, his finances have been cut off, Roly Poly Julia has some potential but maybe she is as nutty as everyone else, and Niko can't seem to get a foothold on meaning, relevance, or action.
  Very negative
The continued running gag of no coffee gets an enormous emotional payoff in the film's contemplative final moment.
  Neutral
"A Coffee in Berlin" veers confidently from melancholy to absurdity and back, and then back again.
  Negative
It's amazing that it hangs together as well as it does.
  Very positive
The film is both silly and profound, a rare combination.
  Positive
