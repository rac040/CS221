A good prequel or sequel to the proto-slasher "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" is not unimaginable.
  Negative
True, series co-creator  Tobe Hooper didn't quite nail it with his "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre ," nor did the makers of surprisingly not-terrible "Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III."
  Negative
These near-miss effortsmake it tempting to recommend abandoning poor Leatherface, the hulking, mute, flesh-mask-wearing chainsaw buff.
  Negative
After all, Hooper and co-writer Kim Henkel's original film will always cast an appropriately large shadow over post- horror.
  Negative
But the approach that the makers of "Leatherface," a new prequel to the franchise, adopt is not only a bad one, it's poorly applied.
  Very negative
"Leatherface" tries to show us what made the man we know the legend he is now.
  Neutral
Sadly, the makers of "Leatherface" didn't put enough thought into a sleepy story that could easily be titled "I Was a Teenage Leatherface."
  Negative
If you've seen any of the previous incarnations of "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" or any post- horror film set in the countryside, then you know the world of "Leatherface."
  Negative
There's a dysfunctional family led by ruthless matriarch Verna Sawyer  Lili Taylor, and they bond by killing strangers.
  Negative
The film begins at the birthday party of poor pre-teen Jed  Boris Kabakchiev, now tasked withkilling a random passerby.
  Negative
Jed doesn't kill his "gift" using the chainsaw that's put in front of him, but he also doesn't completely abstain from murder.
  Negative
That puts him at odds with Verna, and Texas Ranger Hal Hartman  Stephen Dorff, albeit for very different reasons: Verna wants her boy to kill, and Hartman would rather he didn't.
  Negative
Fast-forward a couple years, when Jed is forcibly separated from his mama and placed in a mental hospital.
  Negative
The children at this hospital are re-named for their own safety, but it seems likely that Jed has grown up to become Bud  Sam Coleman, since he fits the psychological profile of a young serial killer: overweight, awkward, wearing coveralls, near-mute, terrified of women.
  Very negative
So it's no surprise when Bud becomes, after a short period of heavy foregrounding,a supporting character in what appeared to start outas his own story.
  Negative
After all, what kind of hillbilly killer gets to be the star of his own film?
  Negative
Bud tags along during a murderous hospital escape perpetrated by horny killers Clarice  Jessica Madsen, and Ike  James Bloor, and bratty teen Jackson  Sam Strike.
  Negative
Jackson could take or leave all that killing stuff, but Ike and Clarice get off on it.
  Negative
Their designated hostage, empathetic nurse Lizzy  Vanessa Grasse, develops an unconvincing tentative attraction to Jackson.
  Very negative
All the while, Verna and Hal are hot on the kids' trail.
  Positive
Despite this relatively convoluted plot, "Leatherface" isn't really a character-driven piece.
  Negative
Screenwriter  Seth M. Sherwood instead delivers a series of opportunities for co-directors  Alexandre Bustillo and  Julien Maury "Inside," "Livid" to make slick but indistinct tableaux of violence and suffering.
  Negative
Bustillo and Maury don't seem to care about their meat puppet protagonists beyond figuring out the best angle to film actors play-stabbing other performers in the neck, or determining how to undercut their tedious thriller's giddy teens-gone-wild mood with extreme close-upand sub- David Fincher orange-brown filters, as in the emblematically lifeless sequence set in a road-side diner.
  Negative
The latter sceneis especially disappointing since it never stops broadcasting the emotional divide between its overtly punch-drunk pacing and framing and its grisly content.
  Negative
How clever, you might think: a killing spree that's played out like an expression of amoral teenage rebellion.
  Neutral
Surely you can't fault Bustillo and Maury for reveling in violence for its own sake, since they give us ample indications that violence is also a bad thing.
  Negative
Just look at that quick-cut to a victim's gaping eyeball as he bleeds out.
  Negative
Or dig the way that the filmmakers pause for a couple seconds to show another hapless patron begging for her life just before she's blown away.
  Neutral
Surely this should exonerate Bustillo and Maury from killjoy charges of soulless exploitation!
  Negative
Eh, not so much.
  Neutral
Bustillo and Maury have, in the past, successfully delivered shocking, over-the-top gore without destroying their films' comparatively delicate atmosphere of dread.
  Negative
But in "Leatherface," gore, jump cuts and pretty-ugly images are the only things that reveal character.
  Negative
So when Leatherface does, eventually, start to become the famous sociopathic killer we know him to be, it doesn't feel like a loss of innocence, nor does it feel like a gross triumph for misunderstood misfits.
  Negative
It's just a trite ending to a introductory story that never really needed telling.
  Negative
