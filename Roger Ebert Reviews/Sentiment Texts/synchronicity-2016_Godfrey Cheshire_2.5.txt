Synchronicity is a sci-fi noir that attempts to do on a very low budget what its most obvious progenitor,  Ridley Scotts  Blade Runner, did on a much bigger one: dramatize various cosmological imponderables with a sense of doomy wonder and dystopian stylishness.
  Negative
As this films means are too minimal to accommodate stars or gee-whiz special effects, its appeal will likely be limited to avid devotees of its sub-genre.
  Negative
If one did not know that independent writer-director  Jacob Gentry had made previous features, Synchronicity might be taken as a movie made as a film-school MFA thesis.
  Negative
Though its commercial prospects are obviously extremely limited to the point that it mightve made more sense as a straight-to-VOD release it illustrates Gentrys skills in all relevant filmmaking departments to fine effect.
  Positive
From the films opening scenes, its clear the viewer is in low-budget-feature world.
  Positive
The setting is a lab we never know the place or year where an ambitious scientific experiment is underway.
  Negative
After days of hard work, the three scientists involved are all frayed nerves and caffeinated perseverance.
  Negative
But the stakes are huge: project mastermind Jim  Chad McKnight and associates Matty  Scott Poythress and Chuck A.J. Bowen are attempting to tear a wormhole in the space-time continuum and send something through it, proving the viability of time travel.
  Negative
The lab here looks like it mightve cost a few thousand dollars to assemble, with much use of transparent plastic sheeting and whirring machines with knobs and dials that seem like they could date from the s.
  Negative
But Gentry is smart enough not to disguise or apologize for his Ed Wood-level technical means.
  Positive
With admirable conviction, he concentrates on telling the story, showing Jims experiment quickly producing results: a pristine dahlia more a noir reference than a sci-fi one, of course comes through that wormhole, ushering humanity to a new scientific frontier.
  Negative
Complications arise at once, naturally.
  Positive
Jims efforts are being bankrolled by Klaus a strong turn by  Michael Ironside, a domineering, super-rich businessman whose motives are not at all altruistic, to say the least.
  Negative
But a perplexity that seems oddly to arise directly from the experiment itself takes the comely form of Abby  Brianne Davis, who appears just after Jim emerges from the lab and seem to know him already.
  Negative
It gives nothing important away to note that the films shift from acts one to two involves Jims going through the wormhole, with the result that there are soon two Jims one from a week before and the current one.
  Negative
Thus whats set up as a time travel story is less that we never visit the distant past or future  than it is a doppelgnger tale, though the gist here is speculative-scientific rather than psychological-symbolic.
  Negative
Apart from a couple of very minor roles, the five characters named above comprise the films dramatis personae, so the story focuses entirely on their interactions, with the two lab associates of course being less important than the mysteriously motivated Abby and her torrid affair with Jim, and her and both Jims relationships with the menacing, manipulative Klaus.
  Negative
Having such a small number of characters, like the limitations caused by budgetary constraints, might sound like a recipe for creative claustrophobia, but Gentry turns these givens to his advantage, almost as if using Synchronicity to articulate a less-is-more filmmaking philosophy.
  Negative
The movies  minutes remain consistently engaging not only because its narrative twists are mostly smart or intriguing even for those who cant keep a firm grasp of the scientific ideas being bandied but also because cinematographer  Eric Maddison creates an eye-catching visual palette full of noirish shadows and silvery light while Genty composes every frame with understated fluency and expressiveness.
  Positive
Gentry has spoken of the film as having a style thats analog.
  Negative
While that touches on the subliminal appeal of avoiding heavy-handed digital effects, with which too many of our sci-fifantasy films are now entirely overloaded, it also suggests to possibility of the viewer contributing imaginatively to the films feel and meaning and that indeed may be the greatest luxury currently afforded by low-budget filmmaking.
