Finders Keepers is the odyssey of a rogue amputated leg, as found in a grill that was left for months in an abandoned storage locker.
  Negative
After its discovery, two men from Maiden, North Carolina fought for custody of it.
  Negative
John Wood small, sunny-eyed and low-key   was the biological owner of the leg' it was removed from his body after a plane crash, and months later, after his own ways of trying to preserve it as a memorial for his father who died in that crash he ditched the leg in that infamous smoker.
  Negative
However, Shannon Whisnant, towering and with a melodic drawl, was the one who technically bought the grill, and the leg that came with it' he used the publics curiosity about the event, the grill, and the foot to become a bit of a local celebrity.
  Neutral
In pure poetry, Shannon has a bum left leg, the same side as the amputated limb.
  Negative
The two took their odd but straight-faced quarrel to international media, eventually leaving the foots fate up to an appearance on reality TV court show Judge Mathis.
  Negative
Needless to say, this is a story that tells itself.
  Positive
If some documentary filmmakers are like gold miners, scouring to find a phenomenal nonfictional story within heaps and heaps of less-interesting ones, Finders Keepers is that piece of gold which directors  Bryan Carberry and J.  Clay Tweel were lucky to find before anyone else did.
  Negative
This is a story that comes with rich, fascinating subjects, atmosphere, fantastic dialogue, He thought he was gonna be, yknow, the next  Billy Bob Thornton!
  Positive
insatiable costume design, and a bizarre chain of events, all waiting for a documentarians vision as is often the case, fiction film could never do this justice.
  Negative
At one time, this was the type of pursuit that led to  Errol Morris  Gates of Heaven.
  Negative
Now, in the spirit of that albeit untouchable film we have Finders Keepers, a fantastic story that touches upon all-American notions of celebrity, redemption, family, justice, class, meme culture all which came together with a kooky news segment.
  Positive
This Sundance  selection and winner of Best Comedy at the  Traverse City Film Festival is a ridiculous story indeed, as Johns mother Peg will state herself, or the grin on his brother-in-law Tom will nudge, as he shares his talking head offerings like he were about to finish telling a joke.
  Neutral
But Finders Keepers succeeds with a staggering amount of empathy when its narrative focuses on more than a prized foot, and centers on two men experiencing life phenomenons bigger than them.
  Positive
The film invests a lot of time in talking head reflections of John's addictions, and the apex of self-destruction he hit because of the money and attention given to him by the foot fiasco.
  Negative
Meanwhile, Shannon tries to understand his degree of celebrity, boasting big dreams of becoming a beloved, wealthy entertainer through his reality show appearances' a fantastic but crushing moment in the third act shows Shannon experiencing first-hand a reality show audiences attention span for him as The Foot Man."
  Negative
Inserted news reports label these eccentric events as a freak show but Finders Keepers unquestionably resists a mean spirit.
  Negative
This doc doesnt get into the type of designation of heroes and villains, as previously chosen previously by one of its producers,  Seth Gordon, who broke into filmmaking with s King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters.
  Negative
Although that docs nemesis Billy Mitchell does get an Awesome Thanks in this films closing credits.
  Negative
Finders Keepers wisely and warmly treats John and Shannon, both Davids to society as a Goliath, with a caring touch, expressing their very human nature defined by the comedy and tragedy within each.
  Positive
Their story is immensely entertaining, but the lunacy of these events is never out of their own understanding.
  Positive
Carberry amp' Tweel are pretty sharp as to how much the story tells itself, and often dont mess with its natural order.
  Negative
On the other hand, aside from some driving score choices, or some select, pretty shots of B-roll, its as if the filmmaking loses personality to the eccentricities of everyone on screen.
  Negative
And in terms of assembly, Finders Keepers is a tad messy we know that reenactments were filmed earlier than the leads dominating interviews per Shannons haircut as a time mark, but we arent sure where the filming exactly takes place in the overall foot saga, especially as the impressions John and Shannon have on each other seem to change throughout.
  Negative
Its an unnecessary distraction that overcomplicates a story that proves to have a beautiful, simple grace.
  Negative
In a very rare reflex even for themovies I already treasure, I was moved to watch "Finders Keepers" again immediately after the first viewing.This documentary is just so welcoming and for events that defy believability that I wanted more time in its atmosphere the -minute running time is still just right.
  Negative
Sometimes you just find something that grabs ahold of you.
  Positive
In one of "Finders Keepers'" greatest gifts, it is inspiring how clear and clean the filmmaker'sintentions are, especially against public opinion's regular impulse to quantify unusual headline subjects as memes from a -minute circus the film wonderfully continues theideasfrom the end of " Amy," which is also one of the best documentaries of the year.
  Very positive
"Finders Keepers" is able to pack in all of this bizarre tale's inherently kooky colors and have a great deal of fun with them but its heart isalways in the right place.
  Positive
