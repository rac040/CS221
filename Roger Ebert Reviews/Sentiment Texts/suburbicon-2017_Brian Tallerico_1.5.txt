Its tempting to criticize  George Clooneys Suburbicon as two films that never quite coalesce into one complete whole, which is partially true.
  Negative
But that might give the impression that either film works on their own, which is false.
  Negative
This startling misfire is a tonal disaster from start to finish, whether residing in the dark comedy that retains echoes of the Coen brothers original script or in the more earnestly inspirational true story of a black family who gets run out of white America.
  Very negative
Other than when the movie appears to levitate for a brief period while  Oscar Isaac is on-screen, the dull Suburbicon lacks in witty dialogue, interesting characters, or even visual flourishes.
  Negative
It is as flat as the well-manicured lawns in the idyllic neighborhood that gives it a name.
  Negative
Two stories compete for screen time but never really intertwine in the script by George Clooney and  Grant Heslov, who developed a script also still-credited to  Joel Coen and  Ethan Coen, so well tackle them separately.
  Positive
In the one thats likely to remind people of recent events in Charlottesville and elsewhere, a black family moves into the until-then-white Suburbicon, and instantly faces backlash.
  Very negative
Based on the true story of what happened to William  Leith M. Burke and Daisy Meyers  Karimah Westbrook in Levittown in August , this half of the movie feels like underdeveloped manipulation.
  Negative
We never get to know William at all Im not sure he even has a line but we see Daisy being told milk costs  at the local store and the whole family getting harassed by mobs outside their home every night.
  Negative
The mobs get louder and more violent as the film progresses to the tragic inevitable.
  Negative
While the Meyers family is being targeted merely for the color of their skin, a different kind of evil is going down in the white house next door.
  Negative
And one has to assume this is Clooneys point that murderous white people are getting away with it while communities are blinded by racist anger even if that doesnt seem like enough on which to really thematically hang a film.
  Negative
While the Meyers just want to live the lives promised them in the Suburbicon brochure, Gardner Lodge  Matt Damon is having his family torn apart.
  Negative
One average night, two men  Glenn Fleshler and  Alex Hassell break into the Lodge house and chloroform the whole family, including Gardners wife  Julianne Moore and son Nicky  Noah Jupe.
  Negative
Mrs. Lodge dies but is quickly replaced in the family unit by her twin sister Margaret also Julianne Moore, of course.
  Negative
Nicky suspects something strange is going on here, the killers come by Gardners office with demands, and Oscar Isaac shows up after about an hour as a suspicious insurance investigator.
  Positive
The dividing line between the Coen film and the ClooneyHeslov film is crystal clear, and one can see the foundation of a black noir Coen comedy with a sense of humor not unlike  Fargo and  Burn After Reading.
  Positive
That kind of comedy is tough to pull off tonally and Clooney the director doesnt have the rhythm to do so.
  Positive
Suburbicon is shockingly unfunny, mostly due to the leaden, shapeless direction of it all but also performances from Damon and Moore that never seem to settle on a tone or character.
  Very negative
Theyre lifeless.
  Negative
Maybe purposefully?
  Neutral
As a commentary on dull white middle America?
  Negative
Thats possible, but not entertaining in any way.
  Positive
Only Isaac and Fleshler a little bit have any energy.
  Negative
It feels like he just came from the set of a better, funnier, more interesting movie.
  Negative
Part of the tonal problem here is one of deeply unlikable characters, something that the Coens excel at but other directors, even collaborators of theirs, have difficulty managing.
  Negative
Gardner Lodge isnt a memorable anti-hero hes kind of just a loathsome creep.
  Negative
Almost as if they recognize that, Clooney amp' Heslov try to tell the story through the eyes of Nicky, but that shift doesnt quite work either.
  Negative
This is the story of a kid learning his parents arent perfect and all of his neighbors are violent racists.
  Positive
Without any humor or interesting characters to keep the film entertaining, thats a tough premise for a movie.
  Negative
And its tonally impossible to balance.
  Negative
It makes Suburbicon a comedy with almost no laughs and a drama with no depth.
  Negative
The movie even starts to grate aesthetically with an overdone score by  Alexandre Desplat and design elements that fetishize s America in an incomplete way, stranding the movie between parody and realism.
  Negative
Even the great  Robert Elswits work here feels uninspired.
  Negative
Of course, it all comes back to the flaws of a director unable to figure out what story hes trying to convey or an intriguing way to tell it.
  Negative
Suburbicon doesnt so much tell two stories that never coalesce into one it doesnt tell any interesting story at all.
