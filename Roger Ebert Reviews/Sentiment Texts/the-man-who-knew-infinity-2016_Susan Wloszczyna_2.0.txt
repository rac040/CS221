We do love our male geniuses these days.
  Positive
Even more so, apparently, if their presence ever graced the hallowed halls of Cambridge at some point.
  Negative
And if they faced a major hurdle in life, such as a debilitating disease, closeted homosexuality or control freak issues?
  Neutral
That only humanizes the bright fellow all the more.
  Negative
Of course, behind every great man must be a self-sacrificing woman who stands by their side or, otherwise, there would be no emotional pull to balance all that complex geek-speak chatter.
  Negative
No matter that the lives of many of these ladies often would provide enough material for a potentially fascinating film all on their own.
  Positive
That was certainly the case with s  The Theory of Everything, with  Eddie Redmayne in his Oscar-winning role as astrophysicist  Stephen Hawking, and  The Imitation Game that same year, featuring  Benedict Cumberbatchs Oscar-nominated performance as World War II code breaker Alan Turing.
  Negative
And, although he was primarily a product of Silicon Valley, add s  Steve Jobs starring the Oscar-nominated  Michael Fassbender to the list.
  Negative
Now arrives The Man Who Knew Infinity, which on the surface looks like a potentially rich variation on this smarty-pants fact-based genre.
  Negative
The innovator this time is Srinivasa Ramanujan, a self-taught Indian mathematician whose contributions to the field were considered massive enough to have inspired a Google doodle on the th anniversary of his birth in .
  Negative
We are told early on that he is the most romantic figure in the recent history of mathematics, which is quite a billing to live up to.
  Very positive
The details of Ramanujans backstory certainly have cinematic potential, including East vs. West conflicts.
  Positive
Theres a soap-operatic arranged marriage to a pretty wife he barely knew and a possessive mother.
  Negative
He was a devoted practitioner of his Hindu faith and viewed his intuitive knowledge as a God-bestowed gift.
  Positive
And he professed a desperate desire to allow his uncanny ability for doing seemingly impossible calculations in his head to get its full due by sailing , miles to Trinity College in Cambridge, where the very tree that held the apple that fell on Sir Isaac Newtons head stands in the grassy courtyard.
  Negative
But while The Theory of Everything relied on clever visuals to emblemize Hawkings innovative thinking and The Imitation Game had that giant proto-computer clicking away to stand in for Turings ingenuity, there is little more than few scribbled equations and notebooks to convey what Ramanujan presented to the world, before dying from TB at age .
  Negative
Yes, something called partition function is explained at length.
  Negative
But why it matters so much and what it means in a practical sense, I could not say.
  Negative
What purports to be a celebration of the power of numbers should by all rights be the opposite of math-phobic.
  Negative
However, the filmmakers behind The Man Who Knew Infinitydidnt want to make their movie feel like homework.
  Neutral
But an account of a remarkable person should strive to be as equally remarkable as its subject, not the timid and tidy boilerplate special of a biopic that The Man Who Knew Infinity too often resembles.
  Negative
What we are left with is a narrative that is primarily driven by its central odd-couple relationship, amid cultural clashes and bigotry.
  Negative
The story begins just as World War I looms as an impoverished Ramanujan  Dev Patel works as a lowly clerk in an accounting house in his homeland.
  Negative
He decides to write a letter to the formidable Cambridge mathematician G.H. Hardy  Jeremy Irons, exuding his usual upper-class whiff of superiority but in academic form, asking to be allowed to further his pursuits at the school.
  Negative
Initially, a skeptical Hardy thinks the missive is a joke, even if he is tempted by the examples of the formulas inside.
  Negative
But his far-cuddlier colleague John Littlewood  Toby Jones urges him to take a chance and beckon Ramanujan abroad.
  Negative
At least those in charge of casting knew what they were doing when they paired Irons and Patel.
  Neutral
Rather than the youthful unease of Patels  Slumdog Millionaire breakthrough, Ramanujan requires a sense of obsessive urgency and unwavering self-confidence about his destiny.
  Very negative
The actor captures these traits perfectly without resorting to off-putting bravado or compromising his abundant natural appeal, from his characters purposeful stride to his insistent declarations of his belief in himself.
  Positive
Meanwhile, Irons is the gawky one.
  Negative
His Hardy is a socially inept bachelor who is ill-suited to the role of nurturing mentor and father figure.
  Negative
But somehow both men learn to rise above any differences, eventually striking a mathematical balance between Ramanujans spontaneous intuitive approach and Hardys insistence on rigorous discipline and supportive proof.
  Positive
That helps to bolster their defense against the objections of the narrow-minded Cambridge establishment some of whom derisively refer to Hardys protg as Gunga Din into accepting this outsider genius into their fold.
  Negative
Eventually, war breaks out the low-budget film somehow manages a shot of a hovering zeppelin and a military hospital is set up on campus.
  Negative
Ramanujan neglects his health he has a hard time maintaining his vegetarian diet during food rationing while his lonely wife Janaki  Devika Bhise pines away in India and his mother forgets to mail her countless letters requesting to visit him.
  Negative
Naturally, a final-act triumph of sorts is all but assured.
  Positive
And, thanks in large part to Irons and Patel, audiences will be moved.
  Positive
But even they cant hide the fact that The Man Who Knew Infinity is missing some essential elements in its true-story equation.
  Negative
Sometimes, engaging the brain can be as equally essential as touching the heart.
  Positive
