It has all the trappings of a tasteful period piece: the true-story origins, the tweedy collegiate setting, the to-die-for costumes.
  Positive
But beneath all that, Professor Marston and the Wonder Women aims to shake you up, make you think and maybe even squirm a little.

Make that a lot.
  Neutral
This movie is sexy as hell, featuring several scenes of steamy three-ways and kinky Samp'M games.
  Negative
Luke Evans as the title character and  Rebecca Hall and  Bella Heathcote as the two great loves of his life have ridiculous, combustible chemistry in and out of the bedroom as well as the many other locations, public and private, where they dared to explore their shared love at a time when the rest of the world definitely wasnt ready for it.
  Negative
But Professor Marston  also couldnt be more relevant, and not just because it happens to be hitting theaters just four months after the release of the smash-hit blockbuster  Wonder Woman.
  Negative
Its a timely affirmation of feminine power of the ways in which female wisdom and strength can charge hearts and minds, influence culture and inspire others to be their most authentic selves.
  Very positive
That was certainly true of this summers origin story, with its deeply moving lead performance from  Gal Gadot, and its true again here in the origin story behind that origin story.
  Very positive
It takes a little while for the beloved superhero to come into full blossom, but her iconography is there, emerging steadily in illuminating, amusing ways.
  Positive
Unfortunately, though, writerdirector  Angela Robinson relies on a back-and-forth narrative structure which has been used in so many biopics, its become a clich to tell the tale of how the comic book heroine and her alter ego, Diana Prince, came into being.
  Negative
At the films start in the mid-s, Evans William Marston  who created Wonder Woman under the pseudonym Charles Moulton is being interrogated about the characters scandalous, sadomasochistic imagery by the head of the Child Study Association of America, the uptight Josette Frank  Connie Britton.

  Positive
The energy between the two crackles long before they begin sharing their lab and, eventually, their bed with Olive Byrne Heathcote, a Radcliffe student who initially enters their lives as a research assistant.
  Negative
The couple cant deny their joint attraction for the bright, beautiful blonde and she, in turn, falls for them both, which shes forced to admit in an exquisitely tense scene involving an early version of a lie detector.
  Positive
The Marstons are crediting with coming up with the device.
  Positive
Their sexual frolicking leads to dress-up and bondage when Marston brings his two loves to the backroom of a costume shop for a secret rope-play course and the corset, boots and ropes they employ might look a little familiar.
  Negative
Cinematographer  Bryce Fortners dramatic use of silhouette lighting during this scene adds to its warm, intimate power and, yes, its wonder.
  Positive
Early on, though, we had a hint that this might be a shared turn-on when the couple spies on Olive paddling a sorority pledge during a hazing ritual supposedly as research for their theories on dominance and submission.
  Negative
And conversely, we can tell from the way Heathcotes big, blue eyes widen even more that Olive is enjoying being watched.

  Positive
