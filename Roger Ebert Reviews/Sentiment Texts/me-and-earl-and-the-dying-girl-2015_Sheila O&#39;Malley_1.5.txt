If you grew up, as I did, watching old black-and-white movies on a local television channel, then you know the experience of learning young that there is a whole world of movies outside the ones shown at the multiplex.
  Negative
"Me and Earl and the Dying Girl," the baffling Sundance hit it won both the Audience Award and the Grand Jury Prize, directed by  Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, with a script by  Jesse Andrews, based on his best-selling novel, features two teenage characters obsessed with the Great Movies.
  Positive
Other than that acquisitive movie-mad mindset, it is a pandering, self-flattering mess, featuring unearned catharsis, lazy clichs and characters presented in broad, sometimes-offensive stereotypes.
  Very negative
The worst part is that "Me and Earl" believes it is aware of all of this.
  Neutral
Every clich arrives with a wink of self-knowing commentary before it, to say, "Yes, we know this is a cliche, but we are making a commentabout the clich!"
  Negative
Saying it don't make it so.
  Negative
Besides, such commentary has been done before, and it's been done much better.
  Very negative
There's a laziness at work in "Me and Earl," a reliance on well-trod ground and over-chewed cultural tropes, and perhaps it is supposed to be that way these are kids who see everything through the lens of their movie-watching, but it still doesn't work.
  Negative
The winks about the clichs, including the one in the title, only serve to point up how tired those clichs are.
  Negative
Greg  Thomas Mann is a detached and depressive teenager, who resists emotional involvement to such a degree that he can't even admit that his best friend since childhood, Earl  RJ Cyler, is his best friend.
  Negative
He refers to Earl, instead, as a "co-worker."
  Negative
He and Earl grew up watching movies like  Werner Herzog's "Aguirre The Wrath of God", Truffaut's " The  Blows," Powell and Pressberger's "Tales of Hoffmann," and spend their free time as teenagers making their own movies, spoofs of the greats with titles like "The  Bros," "The Sockwork Orange," and " : p.m. Cowboy."
  Negative
One day Greg's mother  Connie Britton orders him to go visit Rachel  Olivia Cooke, a classmate just diagnosed with cancer.
  Negative
Greg does not even know Rachel, but he shows up at her house, and is immediately lusted over by Rachel's boozy mother  Molly Shannon, who answers the door with a drink in her hand, cooing about who is this "delicious," "yummy" young man.
  Negative
Rachel is confused as to why Greg is there, annoyed even, and Greg begs to be allowed to hang out with her, just for one day, so he can report back to his mother.
  Negative
Because of course, it is a dying girl's responsibility to make the world okay for everyone in her midst, to be inspirational, to teach people how to love, how to live even strangers who show up at her door on a charity mission.
  Positive
At one point he says, "Please appreciate how honest I just was."
  Positive
A valid answer to that statement would be, "No.
  Negative
I'm dying.
  Negative
I don't know you.
  Negative
Go away."
  Neutral
The whole point of "Me and Earl and the Dying Girl" is that through his relationship with Rachel, Greg starts to live for someone other than himself.
  Negative
He and Earl decide to make a movie for Rachel, a tribute, and they hurry to finish it before she dies.
  Negative
Teenagers are self-involved.
  Neutral
Learning to live in the world, to recognize that others exist, that your actions have consequences, is a part of growing up.
  Positive
Authors like  Paul Zindel, S.E. Hinton, and, more recently,  John Green, all wrote books featuring teenagers who have to learn, sometimes painfully, that who they are has meaning, that they have to be responsible for themselves, and kind to others.
  Negative
"Me and Earl" wants to be a part of that genre without bothering to create characters that live.
  Positive
Earl is another problem.
  Negative
Earl is black.
  Neutral
For no other reason, apparently, he lives in squalor on a terrifying-looking street of derelict houses, overrun by weeds, and has a scary aggressive brother with a pit bull.
  Negative
Earl speaks with profanity-laced language, and constantly asks Greg about Rachel's "titties."
  Positive
Has Greg seentouched the "titties" yet?
  Negative
Earl's language is completely unmotivated, coming from nowhere, and therefore represents a failure of the imagination when it comes to the character.
  Very negative
Who is Earl?
  Neutral
I'd actually like to know.
  Positive
How does he feel about the films they watch?
  Neutral
What's his take?
  Neutral
Later, when Greg has hurt Rachel's feelings, Earl steps up in a big way, showing that he has more common sense and more of an understanding of what is at stake for Rachel than Greg does.
  Positive
This is also a clich: the black sidekick understanding more about matters of the heart than the white lead.
  Neutral
Greg's friendship with Rachel, despite its inauspicious beginning, does develop.
  Positive
They hang out.
  Neutral
They talk.
  Neutral
Or, rather, Greg talks, and she listens.
  Neutral
He shows her the movies he made with Earl.
  Positive
If you were a teenage girl dying of cancer, with a group of supportive friends already, a terrified mother, and a unique artistic sensibility of your own which we discover later, how would you like to spend your last months on earth?
  Negative
In "Me and Earl and the Dying Girl," the "girl" of the title devotes the ending stretch of her life into making a young guy she never knew before feel good about himself and his artistic pursuits.
  Positive
The glimpses we get of Earl and Greg's movies are the best part of the film.
  Positive
They're goofy and dumb, and Alfonso Gomez-Rejon had a lot of fun, obviously, creating all of them.
  Negative
There are moments that flash with humor, like Greg filling out his college application in the voice of Werner Herzog.
  Positive
The camera-work is energetic, albeit a bit too artificial and showy placing heads over on the side of the frame for no real reason.
  Positive
One scene, a tense argument between Rachel and Greg, plays out in one long take and it's the only time in the film when something real is actually allowed to exist, because in such a scene it is about the behavior, the silences between the words, the sense you get that two actors are actually creating something before your eyes.
  Negative
Such a scene, however, cannot save the whole.
  Negative
That line mentioned earlier, "Please appreciate how honest I just was," sums up the systemic problems with "Me and Earl and the Dying Girl."
  Negative
The film wants to be congratulated for being honest.
  Neutral
But it isn't honest at all.
  Negative
