There is a lot of discourse these days about cultural whitewashing, a practice both vexing and widespread.
  Positive
Its not just a matter of casting a non-Asian in an Asian role.
  Positive
It happens in ways that people are so used to that it might not occur to them, and for reasons that filmmakers will insist have to do with audiences actual preferences.
  Negative
Lets take this film, a well-meaning and sometimes interesting effort written and directed by brothers Jeff and  Michael Zimbalist.
  Positive
It tells the story of the soccer player Edson Arantes de Nascimento, known worldwide by his nickname Pel.
  Negative
The movie recounts his early life up until , the crucial year in which the then--year-old helped clinch a World Cup victory against Sweden.
  Negative
The movie begins with an audio montage of plumy accents telling of the devotion of Brazilian soccer fans and the revolutionary impact of a not yet-adult player.
  Negative
"Pel: Birth of a Legend" flashes back to the very early childhood of said revolutionary player, and while its outline is true to Pels true life he did triumph over poverty to become one of the greatest talents and stars the world of sports has ever known its specifics all fall into the land of clich.
  Positive
Young Edson is mocked by rich kids, belongs to a mischievous little group of poor boys that comes complete with a jolly portly kid, the local adults are all transfixed by sports on the radio, a mentor advises the young wannabe soccer player that if you want to play professionally, you cant be ashamed of who you are.
  Positive
While all the persons of color in this film are played by persons of color, the movie whitewashes Brazil itself just by having all of its characters speak in English.
  Negative
The denial of language, to my mind, constitutes as much of a cultural betrayal as substitute casting.
  Negative
But even Pel himself, who contributes a charming cameo in the film and he looks great, too' youd never guess that hell turn  this year would likely tell you that in international productions that expect to make their money back in English-speaking countries, the mass audience wont sit still for subtitles.
  Negative
Theres also the movies soundtrack score, which seems desirous to give the impression that Jorge Ben Jor's  Ponta de Lana Africano Umbabarauma was a musical point of reference back in .
  Negative
Between the whitewashing factors and the very familiar narrative beats, theres a lot of this movie thats not much more than a tolerable drag.
  Negative
Things pick up when they get specific, that is, during the scenes in which Pels exuberant, rhythmic, body-attack method of soccer play a proud, African-derived style called Ginga comes into conflict with the European-based formation style of play.
  Negative
Ginga is dismissed by old hands as primitive, and the gruff soccer coach Feola played in typically dyspeptic mode by Vincent DOnofrio, one of the few cast members to apply a kind of Brazilian lilt to his speech strongly discourages his mixed-race team from using it.
  Negative
Until, that is, he witnesses the kind of results Pel, who set a goal-scoring record in  that holds to this day, is able to achieve with it.
  Positive
I would be happier with a documentary on Ginga narrated by the man himself.
  Negative
With subtitles, even.
  Neutral
