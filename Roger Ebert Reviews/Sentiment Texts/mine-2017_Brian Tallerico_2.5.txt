Fabio Guaglione amp'  Fabio Resinaros Mine is practically a one-man show.
  Negative
There are tech elements that are essential to its success, but this film lives and dies on what  Armie Hammer does at its center.
  Neutral
Hes not only in every scene, hes often the only person in the scene, playing a guy trapped in the middle of nowhere and reflecting on exactly how he got there.
  Negative
Hammer is riding a wave of success and acclaim, appearing in The Birth of a Nation and  Nocturnal Animals last year and about to blow people away in Call Me By Your Name later this year.
  Negative
Its easy to see him becoming one of his generations most interesting actors.
  Positive
And when that happens people will come back to this relatively small thriller and appreciate how hes had the skills for some time now.
  Positive
Every time that Mine threatens to come apart under its own pretensions which is relatively often, Hammer does something subtle and believable to ground it.
  Positive
Mike Hammer is a sniper' Tommy  Tom Cullen is his spotter.
  Negative
They are on a ridge, on assignment in a dusty land, when it looks like their target is in sight.
  Negative
A convoy comes over the horizon, met by another group of people in the sand.
  Negative
Over the radio, Mike hears that their target is in the last car, but the color is wrong.
  Negative
Mike hesitates.
  Neutral
What if this is the wrong guy?
  Neutral
And the situation is complicated even further when Mike and Tommy realize that the group below them is gathered for a wedding.
  Negative
Is Mike really going to shoot the father of the bride at a ceremony when hes not even positive its the right guy?
  Negative
He hesitates long enough that the situation goes haywire, and Mike and Tommy are forced to walk hours to the nearest village.
  Negative
Then Tommy steps on a land mine.
  Neutral
And so does Mike.
  Neutral
Much like  Buried or  The Shallows trapped their protagonist in a specific place, Mike literally cant move his left foot or risk going boom.
  Negative
He calls in the disastrous situation theyre in and is told that someone can come rescue him  in  hours.
  Negative
He considers something daring called The Shoeman Maneuver that involves basically digging a trench next to you and then trying to fall in it in time to minimize damage.
  Negative
If youre lucky, youll only lose a leg.
  Negative
He has to deal with sandstorms, running out of water, and animals in the middle of the night.
  Negative
And then he starts going crazy, flashing back to his abusive father and a wife he left behind.
  Negative
Mine is unapologetically philosophical.
  Neutral
We all have land mines in our life that were not willing to step off, dude.
  Negative
Its a film in which a character literally says, Every day can be your last step.
  Positive
Oh, really?
  Neutral
Thanks.
  Neutral
In remembered moments of his past that got him here, we literally hear a mine sound, as if Mike has stepped on them symbolically before.
  Negative
We get it.
  Negative
Mine is the kind of movie in which you will even likely say, out loud, We get it, at least once.
  Negative
It hammers its themes and messages, and then hammers them again and again and again.
  Negative
While its clear that the filmmakers were somewhat scared of the simplicity of their concept in the way they weigh it down with flashbacks and messaging, the real tragedy is that Hammer could have pulled off a real one-man show.
  Negative
He does some of the hardest work of his career here, conveying both the trauma of his situation and the baggage that Mike brought with him to the desert.
  Positive
We believe that Mike is likely going to die eaten by animals, blown up by a mine, or simply dying of thirst.
  Negative
Its odd to say that Hammer gives a physical performance given hes stuck in one place, but he remarkably sells his predicament as a real, dangerous one.
  Negative
The film works because of him with a shout-out to excellent editing by Filippo Mauro Boni, Guaglione, and Matteo Santi, too.
  Negative
Its a really good performance from an actor I suspect will give several great ones over the course of his career.
  Very positive
