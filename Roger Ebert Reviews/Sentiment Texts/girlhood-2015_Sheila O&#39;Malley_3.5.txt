Cline Sciamma's films are delicate and emotional examinations of, to quote Madonna, "what it feels like for a girl."
  Neutral
Sciamma has directed three features thus far: "Water Lilies," " Tomboy," and now "Girlhood" and each one takes on a different sliver of the spectrum of adolescent or pre-adolescent girlhood.
  Negative
Girls are not a monolith, they are not all the same, they are not "the other," although you'd never know it considering some of the films out there.
  Negative
It takes an intuitive and devoted filmmaker like Sciamma to go beneath the surface of "girlhood", to remove the normal trappings, and to look at all of the different forces and influences in play.
  Negative
"Girlhood," her latest, is a powerful and entertaining film about a gang of girls, and what friendship means, the protection it provides.
  Very positive
"Girlhood" follows Marieme the extraordinary  Karidja Tour through her th year.
  Positive
She lives in a big housing project, and is the main caretaker of her younger sister.
  Positive
Her grades are poor and she is being pushed to transfer to a technical school and learn a trade.
  Negative
Her mother Binta Diop works so many jobs she is never around, and Marieme has to answer to her brother Cyril Mendy, who is downright abusive.
  Very negative
Marieme is a sweet and shy girl, her hair falling down her back in braids.
  Neutral
One day three tough Rizzo-types, lolling on the bleachers, summon her over to their pow-wow.
  Negative
Their motivations aren't clear at first.
  Negative
Marieme seems much younger than these glamour girls, all of whom wear long straight weaves, identical gold necklaces, and red lipstick.
  Negative
The cliche is that the "bad girls" will "corrupt" the good girl.
  Negative
But Sciamma is up to something different, thank goodness.
  Positive
These three girls are Lady the wonderful Assa Sylla, the leader of the pack, and the two humorous underlings, Fily Maritou Tour and Adiatou Lindsay Karamoh.
  Very positive
They need a "fourth" to round out their group.
  Neutral
They're trouble-makers, engaged in fighting with another group of girls' nothing too serious, just a lot of screaming insults across train platforms.
  Negative
Marieme enters the group dynamic: the four girls hustle, they shop-lift, they book hotel rooms and eat pizza.
  Negative
The gang of girls do not initiate Marieme into a dangerous world of drugs and sex.
  Negative
No, the tough girls initiate her into a world of belonging, of fun trash-talk, an environment where she can let loose, try on makeup and a different hairstyle for her friends' benefit, not for any romantic prospect's benefit, and experiment a little bit with identity.
  Neutral
The new persona might not "fit" Marieme, ultimately, but she's  years old.
  Negative
She's figuring it out.
  Neutral
Life is tough out there, and the girls are aware of it.
  Positive
There are pimp-type guys starting to show interest in them, circling like sharks.
  Positive
There are judgmental fathers and brothers, who shame the girls for growing up, for wanting to stretch their wings a little bit, sexually.
  Negative
Marieme starts to date, tentatively, a boy she's known forever, named Ismal  Idrissa Diabat.
  Negative
Their scenes together offer a sweet space where both can allow themselves to be tender, in contrast to the closed-up toughness required in their larger world.
  Positive
They click.
  Neutral
But it feels precarious.
  Negative
The girls watch their friends get knocked up and, for all intents and purposes, vanish from the world.
  Neutral
They don't want that for themselves.
  Negative
They want  something else, something more.
  Neutral
Freedom.
  Neutral
Liberty.
  Neutral
To be left alone.
  Neutral
What Sciamma is interested in is "moments."
  Neutral
There are many moments that linger in the mind long after the film has ended.
  Positive
The epic slo-mo all-female football game of the opening.
  Positive
An early scene showing a raucous group of girls heading back to the projects, all talking at once, until they fall into silence, collectively, when they approach a group of boys lounging on the steps.
  Negative
The repeat shots of the back of Marieme's head throughout, breaking "Girlhood" up into unofficial "chapters."
  Negative
Marieme washing dishes, emerging into the concrete yard outside, the camera following her, her head facing out.
  Negative
Sciamma started "Tomboy" with the back of a head as well, a head with shorn-short hair, looking away, creating an automatic confusion as to whether it was a boy or a girl, the whole theme of the film.
  Negative
In "Girlhood," there are fight scenes and a hilarious miniature-golf excursion, as well as many painful reminders that no, they will not be left alone, the world cannot leave the girls alone.
  Negative
A masterpiece scene comes halfway through, so powerful in its representation of shared joy and freedom that it sets off echoes around it that continue throughout the rest of the film.
  Very positive
The girls have shop-lifted pretty dresses, and booked a hotel room where they can hang out for the night, maybe go out to a club later in their stolen goods.
  Negative
There's a sense of exhilaration in the moment, and the four get up and start dancing together to Rihannas Diamonds.
  Positive
The light is a deep blue, and the girls are jumping and laughing and loving each other's awesomeness for almost the entirety of the song.
  Positive
All four are in the frame at the same time.
  Neutral
Sciamma has given us what feels like a real event, a real moment, one of those precious moments in time that the girls might look back on and think, "That.
  Positive
That was good."
  Positive
The final section of "Girlhood" doesn't quite have the energy of the rest of it, although Karidja Tour is such a compelling presence, and Marieme is such a watchable character, that her experiences create a tension all their own.
  Positive
What will become of Marieme?
  Neutral
The group friendship is formative, powerful, for all of them, it is something they treasure and cling to, but they're also just teenage girls.
  Positive
They're not sure yet what is going to be the most important thing in their lives.
  Positive
Comparisons will be made, inevitably, to Richard Linklater's " Boyhood," merely because of the title.
  Neutral
They are two very different films.
  Neutral
Sciamma's films could all go under the title "Girlhood."
  Neutral
Her films do not diagnose.
  Neutral
They don't worry at least not overtly.
  Negative
They do not assume that "girlhood" is mostly an experience of inevitable derailment.
  Negative
Adolescence is a time of growth and change, of trying on new identities, seeing which one fits the best.
  Very positive
Girls "come of age" just like boys do, but many films take the attitude that it's more dangerous for girls to experiment.
  Positive
That might be partially true, because of pregnancy, but it is not entirely true.
  Negative
"We Are the Best!"
  Positive
was a terrific antidote to that prevalent teenage-girls-in-peril narrative, and so is "Girlhood."
  Positive
It's not that Sciamma sugar-coats the dangers that are out there.
  Negative
It is that she is more interested in how girls figure things out than in the many ways girls can go wrong.
  Negative
