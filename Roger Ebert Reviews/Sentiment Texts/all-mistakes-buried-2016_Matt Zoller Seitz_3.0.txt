"All Mistakes Buried," a thriller about a junkie seeking redemption through one of those fabled Big Scores, is proof that in movies, the strength of a tale usually lies in the telling.
  Positive
There's nothing in this film by director  Tim McCann "Desolation Angels" that you have not, in one sense or another, seen before.
  Negative
But it's executed with such passion that it holds together better than you might expect.
  Positive
Shot in Louisiana, with a soundtrack full of whirring cicadas and  interstate traffic sounds, the movie seems to be taking place in  the mind of its hero, Sonny  Sam Trammell of "True Blood", a once  successful small businessman who lost his fortune and became a drug addict.
  Negative
Sonny  lives in a scuzzy motel, smokes crack whenever he can get it, and obsesses over the days when he was  comfortably married to his kindhearted wife, Jen  Missy Yager, and  running a successful home security operation.
  Very negative
The story is built around an escalating series of offenses.
  Negative
First Sonny shoplifts a greeting card that he means to give to Jen on her birthday.
  Negative
Then he sneaks into a pawn shop and hides there until closing time to steal or perhaps reclaim a necklace for Jen.
  Neutral
By the end of the film, he's gotten pulled into a wild, dangerous, major crime that he also justifies in Jen's name.
  Neutral
He says all about his wife, but it's really all about Sonny his arrogance, his embarrassment at having lost so much, his craving for vindication and renewal.
  Negative
The film's screenplay is by McCann and  Shaun S. Sanghani, from a story by Trammell and McCann.
  Negative
Its outline is very s film noir, set in around a nightmarish fringe that exists adjacent to, or beneath, respectable society.
  Negative
This world is populated mainly by junkies, prostitutes and pimps' a hard-boiled madam  Vanessa Ferlito of "Graceland," whose character has a past connection to Sonny' the night managers of a seedy motel' snarling nightclub owners' armed robbers and the like.
  Negative
They're mostly a tough, even cruel bunch.
  Neutral
Look at them wrong and they'll beat you to a pulp.
  Negative
As in earlier films by McCann, one of the largely unsung auteurs of American Scuzzpit Cinema, the world of "All Mistakes Buried" feels like the product of journalistic study or even experience secondhand, one hopes.
  Negative
There's none of that Hollywood crime movie nonsense: beautiful people with beautiful teeth and beautiful hair and gorgeous clothes smoking on street corners and barking threats at each other while carefully chosen pop and rap songs blare on the soundtrack.
  Positive
These characters feel real, so real that you can smell their sour sweat and the stench of urine and spilled beer.
  Negative
McCann has used actual ex-convicts as actors in some of his other movies, and it would not be surprised to learn that he's done the same here.
  Negative
But rather than tell its story in a strictly linear way, as an old or mainstream film might, "All Mistakes Buried" flashes back and forth through the hero's recent life in a prismatic fashion.
  Positive
The brilliant editing, by McCann and  Chris Kursel, is reminiscent of arty s and 's films that applied the techniques of literary fiction to pulp thriller material: "Point Blank" and its unofficial spiritual remake " The Limey" are especially strong reference points here, especially when "All Mistakes Buried" leaves exposition behind and dives into a fugue state, blending past and present in a free-associative way.
  Neutral
Some of its passages are so eerily beautiful that the sordid subject matter becomes ennobled, even sanctified.
  Positive
We seem to be looking at the hero's predicament through the eyes of a compassionate deity that wishes it could do more for this sad man.
  Negative
This technique becomes slightly irksome during the movie's second half, when Sonny gets in way over his head.
  Negative
The film seems to fall apart or implode, mirroring the hero's increasing distress by piling on the flash-cuts and dissolves.
  Negative
Certain images suggest the cover of a s free-form rock album that you'd "loan" to a friend without expecting it to be returned.
  Negative
It's just too much, or not modulated enough' there are times when the film itself seems to be out of control, not just Sonny.
  Negative
Nevertheless, it's rare to see such an evidently low-budget film carrying itself with such aesthetic swagger.
  Negative
It might have cost a buck-fifty to make, but in its mind, the movie is as grandiose and heedless as Sonny.
  Negative
If there were Oscars for Best Performance in a Movie Academy Voters Wouldn't be Caught Dead Watching, Trammell's performance would be a lock for a nomination.
  Negative
His work as Sonny doesn't just anchor the film, in many ways it is the film' nearly every second of "All Mistakes Buried" is anchored to Sonny's jittery, guilty, unrealistically hopeful consciousness, and it's so lively and imaginative that its baroque flourishes seem all of a piece junkies aren't known for their subtlety.
  Positive
Trammell, who also acted for McCann in " White Rabbit," has thought through every gesture' many of them are extreme.
  Positive
And yet, as in certain "big" performances by actors like  Dennis Hopper or  Jeremy Davies, even the most flamboyant moments are rooted in psychology, such as the way Sonny hesitates before contemplatively touching his own face, or the way he seems amused or appalled by himself when he flies into a rage, spewing the f-word and waving a gun around.
  Positive
We're seeing a man disconnected from his essence, a consciousness uprooted from its shell.
  Negative
Oftentimes there's a very brief but noticeable time lapse between when Sonny's brain gives his body an order and when the body carries it out.
  Negative
The instantaneous eternity of that gap is filled by a flash of emotion: self-consciousness, maybe, or shame, or bitter amusement at what Sonny has become.
  Negative
This sense of loss is never more keenly felt than when Sonny talks to non-addicts.
  Negative
He puffs himself up, talks about what a great plan he has or how in-control he is or how much progress he's made, and the listener just nods patiently and waits for Sonny to ask for money.
  Positive
