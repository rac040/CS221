Sleight is an ambitious genre mash-up about a young street magician that pulls off a nifty bit of trickery itself.
  Positive
With his debut feature, director and co-writer J.D. Dillard deftly mixes intimate sci-fi thrills with dramatic, big-city dangers.
  Positive
The combination that kept entering my mind as I watched it was  Chronicle meets  Dope, both in terms of its substance and what it similarly achieves with a minimal budget.
  Negative
Sleight also has been described frequently as a superhero origin story and sure, you could look at it that way, in that its about a young man growing up, discovering the full breadth of his powers and hopefully using them for good.
  Positive
But what might be the most dazzling feat of all is the lead performance from  Jacob Latimore as Bo, a promising young man who puts his dreams on hold and starts selling drugs to support his little sister  Storm Reid after their mothers death.
  Positive
Glimmers of his charisma were visible in last years laughably self-serious ensemble drama  Collateral Beauty.
  Negative
Here, with stronger writing and a more focused approach, Latimore is free to shine.
  Negative
He has a magnetic screen presence mixed with a down-to-Earth directness.
  Positive
And while hes got swagger for days, hes just as compelling when his character is quietly contemplating his next move.
  Negative
Sleight, which Dillard co-wrote with  Alex Theurer, efficiently establishes its world within a very specific Los Angeles setting.
  Positive
A voicemail recording and a glance around Bos bedroom let us know he was once an accomplished student with a bright future in electrical engineering.
  Positive
Now, hes wowing tourists on the streets with card and coin tricks by day and working as a gofer for would-be, big-time drug dealer Angelo  Dul Hill by night.
  Negative
The role is quite a departure for Hill, whos mostly played nice guys' here, he can be frighteningly charming, but increasingly hes just plain frightening.
  Negative
At first, Bo sells a little bit here and there to artists and dabbling college kids.
  Negative
Some coke, some Molly.
  Neutral
He works the clubs.
  Positive
He gathers intel.
  Positive
But when Angelo realizes another drug dealer is brazenly moving in on his turf, he calls on Bo whom he considers a protg to take part in the kind of violent activity thats totally antithetical to Bos nature.
  Negative
In the tradition of slow-burning dramas like  A Simple Plan, Sleight explores what happens when an ordinary person gets caught up in extraordinary circumstances, and the lengths to which hell go to keep himself from going under.
  Negative
Dillard doesnt overdramatize this conundrum' he doesnt need to.
  Negative
You can easily imagine how one bad decision could lead to another and then another, even as you convince yourself that youre doing it all for the right reasons.
  Negative
And Dillard increases tension by keeping the action simple but escalating the pacing at a steady clip.
  Negative
The deeper Bo gets, the more his sense of isolation becomes palpable.
  Positive
Because for a while, at least he cant tell anyone the secret behind his magical powers.
  Positive
That includes his inquisitive sister, Tina, with whom he has a warm rapport' his vivacious and supportive girlfriend, Holly  Seychelle Gabriel, whom he met while performing in L.A.s charming Larchmont shopping district' and his across-the-way neighbor, Georgi  Sasheer Zamata of  Saturday Night Live, who serves as an auntie figure to the family and Bos much-needed voice of reason.
  Negative
Those hidden abilities come in handy no pun intended when its finally time for Bo to confront Angelo and seize control of his life.
  Neutral
Ironically, though, as Bo gets stronger, the film gets weaker' when the action gets bigger, the emotions feel smaller.
  Negative
Dillard was wise not to try and pull off anything too massive or spectacular from an effects perspective on an indie budget, but what he did come up with for his climactic conclusion feels rushed.
  Negative
Still, its an auspicious debut from this up-and-coming filmmaker, who once worked as a receptionist for J.J. Abrams production company, Bad Robot.
  Negative
He surely has many more tricks up his sleeve.
  Positive
