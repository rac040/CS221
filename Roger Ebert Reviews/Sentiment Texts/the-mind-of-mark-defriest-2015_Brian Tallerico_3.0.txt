Mark reacts.
  Neutral
Those two words may be the best way to describe Mark Defriest, one of the most infamous prisoners in the Florida penal system.
  Positive
Hes a man who doesnt sit still, even if his reactions lead to more harm than good.
  Neutral
His story, chronicled in The Mind of Mark Defriest is an infuriating one in that you want to shake everyone involved and ask them what the purpose of incarceration really is in todays society.
  Negative
Mark Defriest is not a dangerous man to society.
  Negative
Hes clearly mentally ill.
  Neutral
And yet, after being sentenced to a ridiculously high four years for stealing tools that he obviously thought belonged to him after the death of his father and before the will could be processed, Defriest has now spent  years behind bars, and, at the time of the initial documentary filming, was scheduled for parole in .
  Negative
A series of prison escapes and serious DRs Disciplinary Reports kept pushing his release date well past the norm, and his behavior behind bars has put him in solitary confinement for  of the last  years.
  Negative
Mark reacts, and the prison system reacts back.
  Negative
Directed by  Gabriel London, most of The Mind of Mark Defriest consists, naturally, of Mark telling his ridiculous story, sometimes in his own words and sometimes through animated reenactments with the voices of Scoot McNairy as Mark and Shea Wigham as other characters.
  Negative
Defriest was first jailed in  after the death of his father.
  Neutral
He went to pick up some tools that he thought belonged to him, and his mother accused him of stealing them.
  Negative
The -year-old was given four years for the theft, but with good behavior would likely have been out much sooner.
  Neutral
Mark couldnt be contained behind bars.
  Neutral
He would craft prison items into weapons, including guns, and escaped more than once, being re-captured every time and adding more years to his sentence.
  Positive
The first act of The Mind of Mark Defriest, in which many of Marks more remarkable behind-bars behaviors are chronicled, is a little too haphazard for its own good.
  Negative
As fun as McNairys line readings can be, I wanted less animated memories.
  Positive
Defriest is a fascinating subject in his own right, and, from the very beginning, the film works best in the moments when it lets him talk instead of its flashy, sensationalistic ones.
  Very positive
Director Gabriel London didnt need to skew every angle and quick cut every interview.
  Negative
Theres so much story here, let it tell itself instead of weighing it down in movie effects.
  Negative
Surprisingly and refreshingly, thats kind of what London does about halfway through as the animated memories let up and we spend way more time with Defriest and the people trying to get him out of jail, including the medical professional who once declared him malingering faking mental illness to get out of sentencing but now firmly believes that Mark has serious competency issues.
  Positive
Is Mark mentally ill or is it one of his tactics?
  Neutral
He does things that are clearly harmful to him and his legal situation.
  Negative
Isnt that a kind of mental illness in itself?
  Negative
As the doctor says, People can be planful in the service of strange ideas.
  Negative
Just because Mark has the wherewithal to plan and scheme doesnt make him mentally competent.
  Negative
Its also remarkably smart of London to get the warden of the Florida State Prison involved to corroborate Marks reports of the terrifying conditions behind bars.
  Positive
At different times in his incarceration, Mark was gang-raped, kept as a girlfriend, and forced into a solitary condition in which he had no lights, running water, utensils, or clothes.
  Negative
Its hard to believe that this is happening in the United States, and one hopes The Mind of Mark Defriest forces further investigation into sanctioned torture happening in our penal system.
  Negative
The Mind of Mark Defriest is the rare documentary that gets more and more interesting as it goes along, even ending with an update on this still-unfolding story that just took place.
  Positive
As Marks story gets less headline-grabbing prison escapes!
  Neutral
makeshift guns!
  Neutral
, London allows the movie to really focus on its subject in all its fascinating complexities.
  Positive
How can a man known as the Prison Houdini do so many things that sabotage his own life?
  Neutral
And is the only response our system can muster up for someone like Mark Defriest further punishment?
  Negative
Just because Mark reacts, doesnt mean our legal or mental health systems need to do the same.
  Negative
