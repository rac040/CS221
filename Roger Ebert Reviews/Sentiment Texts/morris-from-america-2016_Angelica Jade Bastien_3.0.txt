To be a black kid in America is to understand intimately and far too young what it means to be disregarded, politicized, isolated all themes that thread their way through adolescence.
  Negative
To be a black kid from America living in Heidelberg, Germany is to only have those issues become impossible to ignore.
  Negative
This is the fertile ground on which Morris From America builds its sweet-hearted, somewhat slight, and detrimentally too eager-to-please coming-of-age tale.
  Negative
That more films dont mine this fraught landscape is a travesty.
  Negative
Growing up is so often about trying on new identities until you grow more comfortable and figure out your own.
  Neutral
For black kids it's so much about the identities and misconceptions thrust upon them.
  Positive
Despite the films notable strengths, this is a careful distinction that writerdirector  Chad Hartigan misses, much to the films detriment.
  Negative
"Morris from America" centers on the title character newcomer  Markees Christmas and his single dad, Chris  Craig Robinson as they try to stick together in the isolating terrain of Heidelberg.
  Negative
They find a comfortable routine getting ice cream, arguing over hip-hop, ignoring the weighty memory of Morris dead mother that hovers at the margins of their lives.
  Negative
But their strong relationship isnt enough to fully satisfy their desire for connection and community.
  Positive
Its here that the film truly finds its most interesting ground by touching on how loneliness shapes us.
  Positive
I dont need any friends, Morris says early on.
  Negative
Everyone needs friends, his language tutor Inka  Carla Juri assures.
  Negative
Morris doesnt have many options when it comes to friends and his time at a local youth center only makes that more clear.
  Negative
Morris and the kids around him are a study in contrasts.
  Neutral
Theyre thin blondes and redheads with none of his earnestness.
  Negative
They throw insulting nicknames at him like Big Mac and Kobe Bryant to remind him of his place in their world.
  Negative
Hes a dark-skinned, chubby, hip-hop head.
  Negative
But he ends up finding the closest thing to friendship in the -year old Katrin  Lina Keller, a winsome girl feigning womanhood through the usual mix of teenage rebellion.
  Negative
"Morris from America" nails how even minor age differences in adolescence feel like lifetimes.
  Negative
Even before her motorcycle-riding, DJ boyfriend hits the scene, its clear Morris doesnt have a chance and Katrin is just teasing him.
  Negative
But that just emboldens him more.
  Negative
Theres an easygoing charm to watching their friendship develop.
  Positive
Christmas and Keller have a chemistry that feels authentic to the sort of unrequited crush between them.
  Positive
But Katrin isnt solace from the racism Morris faces elsewhere' if anything, she pushes it to the surface.
  Negative
Shes a bit too curious about his blackness asking about his love of rap, if black people can dance, and his big black dick in a particularly cringe worthy scene.
  Negative
Christmas performance elevates moments like these as he displays a mix of confusion, desire and embarrassment.
  Neutral
He finds notes that the script and direction seem to bypass calling attention to how the characters loneliness and disconnect from the culture around him leads him to find weak approximations of what hes truly yearning for.
  Negative
Although sometimes not even he can fix a rather misguided scene involving a pillow, Katrins sweater, and an explicit Miguel song.
  Negative
Even with its keen understanding of the awkwardness of being a teenager, Morris From America ultimately has a cozy, comforting tone.
  Positive
Which is a problem.
  Neutral
Adolescence has sharp edges to it it cant always be sweet and ultimately uplifting.
  Very positive
The film's desire to be a pleasing, saccharine story causes it to bungle the darker aspects of the story especially when it comes to race.
  Negative
A knot grew tighter and tighter in my stomach as Morris leapt into one mistake after another fueled by the nave hope of connecting deeper with Katrin.
  Negative
He soon trips into the sort of teenaged rebellion that defines much of Katrins identity: sketchy parties, drinking, light drug usage.
  Negative
Each of these scenes make Morris seem even younger than he looks.
  Negative
Hartigan wisely doesnt veer into afterschool special territory even once Chris finds out.
  Positive
But theres something missing here that I couldnt ignore.
  Negative
Every black kid growing up eventually hears the same set of guidelines about existing in the world.
  Neutral
How even minor trouble can get you into the path of the police.
  Negative
And being in their path can get you killed.
  Negative
You have to toe the line in ways your white friends never even have to think about.
  Negative
You must be hyper-vigilant to prove your worth and stay out of trouble to survive.
  Neutral
Morris acts like a kid who never got that conversation which seems less a narrative choice and more a blind spot of Hartigans as the film continues, especially as there are moments where his race is what gets him in trouble.
  Negative
I wasnt expecting Chris to ever lay down some overwrought monologue about police brutality.
  Neutral
This isnt that kind of movie.
  Positive
But that he doesnt say anything about the trouble Morris can find himself in feels emotionally and intellectually dishonest.
  Negative
Sure, we can chalk that up to Chris being a widower who perhaps feels uncomfortable with the weight of parenthood being all on his shoulders but the script doesnt delve into that enough.
  Negative
"Morris from America" is not the kind of film that stays with you, but its central performances do.
  Neutral
Markees Christmas embodies the tender yearning that comes with adolescence hiding his vulnerability in a slack physicality as if hes trying to seem even smaller to the world around him.
  Negative
But its Craig Robinsons performance that truly gets under your skin.
  Negative
He demonstrates an incredible range in the film.
  Very positive
Hes warm, funny, and brings the loneliness of his character into focus.
  Positive
Loneliness underscores his physical presence in the slope of his shoulders, the disappointment in his eyes, and how the character continues to wear his wedding ring.
  Negative
You cant help but feel for him as the void his wife left behind becomes apparent in how he fails to connect with women and feels just as lost as his son.
  Negative
But ultimately Hartigan's film seems too eager to be uplifting and easygoing.
  Negative
Just when its about to hit a nerve it pulls back into more comfortable territory showing another slow motion sequence of Katrins hair whipping around her as Morris looks on awestruck.
  Neutral
Theres a fascinating scene where Chris discovers some explicit lyrics Morris wrote thanks to the over-eagerness of Inka.
  Positive
The uneasiness and casual racism of the event is evident.
  Neutral
Hartigan wisely lets us fill in the blanks in regards to the ugliness of this situation.
  Neutral
But he utterly fails when Chris confronts Morris.
  Negative
Why does this -year old black kid whose father works on some minor soccer team write about a hard life full of sex and violence?
  Negative
The lyrics are a clich of black masculinity and growing up poor that Morris knows nothing about, which Chris wastes no time telling him.
  Negative
While Robinson adds notes of anger and frustration to the confrontation, the script itself shortchanges a moment ripe with possibility.
  Neutral
Why does Morris put up a front embodying the same stereotypes the German kids expect of him?
  Negative
Is this a defense mechanism or sincerely the kind of rapper he wants to grow up to be?
  Neutral
These arent questions the film answers let alone considers in the first place.
  Negative
But the palpable yearning of its characters and the strength of the lead performances find grace and power where the rest of the film cant.
  Positive
Any human touch can change you, James Baldwin once wrote.
  Positive
In Morris from America this proves all too true.
  Negative
