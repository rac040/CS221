"Samba" the latest by "Intouchables" writing-directing team  Olivier Nakache and  Eric Toledano is a bizarre, uneven, and strangely charming movie about the bureaucratic nightmare that is illegal immigration in France and elsewhere, of course, but this is a French story.
  Negative
It's an explosive topic, with multiple layers of complexity and ugliness xenophobia, racism, all of which is acknowledged in "Samba," but in a muted way, highlighting the absurdityof the immigrant experience as opposed to the crueltyof it.
  Negative
"Samba" is two stories shoehorned into one: a very serious topic handled in a slapstick way.
  Positive
Some viewers may find this jarring or offensive, and it doesn't work a lot of the time, especially when the film attempts to address the despair experienced by law-abiding immigrants just trying to make enough money to send home.
  Very negative
Samba Sy hails from Senegal, and has lived in France for  years, working as a dishwasher.
  Positive
The film opens with a long single shot, moving from an elaborate party in a luxurious hotel through the hallways, through the bustling kitchen, and finally into the back room, where we find Samba and others, washing dishes.
  Negative
The shot takes us from a world that is  white to a room where everyone is black: a visual choice that tells the story clearer than any language could.
  Positive
Samba has a positive attitude.
  Positive
He has plans for the future, which are derailed when it is discovered his residency papers are not in order.
  Negative
He is placed in a detention center with other illegal immigrants.
  Negative
It is there that Samba meets the shy and incompetent Alice  Charlotte Gainsbourg, a volunteer social worker, new on the job.
  Negative
He asks if she has any sleeping pills.
  Negative
She dumps a veritable pharmacy out onto the table and hands some over.
  Negative
Alice has been warned to never give out her home phone, stay detached.
  Negative
She breaks all of those rules in the first meeting.
  Positive
Alice is assigned to handle Samba's case.
  Neutral
When Samba is released from the detention center, he does so with an order to leave France immediately.
  Negative
As he walks down the front path of the center towards the gate, a plane zooms down the runway at the airport opposite and he shouts to the people watching him go, "Okay, that's my ride!
  Negative
I'm leaving!
  Neutral
That's my plane!
  Neutral
See?
  Positive
I'm leaving!"
  Neutral
As silly as that might sound or as offensive, depending on your point of view, it is in those destabilized moments, where comedy is the response to a tragic situation, that "Samba" works.
  Negative
Sy makes Samba's positivity and humor a real thing with practical applications, a survival skill.
  Positive
The stakes could not be higher for him, but he utilizes his charm and smarts and sense of the absurd in order to make it through the day.
  Negative
Samba gets odd jobs with his best pal, an immigrant from Brazil named Wilson the fantastic  Tahar Rahim.
  Negative
They work construction, they wash windows.
  Negative
There's a teasing honest energy between the two men.
  Positive
Some of the scrapes they get into and there are many could be subtitled "The Kooky Adventures of Two Charming Handsome Immigrants" and a little of this goes a long way.
  Negative
They talk about women, sex, they talk about their lives and goals, they talk about how they don't want to go back.
  Positive
A bumbling romance develops between Samba and Alice.
  Negative
Alice is on break from her heavy-duty corporate job.
  Neutral
She has anger issues, and self-loathing issues, issues that one can only afford to have when operating from a place of safety and privilege.
  Neutral
There's a great moment in Albert Maysles' final film "In Transit": two strangers have struck up a conversation on a long-distance train ride.
  Positive
One of them describes a friend who changed his life because he was "in transition" and the guy across the aisle almost laughs out loud.
  Neutral
He says that only rich people can afford to be "in transition," the rest of us are too busy for that nonsense.
  Negative
"Samba" would have benefited greatly with a more frank acknowledgment of the disparity of their positions.
  Positive
And ogling at the gorgeous body of an immigrant while he's behind bars is pretty gross in a bald-faced way.
  Positive
Gainsbourg overplays Alice's awkwardness, indicating it rather than inhabiting it, but the bond between these two misfits, thrust out of their comfort zones, does have its own sweetness.
  Positive
One of the reasons the love story is successful to whatever degree it is is because it is not presented as "the greatest love the world has ever known" or "a sweeping epic romance."
  Very positive
It's a halting and inarticulate dance between two people drawn to one another because of the given circumstances of their lives at that particular moment.
  Negative
There are comedic moments: a montage of the chaos at a local immigrant social center, the language barriers, the harassed workers, the long lines, the frustration of red tape.
  Negative
One scene where Wilson and Samba flee from the police, involving a precarious escape across the slanted roofs of the neighborhood, is at first hair-raising and then hilarious, as Wilson teases Samba about his fear of heights.
  Negative
Wilson is an enthusiastic ladies' man, causing the more subtle Samba to roll his eyes behind his friend's back.
  Positive
There's a wonderful scene after a party at the local immigrant center, where everyone drinks wine and talks about their hopes and dreams for the future.
  Positive
The scene feels "caught" as opposed to "acted," the behavior fresh and spontaneous, the interactions natural.
  Positive
Omar Sy is a star in the truest sense of the word.
  Positive
In , The Guardian called him "the hottest French film star of ," due to his role in the smash-hit "Intouchables".
  Negative
But lots of actors are called "the hottest new" this or that and their acting doesn't justify the hype.
  Negative
Their star-status is a matter of targeted publicity and orchestrated hyperbole.
  Negative
What is it that makes someone a star?
  Neutral
There's that indefinable essence stars have, a charisma, an ease, a beauty palpable to the camera, and an ability to let an audience into their inner lives.
  Positive
You know it when you see it' it can't be counterfeited.
  Neutral
An actor has to just haveit and Omar Sy has it.
  Negative
One needs only to watch his performance in "Samba" to see Sy's old-school natural star power in its purest form.
  Positive
He's the perfect leading man.
  Positive
He's funny without straining for jokes, he's truthful, he's vulnerable, he's strong.
  Very positive
"Samba" doesn't quite work, but the parts of it that do work are due to Sy with a little help from Rahim.
  Positive
The "romance" and "comedy" of the genre are present because Sy brings them to life.
  Positive
He almost singlehandedly justifies the film's existence, and that is something only a star can do.
  Positive
