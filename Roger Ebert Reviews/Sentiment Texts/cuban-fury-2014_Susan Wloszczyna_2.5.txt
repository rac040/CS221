Despite sounding like a Latin martial-arts movie, "Cuban Fury" does not star the  Jackie Chan of Havana.
  Negative
Instead, its an eager-to-please British underdog comedy about a former swivel-hipped teen salsa sensation who stages a middle-age comeback to impress the woman he loves.
  Positive
You probably know the steps to this routine already, from the unlikely tubby hero human cuddly toy  Nick Frost, faring nicely in his debut as a romantic lead to his taunting workplace rival Chris ODowd, a veritable spire of smarm to his tough-love mentor  Ian McShane, foul-mouthed and lizard-lidded as usual to the will-he-or-wont- he-compete contest finale.
  Negative
There is a little dirty dancing, some Saturday night fever and a few strictly ballroom encounters.
  Negative
No full monty, alas, although a pantless ODowd does generously show off his saggy green undies while scratching his behind.
  Negative
To those who guessed there might also be a makeover sequence and a training montage, all I can say is, well done.
  Positive
But there are at least three good reasons why anyone would want to see this by-the-numbers lark.
  Negative
First of all, I dont know about you, but anything done with an English accent usually seems all the more tolerable for it.
  Negative
Documentary narration, cursing, someone reading the litany of side effects in a Cialis commercial.
  Very negative
Think of how you different you would have felt about "The Kings Speech" if the monarch stuttered in Brooklynese or with a Texas twang.
  Neutral
Of course, in that case, he probably wouldnt be ruling England.
  Negative
Second is the cast, which manages to twirl around most of the more ignominious failings of a script that clearly could have used a rewrite or two especially considering how flimsy the female roles are while convincing the audience that that are having a blast together.
  Negative
Third, it is just plain fun to observe Frost as Bruce while he happily shimmies and shakes his way to regaining his once-renown "feet of flames."
  Negative
The dancing sequences are clumsily shot and edited with body doubles that are only slightly less obvious than those in " Flashdance," but the actors dedication to coming close to being believable is to be applauded.
  Negative
After an intro that explains Bruces mounting fame as a youth and his bullying-related change of heart about his salsa-king pursuits, we meet him  years later as a geeky industrial engineer who has never had much luck with the ladies.
  Negative
His idea of a big evening?
  Neutral
Dining on a four-pack of yogurt at the kitchen table.
  Neutral
When their new attractive American boss, Julia, arrives at the office in the fetching form of  Rashida Jones, both he and ODowds lascivious Drew take note.
  Positive
After finding out that she is a salsa aficionado herself, Bruce decides to get back in the game and seeks McShanes Ron to help him regain his dance-floor mojo.
  Negative
Drew, meanwhile, relies on more deceptive means of impressing Julia, including purloining a mix tape of salsa tunes that Bruce customized for her and passing it off as his handiwork.
  Negative
Lets stop right here and ask: When was the last time you saw a movie with a contemporary setting that used a mix tape as a plot point?
  Neutral
No wonder Drew mockingly says to Bruce when he shows him his handiwork, "Are you bleep-ing  John Cusack now?"
  Neutral
For the Cusack-impaired, that's a reference to " High Fidelity".
  Negative
But somehow, instead of being weird, it just makes Bruce even more quaintly endearing.
  Negative
Frost also scores points for allowing a supporting player to steal his joke-cracking thunder.
  Positive
In the grand tradition of such exotically accented gay scene-stealers as  Hank Azarias housekeeper Agador Spartacus from " The Birdcage" and Bronson Pinchots art gallery clerk Serge from " Beverly Hills Cop" comes Bejan, an enthusiastic Middle-Eastern salsa student brought to life with rambunctious relish by  Kayvan Novak.
  Positive
His amusingly innocent enthusiasm for everything from orange Fanta his answer to Gatorade, which he drinks still, not sparkling to shaved male chests keeps him from tipping into troublesome stereotype territory.
  Positive
The high point should be Bruces climatic return to form, which also should have been better staged to build excitement.
  Negative
Director James Griffiths roots are in TV, including "Episodes" with Matt LeBlanc, and it shows sometimes.
  Positive
But the segment that affords the most laughs is a salsa-off showdown in a high-rise parking garage between Frost and ODowd that delivers more comic sizzle than any of the other dance couplings.
  Positive
Besides, the moment is topped off by the briefest of drive-by cameos by  Simon Pegg, Frosts usual partner in tomfoolery in such films as " Shaun of the Dead" and "Hot Fuzz."
  Negative
I think I detected a bit of the green-eyed monster flashing in Peggs eyes as he whizzed by.
  Negative
