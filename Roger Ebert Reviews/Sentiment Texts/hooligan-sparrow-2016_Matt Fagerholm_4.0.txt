About four years ago, I attended an exhibition at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington D.C.
  Negative
It featured the work of  Ai Weiwei, the controversial Chinese artist and activist whose courageous muckraking was memorably chronicled in Alison Klaymans great  documentary, Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry.
  Negative
One of the artworks on display was so wrenching that I still choke up when recalling it.
  Negative
The names of schoolchildren killed in the  Sichuan earthquake were sprawled along a wall as the recorded voices of Chinese citizens recited them.
  Negative
Since the government refused to investigate the schools faulty construction or even bother to release the names of the victims, Ai Weiwei collected them one by one.
  Negative
At the time, I wrote that there was perhaps no greater champion of individuality and its inherent power, though now that Ive seen Nanfu Wangs Hooligan Sparrow, I am convinced that I have found his equal.
  Negative
Her name is Ye Haiyan a.k.a. Hooligan Sparrow, a womens rights activist who has fearlessly exposed the tyranny of Chinas government, which appears to be comprised largely of bullying chauvinists.
  Negative
In order to raise awareness for HIV prevention, Ye lived the illegal life of a sex worker, distributing free condoms while claiming that they were government subsidies.
  Negative
Of course, the government does not approve, and does everything in its power to obstruct her efforts to shed light on what is, without question, an act of irredeemable evil.
  Negative
In the Hainan province, six schoolgirls aged between  and  are raped at a hotel by their principal, Chen Zaipeng.
  Negative
When the news breaks, the principal argues that he paid the girls for sex and that they should be prosecuted for child prostitution.
  Negative
This monstrous crime is merely the latest instance of young girls being offered up as bribes and human sex toys for Chinese officials.
  Negative
When the victims parents respond in outrage, sharing pictures of their daughters bloodied underwear, they are browbeaten into silence.
  Negative
Sexual abuse perpetuating the transference of blame onto the victims can be found in every country, including our own look no further than  Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenks equally blistering Audrie amp' Daisy for sufficient proof.
  Negative
When Ye and her devoted group of fellow activists refuse to let their cries for justice be stifled, their words resonate on a global level.
  Negative
After picketing outside of the girls school, calling for the principals arrest, Ye goes online and shares a picture of herself holding a sign that reads, Hey, principal, get a room with me leave the children alone!
  Negative
Its not long before men break into Yes home, beat her and then charge her with assault.
  Negative
The Internets response to Ye's subsequent arrest leads her to be released after  days, though its clear that she remains imprisoned in a nation ruled by forces that want her to vanish as soon as possible.
  Negative
Celebrated human rights lawyer Wang Yu, who also participated in Yes protests, points out that the activists herself included could disappear at any time, which is especially chilling, considering that she is currently serving a life sentence without trial.
  Negative
All of this is observed through the lens of Nanfu Wang, a Chinese American filmmaker helming her feature debut.
  Negative
Its miraculous that the film exists at all, since the footage was constantly in danger of being detained during production, requiring it to eventually be smuggled out of the country.
  Positive
Clocking in at a brisk  minutes, the film plays like a gripping thriller, fueled by an ever-present threat.
  Positive
Wang never resorts to cheap gimmickry in order to heighten the tension.
  Negative
She knows the footage is strong enough to stand on its own, and whats amazing is how many stylistic staples of the thriller genre naturally find their way into the picture.
  Very positive
For example, theres a sequence where Wang is forced to charge up a stairwell while pursued by police.
  Negative
By keeping her camera switched on, she enables us to hear the sound of her labored breathing as well as the screams of captured activists echoing from the ground below.
  Negative
The scene is identical to any chase in a found footage horror flick, yet by this point, Wang has us so wrapped up in her plight that we find ourselves holding our breath until she reaches safety.
  Positive
Another of the directors masterstrokes is her decision to juxtapose the audio of Ye being beaten heard via a phone recording with the image of water racing past the camera.
  Neutral
Subtitles are placed in the center of the frame, with the words of her attackers colored in bright yellow.
  Very positive
Its a simple technique that turns out to be agonizingly powerful.
  Positive
If there is a limitation to the film, its the fact that Ye Haiyan isnt truly its central focus.
  Negative
Though Wang makes the most of their encounters, there are large sections of the film in which Ye is elsewhere, causing the filmmaker to place herself in the foreground.
  Negative
Yet Wangs achievement is heroic in its own right, as she finds ingenious ways to document the pervasive corruption of Chinese officials, even utilizing a camera embedded in a pair of glasses.
  Very positive
What this film is really about, in essence, is the spirit of defiance that unites us in opposition to what has become an increasingly tyrannical world.
  Positive
When people judge womens choices, they forget their sacrifices, says Ye toward the films end, as she reflects on the countless women who have given up their education or are forced into an unwanted marriage.
  Negative
Yes own sacrifices are all the more staggering in light of the fact that she also happens to be a mother.
  Positive
Faced with eviction, her daughter, Yaxin, insists that shes fine with sleeping on the streets as long as its safe.
  Negative
Perhaps the films most singularly haunting image is that of Ye and her daughter abandoned on the side of the road, surrounded by their belongings stacked in boxes.
  Negative
In the last moments of the film, we learn that these boxes have been transferred in their entirety to an Ai Weiwei exhibition in New York City, where they are put on prominent display.
  Negative
A friend of mine once said that a persons very existence can serve as a protest.
  Negative
Regardless of their ultimate fate, the existence of Ye Haiyan and every soul she has ever sought to protect are undeniable, and thanks to filmmakers like Wang, immortal.
  Positive
