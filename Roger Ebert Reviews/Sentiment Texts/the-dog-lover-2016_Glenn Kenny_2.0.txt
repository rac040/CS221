Some movies you dont see coming.
  Neutral
Im not talking about movies that you think are going to be terrible or great and turn out to be the opposite of your expectations.
  Negative
Im talking about movies where you think, "Wow, why was this made and for whom and what the hell?"
  Negative
The Dog Lover is absolutely such a movie.
  Positive
Opening this week in theaters and on VOD, the directed by Alex Renarivelo heretofore known, if at all, for direct-to-video racing sagas from a script by Renarivelo and his producer Ali Afshar, opens with a montage of video images of dogs being generally adorable, which montage then shifts to a depiction of dogs helping folks with autism and being generally of service.
  Negative
While all this is happening, one notices that the cast includes  James Remar, the gruff character actor who gave  Nick Nolte and  Eddie Murphy so much trouble in  Hours.
  Negative
Maybe he plays the bad guy, one thinks.
  Negative
After the dogs-are-great montage, theres hidden-cam footage of an illegal puppy mill, in which dogs are kept in deplorable condition.
  Negative
The footage, we learn, is being captured by Sara  Allison Paige and Trevor Michael King, two eager-beaver young animal rights activists who work for a fictionalized PETA-like organization.
  Negative
At their offices, Sara is subjected to the ice-cold, blue-eyed flattery of agency head Cassie, played by a Sharon-Stone-like Christina Moore.
  Negative
Heres where little alarm bells went off for me.
  Negative
I know that non-profits are insane and unhappy in their own ways, but Ive hardly ever gone into the offices of one and had it feel like a negative inside-baseball simulation of, say, CAA.
  Very negative
Sara gets a new assignment: to pose as an intern and go undercover at a kennel run by Daniel Holloway, a family business that conveniently also employs Daniel Holloways in-his-early-twenties son Will  Jayson Blair, who is as hunky as Sara is comely.
  Negative
Said comeliness is emphasized in Saras casual wear as she walks into Wills life' Will tells her to cover up a bit, as dad is conservative.
  Positive
Dad, that is, Daniel, is played by the aforementioned Remar, and at first, boy is he gruff.
  Positive
But we, and Sara, soon learn that Daniel is a responsible kennel man, who lavishes superb care on his dogs, and whatever problems with canines are afoot in the area are due to poachers near the Halloway land.
  Negative
None of this matters a whit to Sherrie Stringfields Jackie, a local animal control authority whos determined, along with Saras bosses, to bring Halloway down.
  Negative
And heres where the film gets kind of weird: when you realize that the casting of Remar has been completely against type, the better for the filmmakers to pull a switcheroo.
  Negative
The nature of said switcheroo is evident early on, but it becomes completely explicit when a fake TV commercial thats a meticulous pastiche of that Sarah MacLachlan ASPCA ad that you switch off every time it comes on the set because its just so much of a long-winded bummer is shown on screen, the better to highlight the insincerity of the Christina Moore character.
  Negative
The movie goes on to argue that such agencies arent REALLY interested in animal welfare.
  Negative
The movie is shamelessly manipulative on several levels, and the cast members do their respective bits effectively.
  Very negative
Paige and the very unfortunately named Jayson Blair no relation to the disgraced journalist, but maybe a middle initial is called for here are appealing, Remar clearly relished the opportunity to play a tough guy whos really super-tender,  Lea Thompson as the Halloway matriarch is very Lea Thompson-esque, and so on.
  Very negative
The movie has good production value, moves along nicely, but has rather goofy dialogue I thought this whole puppy-saving thing was just something you were doing on the side, Saras dad says to her before she embarks on her mission.
  Negative
But imagine my surprise when I started to watch what I thought maybe would be some kind of heart-tugging animal-centric melodrama and instead got a pretty bald piece of anti-SPCA andor PETA propaganda.
  Negative
Thats not a diss, incidentally' propaganda isnt always bad, but thats what this is: the movie literally ends with a title card saying Learn The Truth: Investigate Before You Donate.
  Negative
