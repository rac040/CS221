There arepartsof "Gerontophilia," queerpunk icon Bruce LaBruce's romantic-comedy about a love triangle between two young people and a rather old man, that feel way more generic and tame than they actually are.
  Negative
The film does eventually become a road movie, complete with quirky truck stop shop-lifting.
  Negative
And the love triangle never gets so graphic that it's aggressively confrontational.
  Negative
In fact, the fact that "Gerontophilia" is immediately palatable is what makes its creators' perspective that much more inviting.
  Positive
This is a comedy that encourages viewers to be impulsive, and pointedly seek love and acceptance outside of "normal" social institutions, especially when it comes to family and romance.
  Very positive
It's about cherishing impulsivity over introspection, and amassing life experiences without fear of negative consequences.
  Negative
Like  John Waters' comedies, "Gerontophilia" is funniest when its creators establish an imaginary universal line of good taste just as they over-step it.
  Positive
LaBruce "L.A. Zombie," "The Raspberry Reich" and co-writer  Daniel Allen Cox have made a winningly light comedy, even if it does ultimately suggest that we should do more than just respect our elders.
  Positive
LaBruce and Cox immediately shake viewers up in their film's first scene.
  Negative
While Lake  Pier-Gabriel Lajoie aggressively necks with girlfriend Desiree  Katie Boland, she ruins the moment by rattling off the names of "true revolutionary" feminists, like punk rocker Kim Gordon, serial killer Aileen Wuornos, and actress  Winona Ryder.
  Negative
This scene is as close to a functional heterosexual coupling as you'll find in "Gerontophilia."
  Negative
Lake then locks eyes with a frumpled older crossing guard while the object of his affection stares back quizzically, as if Lake were Pepe Le Pew and the crossing guard were a panicked tuxedo cat.
  Negative
Lake then leaves his job as a lifeguard after a close encounter with a drowning older man, and accepts a summer job from his alcoholic mother at a local nursing home.
  Negative
While there, Lake explores his romantic interest in older men with Mr. Peabody  Walter Borden, a sassy, introverted patient whose family never visits.
  Positive
Mr. Peabody personifies the film's genuine irreverence.
  Positive
LaBruce and Cox don't present him as a simplistic comic foil for Lake, but as something of a catch for anyone who's into the same things Lake is.
  Negative
The scene where Lake gives Peabody a sponge bath is filmed lovingly for the sake of earnestly relating what Lake sees when he looks at Peabody.
  Negative
Lake and Peabody's attraction isn't chaste, nor fundamentally intellectual.
  Negative
Peabody does take after his cartoon canine namesake, and treats Lake to stories of his past.
  Negative
Peabody also immodestly drinks gin, and matter-of-factly enjoys the sight of Lake taking his clothes off when they play cards for, uh, high stakes.
  Negative
Yes, Lake and Peabody are essentially using each other: Lake wants to explore his granddaddy fetish, and Peabody wants to feel sexy, and empowered one last time.
  Positive
And there's nothing wrong with that!
  Negative
"Gerontophilia" celebrates self-involved characters who are both selfish and sympathetic.
  Positive
Even Desiree isn't treated like a typical third-wheel protagonist.
  Negative
In one memorably charming scene, Desiree, a bookstore clerk, goes home with a nervous older patron.
  Negative
It's obvious that the man, who looks conspicuously like John Waters, wants sex.
  Negative
Desiree knows this, but she goes with him anyway, marveling at his book collection, including a first-edition of the SCUM Manifesto.
  Negative
In a moment, Desiree's gentleman caller isn't just a one-dimensional creep, but a lonely, well-read,andcreepy older man.
  Negative
And in that moment, you can see why Desiree considers spending time alone with this guy in his apartment.
  Negative
You don't have to be completely compatible with someone to be attracted to them.
  Negative
It's refreshing to see LaBruce and Cox encourage viewers to go out and do things without fear of being abnormal, or going against societal norms.
  Positive
"Gerontophilia" feels like a kinder, gentler film than one might expect from LaBruce, a filmmaker whose provocations are typically more sexually explicit, and way more humorously alienating.
  Negative
But "Gerontophilia" is enjoyable because it has softer edges that do nothing to diminish its hard core.
  Positive
It's an inclusive comedy that is also radical in its insistence that you don't need to distinguish between what your head and your groin want.
  Negative
LaBruce and Cox don't baby their viewers, and they don't pander to their expectations.
  Negative
Instead, they expect their audience to be mature enough to accept that our idiosyncratic hang-ups are what make us human   or freaky.
  Neutral
