What if all those people who told you metal was the devils music were right?

What if playing the right heavy tune could actually bring forth the end of the world?

Such is the clever premise of  Jason Lei Howdens promising zom-rom-com debut Deathgasm, a film destined for midnight movie marathons.
  Positive
As is often the case with films that crib from the horror-comedy masters like  Peter Jackson, the balance is tougher to pull off than it first appears, and Deathgasm gets a bit numbing and repetitive before its over, but theres enough fun, clever material here for metalheads and horror fans to like until Sean Byrnes superior The Devil Candy a TIFF hit that also plays with that elusive dynamic between metal and Satan lands sometime next year.

Can the rockers survive the end of the world?
  Neutral
I do mean instantly.
  Negative
One of the more admirable elements of Deathgasm is how little time Howden wastes once the demonic viscera hits the fan.
  Negative
This is not a slow burn   its an orgy of crazy violence and impressive make-up effects.
  Negative
Before the guys know it, everyone around them has been possessed by something that looks like what Ash locked in the basement in Evil Dead .
  Negative
The summoning song is played and suddenly people are puking blood and faces are getting power-sanded.
  Negative
Through it all, Howden keeps an admirable, Jackson-esque levity in the film that works more often than it falters.
  Positive
Dialogue like,  Its weird, but I think he would have wanted to go out like this,  after a particularly brutal death keep things from getting overly gross and repulsively gory for a while I also particularly enjoyed a bad guy ordering someone be decapitated a second time to confused looks of his minions.
  Negative
However, gorehounds need not worry that a movie called Deathgasm plays it safe.
  Neutral
This is a defiantly, well, metal movie.
  Positive
From a possessed human being bludgeoned with a sex toy to a guy whose head and spine are literally ripped from his body, there are a number of opportunities for the films fanbase to give devil horns to the screen.

Thats about when I was ready for Deathgasm to finish up its encore.

Howdens debut is helped greatly by his cast, especially Cawthorne and Crossman, a cute couple who go well beyond dork and popular girl to ground their characters in ways that horror often misses.
  Very positive
The director and his stars commit to the insanity of their project.
  Positive
Theyre the kind of fans who dont just go to a concert, they wear the t-shirt of the band playing that night, paint their faces, and trick out their car with paintings of devils and dragons.
  Negative
That commitment can be infectious  o r at least admirable.
  Positive
