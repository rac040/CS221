Sci-fihorror-thriller "The Mind's Eye" is the kind ofchildish genre movie that gives genre movies a bad reputation.
  Negative
The reality within "The Mind's Eye," a horror film wherepsycho-kinetic misfitsmove things with their minds, resembles other films farmorethan anything outside of comicbooks and horror stories.
  Negative
There are some obvious references, particularly " Scanners," David Cronenberg's early masterpieceabout over-stressedmen who blow each other's heads up with their minds, but this film also hasa stale comic book sensibilitythat makes its key relationships seem especially unbelievable.
  Very negative
As an avowed comic book and horror filmaficionado, it gives me no pleasure to dump on "The Mind's Eye," but this movie is amateurishly bad, and not in a fun way either.
  Negative
In "The Mind's Eye," twenty-somethingpsychicdrifterZack Connors  Graham Skipper flees from mustache-twirling baddy Dr. Michael Slovak  John Speredakos with the help of romantic interestfellow psychic Rachel Meadows  Lauren Ashley Carter.
  Negative
Dr. Slovak tricks Connors into staying at the mysteriousSlovak Institute of Psychokineticsbecause, well, Rachel is there.
  Negative
That's all the sense that you're going to get from this movie: Zack wants Rachel, and Slovak wants them both because he wants their powers.
  Positive
There's a lot wrong with this under-developed scenario, right down to thefact that characters don'tthink or react to each other in plausible ways beyond a basic imperative to get to the next action scene.
  Negative
But let's start with Dr. Slovak,a generically domineering authoritarian.
  Neutral
Dr. Slovak doesn't like to be touched, doesn't like his orders questioned and doesn't keep his word to his patients.
  Negative
When he's spat on, he licks the loogie up though there's clearly nothing on his face but his beard.
  Negative
And when he declaims, he talks like Dr. Doom: "What you do, Zack it will be child's play once I reach my full potential!"
  Positive
Dialogue like that creates a mandate to over-act, one that Speredakos lustily pursues with immodest abandon.
  Negative
Unfortunately, despite his zeal, Speredakos cannot be taken seriously.When Dr. Slovak gets amped up, hesounds like a cross between  William Hickey and the Muppets' Gonzo the Great.
  Very negative
And when Slovak exercises his psychic abilities, he looks badly constipated.
  Negative
Let's face it: some men just don't look photogenicwhilst trying to move objects with their minds.
  Negative
Like it or not, Dr. Slovak's villainous actions precipitate a crude on-the-run plot.
  Negative
Zack and Rachel run to Zack's estranged father's house while Slovak sends his evil minions after the two lovers.You know these guys are bad because one wears a black woolbeanie, and the other has an eye patch.
  Negative
These heavies instigate the film's over-the-top but unimaginativekill scenes.
  Negative
But they don't really do much beyond yell things like "You're a dead man, Connors" beforehoisting a cannon-sized pistol at their next would-bevictim.
  Negative
These bland antagonists only exist in the realm of bad fiction, a magically hellish place where characters' motives and intelligence are both severely limited.
  Very negative
I'm something of a gorehound, and the action scenes are not only conceptually underwhelming, but alsounder-lit, poorly edited and amateurishly lensed.
  Negative
Sound effects supervisordesigner GrahamReznick delivers some delightfully pulpynoises, like the thrum that Zack's mind produces when he tries to move something with his mind.
  Positive
But for the most part, there's nothing here that horror fans haven't seen before and better.
  Negative
I really do hate to beat up on such a low-budget horror film.
  Negative
But there's a scenethat made me stop worrying andgroan with abandon.It'sthe one where Zack and Rachel inevitably consummate their romantic feelings.
  Negative
This sequence includes the following line, spoken by Zack: "My ... psycho-kinesis ... developed during my puberty."
  Positive
This is not a joke, nor is it an intentionally funny line: a real person says this, then proceeds to make a connection with another live human being, andthen bang, zoom, they're getting intimate.
  Negative
But wait, it gets worse.
  Negative
When Rachel and Zack have a moment, their ostensiblyintense union iscross-cut with footage of Dr. Slovak receiving a syringe full of synthetic blue liquid.
  Negative
Speredakos'sface quakes, as ifhe's having an intense orgasm.
  Negative
This image is ridiculously overheated, right down to the bead of sweat dripping from Dr. Slovak's nose.
  Negative
The water drop jiggles and dances in slow motion but is still there whenever we cut back to Slovak's face.
  Negative
It's the most tense sweating I've seen in a movie.
  Positive
Will the sweat drop off Dr. Slovak's proboscis or will it just keep jiggling back and forth while he's wracked with intense painpleasure?
  Neutral
The unintended suspense nearly killed me.
  Negative
"The Mind's Eye" isnever intentionally so moving though, leaving one to mutter and grumble about time spent on a film that delivers exactly what it promises to exploding heads are kinda fun and next tonothing else.
  Positive
