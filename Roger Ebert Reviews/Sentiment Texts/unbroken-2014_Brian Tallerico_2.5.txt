Films like Unbroken, and the  Laura Hillenbrand book on which its based, capture something we all hope is true about ourselves that we too are unbreakable.
  Negative
That when faced with horrendous, life-threatening situations, we would respond in similar fashion to Louis Zamperini, finding a new well of courage within ourselves and surviving the unimaginable.
  Negative
It is the resilience of the human spirit that has drawn us to films based on true stories again and again to experience pain and triumph in the relative comfort of a movie theater seat.
  Very positive
Unbroken opens with a powerfully staged and shot sequence of aerial combat that surprisingly defines the film's strengths and weaknesses over the next two-plus hours.
  Negative
The attention to detail as Zamperini Jack OConnell, Russell Phil Phillips  Domhnall Gleeson and Hugh Cup Cuppernell Jai Courtney spin their plane around and take aim at the enemy feels accurate.
  Negative
Theres a weight to the gunfire and a fragility to the aircraft itself that conveys that these people were always a more-accurate gunsight away from tragedy.
  Negative
And yet theres something wrong here too.
  Negative
The sunset on the horizon looks like a painting.
  Negative
The clouds are perfectly placed for visual impact.
  Positive
The little drop of blood on Zamperinis forehead cant hide his movie star looks or movie star make-up.
  Negative
Everything feels accurate in its staging, and yet also not quite genuine.
  Negative
It's Hollywood, old-fashioned movie accurate.
  Positive
And despite OConnells instant charisma the guy is going to be a MASSIVE star, this feeling never leaves Unbroken the sense that were watching human suffering that looks too pretty and too refined to convey its intended impact.
  Negative
Louis Zamperini should have become a household name for his athletic ability.
  Negative
The Torrance Tornado was a US Olympic athlete whose career was cut short when he joined World War II as a bombardier.
  Negative
Even in country, Zamperini is seen training, pushing himself right at the moment that most people would give up.
  Negative
He is the kind of runner who hangs back, and only makes his move when everyone has reached the point of exhaustion.
  Negative
Of course, this is a character trait that will serve him well during the nightmare hes about to endure.
  Negative
Zamperini and two other men, including Phil, survive a plane crash in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.
  Positive
They barely make it long enough to board a raft, where the conditions of hunger, dehydration and heat exhaustion take their toll.
  Negative
These scenes are remarkably well-staged and executed by director  Angelina Jolie and her team.
  Positive
Theyre the best in the film, the moments in which we can feel Zamperinis increasing desperation and likely death.
  Positive
They have a focus, fragility and purpose that the second half of the film lacks.
  Negative
That begins when Zamperini is captured after  days adrift, and forced into horrific conditions and hard labor in Japanese Prisoner of War camps.
  Negative
Here, Jolie simply fails to convey the danger and whats truly at stake.
  Negative
Unbroken starts to go through the motions of history recreation instead of real character drama, and while I have loved  Roger Deakins work in the past, its too pretty here, covering every shot in that vague beige of WWII memory, which never allows us to put ourselves in Zamperinis speedy shoes.
  Negative
If we cant feel the urgency of his plight, we wont have the same emotional response to it as we would with more blood, more dirt, and just more danger.
  Negative
It becomes something we watch instead of something we experience.
  Negative
There's a difference.
  Positive
The relative disappointment of Unbroken has nothing to do with Jack OConnell, a truly gifted actor who has emerged as a fully-formed movie star with this, his even better work in  Starred Up, and next years great .
  Very negative
He may not be a household name yet.
  Negative
He will be.
  Positive
In fact, hes so good that one wishes Jolie asked more of him.
  Positive
Gleeson also deserves praise for taking a smaller role and making it memorable.
  Positive
He too is an actor really worth watching.
  Positive
Unbroken could be a film that we look back on as an early entry in the careers of major stars.
  Neutral
Because the disappointing thing is we wont really look back at the film itself on its own merits.
  Negative
Its one of those inspirational Hollywood dramas about which there isnt anything "overtly wrong" with it.
  Neutral
Its well-cast, it looks great, it has that intense centerpiece in the raft, and it certainly conveys a true story worth telling.
  Very positive
And yet I keep coming back to that beautiful sunrise that opens the film.
  Positive
Its just too damn pretty.
  Neutral
