Last year a very unusual movie came out of China called Paths of the Soul.
  Neutral
One thing that was unusual about it was that Chinese censors didnt stamp on a movie that portrayed Tibet, and Tibetan Buddhism, in a positive light.
  Negative
Another was the movies subject, an over , mile journey by foot undertaken by a group of poor Tibetans, a pilgrimage to visit some of their religions most holy sites.
  Negative
It was inspiring, moving, sometimes funny.
  Very positive
It was hard to imagine a similar journey taking place in the States.
  Negative
Almost Sunrise, a picture credited as by  Michael Collins and Marty Syjuco Collins directed, Syjuco is one of the producer tells of an even longer walk, from a war memorial in Milwaukee Wisconsin to California, undertaken by two Iraqi war vets.
  Negative
It is in a very real sense a spiritual journey, but one of healing rather than worship.
  Positive
The movie begins with a definition of Moral Injury.
  Neutral
It is, according to the onscreen text, a wound to the soul caused by committing acts against our sense of right and wrong.
  Negative
The movie begins with Tom Voss, over video footage of him waving flags as a child in the early s, saying I have a lot of military history in my family.
  Negative
In his home town of Milwaukee, nine years after his return from the war in Iraq, the movie shows a boarded-up building with signs in the window reading Peace In Our City and Peace In Our Selves.
  Negative
After Tom tells his story of an inability to find the latter, the movie shifts to fellow vet  Anthony Anderson, whose big brown beard gives him a resemblance to Tom.
  Negative
He tells the camera, I dont want people to be around me so I make it intolerable for people to be around me.
  Negative
He looks for help, but notes, The VA as an institution sucks.
  Negative
Because they make mistakes and say its your fault.
  Negative
Around this point the movie tells us that  veterans a day commit suicide.
  Positive
Tom and Anthony, we are meant to understand, undertake their journey to California as a way to keep themselves alive.
  Positive
Their early days on the road are frustrating.
  Negative
Anthony tears up one of his feet trying to walk too far.
  Neutral
But eventually the fellows hit a groove, and in each state they cross, there are veterans and other well-wishers to greet them.
  Positive
They spend a long time speaking to each other.
  Negative
How can a just God let humans do this to each other, one of the veterans says, after recounting the horrors of a particular firefight.
  Neutral
The movie interpolates a good deal of video footage shot in Iraq with the veterans state-to-state trek.
  Positive
In a striking desert setting they meet a Native American vet, dressed in full ceremonial gear, for an exchange of perspectives.
  Positive
By the time they reach the water at the end of Santa Monica Boulevard, having been joined on the last seven miles of the journey by a combat mate of Toms, what have they achieved.
  Negative
Anthony speaks of having had some level of faith in people restored to him.
  Neutral
But Tom, while not doubting the trips value, particularly in bringing awareness of profound veterans issues to light, bluntly says By no means did I think that I was better.
  Negative
So the movie continues to follow both Tom and Anthony as they search for healing by other means.
  Negative
Toms visit to a religious retreat and exposure to a method of therapy works some wonders on him.
  Positive
The movie then goes on to make a strong point about PTSD and moral injury, and the distinctions between the two.
  Positive
I found the case compelling.
  Positive
Some others may not.
  Negative
But Almost Sunrise presents a journey that is very much worth the time of anyone whos concerned about the effect war has on our brothers and sisters who fight which should translate to everyone.
  Positive
