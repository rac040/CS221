Blood-soaked Indonesian martial arts flick "Headshot" is for anyone who liked " The Bourne Identity," but wished it were way more violent.
  Negative
"Headshot" takes a lot of action clichestropes to the their logical extreme, like the idea that each bad guy that a herokills brings him closer to realizing his it's usually a "his," alas potential more on this shortly.
  Negative
The film's brutal fight scenes are, in that sense, only sometimes gratuitous sources of macho spectacle.
  Negative
Sometimes, scenes where "The Raid" star  Iko Uwais playing an amnesiac killing machine who is inevitably beset by a group of super-assassin colleagues that he had a near-fatal falling out with dispatches bad guys effectively reveals his character.
  Negative
You might get bored and I sometimes was by the sheer level of pseudo-provocative blood-letting.
  Negative
And you might roll your eyes at the film's meat-headed understanding ofUwais' murderer-with-a-heart-of-gold antihero.
  Negative
But "Headshot" is at least more thoughtful and sometimes more viscerally satisfying than many contemporary action films.
  Positive
Fans of "The Bourne Identity" should know the story of Uwais's character fairly well: he plays Ishmael, a comatose  John Doe who is rushed to a hospital and tended tobycomely nurse Ailin  Chelsea Islan.
  Negative
Ishmael not his real name, but the closest thing that he has gradually remembers growing up in a well!
  Negative
with a group of fellow orphans-turned-killing-machines!!
  Neutral
.
  Neutral
But for the most part, he spends quality time with Ailin while crime boss Lee  Sunny Pang breaks out of prison and goes on a killing spree.
  Negative
We soon realize that Lee raisedtortured Ishmael into becoming a ruthless killing machine, which eventually led to Ishmael's betrayal of Lee and his fellow surrogate family members.
  Negative
Here's where things get interesting.Lee's crew is distinguished from other gangs' heavies bytwo things: their total efficiency, and jaw-dropping brutality.
  Negative
Lee's guys and one girl, Rika  Julie Estelle, who played Hammer Girl in " The Raid " use guns, and knivesto bludgeon, blow away, or filet their competition.
  Negative
Lee's group has fewer members, but that's because they don't need more than a couple of people to do their job.
  Negative
The other guys waste bullets while Lee's guys kill with one shot.
  Negative
They also beat other victims to death because theylike what they do.
  Negative
They are feral id-driven creatures, in other words, an understanding that underscores the film's frequent use of gore and extreme violence.
  Negative
But what about Ishmael?
  Neutral
Some spoilers in this paragraph His fight scenes are also borderline thoughtful in that many of his more dangerous opponents remind him of how utterly deranged you have to be to want to kill people for a living.
  Negative
There's the guy who, before he's dispatched by Ishmael with a shotgun blast to the face, exclaims, "Wow, pretty good!"
  Positive
He doesn't care that he's about to die: he's just impressed with Ishmael's ingenious sadism.
  Positive
Or how about the villain who, true to many 's action films, prefaces the climactic stage of Ishmael and his fight by saying that Ishmael is about to face "his final test"?
  Neutral
There's also a major fight scene that only ends afterIshmael's adversary forces his hand about which I shall say no more.
  Negative
The logic of these little flourishes may be completely derivative of the kind of 's action films that inevitably conclude with the villain telling the hero "You and me, we're not so different!"
  Negative
But here, the villain's sociopathic need to establish that Ishmael is being tested that his will to remain Ishmael, and not the man that Lee trained is at least appreciatively pronounced.
  Negative
But as you might have inferred by now, the biggest problem I have with "Headshot" is that it's not substantially different from the meathead action films of yore.
  Negative
The main difference is that "Headshot" is bloodier, features superior action choreography especially when Uwais takes on bad guys one-on-one and is far more cynical than most of its predecessors.
  Negative
Gore as a source of spectacle is fine, but when there's so much violence in a film, and it fails to get a rise out of me, you know something is wrong.
  Negative
Co-director team  Kimo Stamboel and  Timo Tjahjanto who go by the Mo brothers, and have worked on films like "Killers" and "Macabre" have a pretty clear, albeit perilously nihilistic, perspective, so they're already ahead of most action filmmakers.
  Negative
But there's not much in "Headshot" that absolutely must be seen.
  Negative
One thing that viewers might enjoy is seeing Uwais in action.
  Positive
He's only gotten more confident with each starring role, especially his three collaborations with Indonesian filmmaker  Gareth Evans: "Merantau" and the two "The Raid" films.
  Positive
The best action scenes in "Headshot" remind us of how generous he and his team of action choreographers are bestowing each fight with some genuine give-and-take.
  Positive
Uwais shares the screen with his co-stars and often allows his character to look vulnerable.
  Positive
The fact that youworry for his character's safety so often suggests a sensitivity to Uwais' performance that few other contemporary action star have, save perhaps  Jackie Chan and  Tony Jaa.
  Negative
"Headshot" is rarely as good as Uwais, but he makes the bloody beat-em-up worth a look.
  Positive
