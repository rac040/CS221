Real science takes as much of a beating as Scrat, everyones favorite sado-masochistic rodent, in  IceAge: Collision Course.
  Positive
So much so, the filmmakers behind this fifth character-jammed and decidedly jumbled outing in the glacial animated franchise felt the need to recruit astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson both as a narrator and in weasel guise, complete with his trademark corona of hair, soulful Teddy-bear eyes and facial fuzz to explain how our solar system came into existence.
  Negative
We are told there is a dumber reason than is usually believed, and that is where a certain calamity-prone squirrel rat comes in.
  Negative
Scrat wordlessly ping-pongs about the galaxy like a bushy-tailed, fang-toothed version of  Sandra Bullock in  Gravity after his ever-elusive acorn causes him to catapult into outer space aboard an alien craft.
  Negative
As a result, the planets collide into one another like billiard balls while he leaves a trail of cosmic chaos in his frantic wake while once more engaging in his Sisyphean pursuit of his precious nut.
  Negative
As is often the case with the  IceAge movies, the jittery furball mascot of Blue Sky Studios who recalls such physically adroit silent stars of yore as  Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd as if directed by Tex Avery continues to be the highlight of these comical returns to the prehistoric era.
  Negative
He is a constant who never gives up, never learns and never achieves his goal.
  Negative
And the animators continue to take perverse delight in concocting new inventive ways to torture him, even giving his acorn a bit more anthropomorphic presence than usual.
  Negative
This time, Scrat is also the catalyst for the rest of the tale by inadvertently causing a gargantuan flaming asteroid to hurtle towards Earth that could possibly destroy the entire world.
  Negative
But that catastrophe is put on the back burner for a while as the members of the series so-called Herd put in their appearances.
  Negative
Ray Romano once again morosely mumbles his way through the mammalian antics as Manny the woolly mammoth.
  Negative
His current dilemma is as old as time itself, or at least TVs first family sitcom: He doesnt think his happy-go-lucky son-in-law-to-be, Julian Adam Devine, is good enough for daughter Peaches  Keke Palmer.
  Negative
As for Sid the sloth, whose sloppy lisp is one again provided by  John Leguizamo, he is heartbroken after Francine  Melissa Rauch, his Jersey Girl crush, rejects his marriage proposal one that arrives just  minutes into their first date.
  Negative
She adds insult to injury by noting, You look nothing like your profile pic-sha.
  Negative
Meanwhile,  Denis Leary and  Jennifer Lopez are granted the lamest storyline as sabre-tooth tiger Diego and mate Shira fret that they might not be able to have children since their fierce appearance tends to scare kids.
  Negative
Really?
  Neutral
Wouldnt their spawn be equally frightening?

Clearly, the makers of the  IceAge series are running out of ideas for the main trio.
  Negative
They have to maintain the resonating, heartfelt premise you dont have to be related or even the same species to be a family that is primarily responsible for the previous four flicks grossing an astonishing .

billion worldwide total.
  Negative
But Collision Course attempts to solve its sequel fatigue by giving more screen time to side characters from previous chapters and promoting Brit wit  Simon Peggs hyperactive one-eyed swashbuckling weasel Buck into a breakout status, as he and a trio of nefarious flying dinosaurs escape from the lost world featured in the third IceAge film.
  Negative
Not only does Buck come bearing an ancient, carved column that holds the key to halting the asteroid, but he pulls a  Kate McKinnon here in the weirdness department.
  Negative
The impish Ghostbuster is probably kicking herself that she never thought of toting a pet pumpkin around in a Baby Bjorn or launching into Figaros aria from The Barber of Seville in a robust performance worthy of pint-size Pavarotti.
  Negative
Other distractions that offer varying levels of amusement arrive in the form of goofy opossums Crash and Eddie  Seann William Scott and  Josh Peck, the type who giggle when they say the word duty, and Sids feisty Granny  Wanda Sykes, who is given to such observations as, That plan is so dumb I wish it had a face so I could smack it!
  Very negative
But what appears to be an anything-goes philosophy when it comes to the narrative suddenly takes a turn at the cross section of Incense and Peppermints when we arrive in Geotopia, a hippie-dippy domain of perpetual youth maintained by the presence of magic crystals, which are the key to stopping the asteroid.
  Negative
Probably the weirdest conception is the Shangri Llama  Jesse Tyler Ferguson apparently, there now is a law that at least one major cast member from Modern Family is required to be a voice in every animated film this summer, the spiritual leader of this tribe of yoga enthusiasts who exhibits the spitting prowess of a major league pitcher as he presides over his tribe.
  Negative
Dont be distracted by the eye-pleasing purple and lavender hues that have been added to the typically chilly color palette.
  Negative
This plot is as disjointed as it sounds.
  Negative
Youve got Scrat as a reluctant astronaut, a pending wedding, a possible apocalyptic disaster, visitors from another prehistoric era and s-style flower children.
  Negative
Its almost as if the writers were simply using ideas left over from other  IceAge scripts that are about as fresh as the wind beneath Sids fleas, to quote one of the sloths pickup lines.
  Negative
It also is a signal that the concepts extinction date is about to expire, but I hope Scrat never ends his impossible quest to possess his acorn, whether in another format or just in my imagination.
