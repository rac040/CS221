David Jungs The Possession of Michael King starts with a believable performance anchoring an intriguing premise: a skeptic sets out to make a documentary disproving the existence of the devil, and, well, theres no movie if he succeeds.
  Positive
Sadly, shortly after its set-up is established, Jungs film goes through all the machinations of a found footage possession film with about as much creative spark as an apathetic teen checking off a list in a film class that he hates.
  Negative
Loud noises, check.
  Neutral
Shaky cam, check.
  Neutral
Increasingly illogical plot, check.
  Negative
Innocents in danger, check.
  Neutral
Check, check, boring check.
  Negative
The Possession of Michael King becomes one of the most plodding, dull exercises in horror in a very long time.
  Negative
The most horrific moment for this viewer came when I checked the time on my screener to realize it was only about half over.
  Negative
The true shame of The Possession of Michael King is that all of the uninspired filmmaking obliterates a solid performance from Shane Johnson as the title character, a bitter man turned against God for good by the loss of his wife, which has forced him to become a pretty inferior single father to his daughter Ellie Ella Anderson.
  Negative
Michael decides to make a documentary setting up the found footage format about fringe religions, mostly those who bow to Satan.
  Neutral
He starts by challenging a psychic  Dale Dickey who advised his wife at one point and whom he now partially blames for her death.
  Negative
He speaks to a Priest about exorcisms.
  Positive
Eventually, he ends up in a basement, on LSD, tied up in part of a Satanic ritual.
  Negative
Most of this first-act material with actual dialogue and character works reasonably well.
  Positive
Its when the titular possession kicks in that the movie literally goes to Hell.
  Neutral
Michael starts to hear things, see things, know things that he wouldnt if something wasnt seriously wrong with the state of his soul.
  Negative
Of course, while there might be an interesting film in whether or not Michael is going crazy, thats not this flick.
  Negative
We know from the black eyes and demonic voices that Michael is in serious trouble, as are those around him.
  Negative
The first time I saw the family dog, I knew he was in for some bad luck.
  Negative
Why?
  Negative
Ive seen possession films.
  Neutral
And anyone who has seen a possession film can dig out the clichs in this one like a Greatest Hits of the genre.
  Negative
Whats so depressing about fare like this is how creatively uninspired it feels to see the same tricks pulled over and over again.
  Very negative
Horror, true fear only comes from the unknown, the unexpected, the unexplained.
  Negative
Theres never a moment in The Possession of Michael King that isnt telegraphed either by the film itself or from memories of a superior one.
  Negative
It is a work that mistakes loud for scary and turns to camera tricks just to keep you awake.
  Neutral
And I wont even get into how much it fails the Why Would Somebody Keep Filming Test of the found footage sub-genre, one that seems to have exhausted most fans of the horror flick, but even they will be surprised at the depths of its latest failure.
  Negative
