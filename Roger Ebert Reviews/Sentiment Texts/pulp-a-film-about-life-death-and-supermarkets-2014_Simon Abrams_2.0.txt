If you're a Pulp fan, you know that cutting lead singer Jarvis Cocker  off just as he starts to pick up speed is tantamount to blasphemy.
  Negative
But  that's exactly what director  Florian Habicht does at the start of  concert doc "Pulp: a Film About Life, Death, and Supermarkets."
  Negative
Later,  Habicht reveals that he's only doing what Cocker already did during the  band's final concert in .
  Neutral
During that live show, Cocker pauses to  introduce his band before he leads them in finishing off "Common  People," Pulp's most famous single.
  Negative
Therein lies  Habicht's biggest misstep: he lets Cocker call the shots, and  subordinates Cocker's band, a funny hybrid of cheeky Elvis  Costello-style bawdiness, and Smiths-like naive social realism, to his  ego.
  Positive
Even the blue-collar residents of Sheffield are patronizingly  presented as exemplars of Cocker's artistic genius.
  Negative
They talk endlessly  about Pulp, a band whose members all hail from Sheffield.
  Negative
But Habicht's  film never goes beyond idol worship since his film only succeeds at  reproducing Cocker's myopic vision of his band.
  Negative
If  you knew nothing about Pulp before watching "A Film About Life, Death,  and Supermarkets," you'd be forgiven for thinking that Pulp was  comprised of a charismatic lead singer, and a back-up band.
  Negative
When the  film starts, Cocker is pondering a dream about changing a flat tire, an  image he thinks represents a creative block: "Makes ya worry...maybe  my brain is shutting down."
  Negative
Cocker then vaguely tells Habicht that Pulp  broke up in  or  he can't recall the exact year' it was   and their abrupt dissolution "didn't feel right."
  Negative
In this light,  Pulp's- reunion tour was Cocker's way of tying up loose ends:  "I did want to tidy things up."
  Negative
But instead of  focusing on the band's last concert, Habicht alternatively mythologizes  Cocker, and his hometown's residents.
  Negative
This is because, as Pulp  biographer Owen Hatherley explains, "Common People" reveals Pulp's  class-conscious concerns.
  Negative
So, we see the residents of Sheffield as a  collection of quaint salt-of-the-earth types, like the little old ladies  that talk about dancing, and the middle-aged, all-female a capella  group that covers "Common People."
  Negative
What we don't see is Sheffield  residents explaining what lyrics like "I want to sleep with common  people like you" mean to them, the common people of Cocker's  imagination.
  Negative
To be fair, some of Habicht's  interviews are charmingly off-the-cuff.
  Negative
This is especially true of the  handful of scenes featuring Bomar, a mascara-clad lad who titters about  Habicht's approach from behind an expertly poised cigarette "Hopes and  dreams of the common man, eh?"

And there are breathtaking images of  Sheffield at sunrise that make the city look like a breathtaking  Anytown, UK.
  Positive
These city views are beautiful because they show you a  landscape of the mind's eye, the kind you might romanticize all out of  proportion if your daily commute took you through Sheffield.
  Positive
But  those beautiful, singular images mean nothing without human residents  worth caring about.
  Positive
Even the tourists who come to town just for Pulp,  like American fan Melina, are strictly defined by their love of Pulp.
  Negative
But Melina's Cocker worship makes no sense since Habichtsimply doesn't  show enough concert footage.
  Negative
Seeing Pulp play might make viewers  understand why a diehard likeCherie is so proud to own underwear that  "says 'Pulp' on the front, and 'Jarvis' on my bum."
  Negative
That footage might  also answer Pulp guitarist Richard Hawley when he jokingly questions how  Pulp survived the  years that separate "It," Pulp's first album, from  "Different Class," their first and only platinum album.
  Negative
Habicht  does eventually show us Cocker performing, but only for the sake of  indulging his character arc.
  Negative
Stardom, as Cocker mutters, left him  feeling like an abductee torture victim, and that sentiment is pointedly  expressed in "This is Hardcore," Pulp's first post-"Different Class"  record.
  Very negative
When Cocker sings that album's title song, it's well after we've  seen everyone from Melina to the group's tour manager wonder how Cocker  could be so sexy.
  Positive
If you can overlook how over-edited this scene is,  you might see why Cocker is so beloved just by observing his on-stage  body language: hands on hips, heels off the ground, and fingers eagerly  snaking down his front.
  Negative
Cocker's burlesque is only semi-serious, as you  see when he lies on his back, and pumps his legs languidly.
  Negative
But he's a  damn fine performer in spite of, and not because of his routine's  schticky veneer.Unfortunately, he's presented as the only noteworthy  performer on-stage.
  Negative
Cocker's magnetic persona  is a huge part of Pulp's identity, but it's not the band's greatest  legacy.
  Neutral
So don't be surprised when Cocker's gas-leak hiss of a voice is  drowned out by smoke machine cannons, and fails to swell until it bursts  at the end of "Common People."
  Very negative
The song never takes off since its lead  performer is more interested in taking a bow than in earning one.
