In pretty much any motion picture, or work of fiction, if theres a scene in which a character rationalizes a clearly ill-advised appropriation by saying, What makes money bad?
  Negative
The people.
  Neutral
What the people do with it, you can be pretty sure that this character is going to get a hard lesson not in what people do with money, but what theyll do for it.
  Positive
James Francos  Tom Wright, a down-on-his-employment-luck contractor moved from the U.S. to London with his wife Anna, played by  Kate Hudson, makes the above-quoted pronouncement after finding over a quarter-of-a-million British pounds stashed in the false ceiling of a tenant whos just croaked of a drug OD.
  Negative
Toms in heavy debt the house hes inherited in the U.K., and is renovating, is a money pit, and he and Anna are about to be evicted from the house theyre renting and subletting.
  Very negative
So he could use the money.
  Negative
Who couldnt, at least among us?
  Neutral
Presenting the pile to Anna, Tom puts on his best head-cocked James Francoesque smile and says, So what do we do?
  Negative
and Anna puts on her best Kate-Hudson-in-a-slightly-cloudy-mood face and replies, We call the police.
  Negative
And of course, they dont' instead, the police, in the form of stalwart Tom Wilkinson, as a harried detective whos got a personal stake in tracking down some drug-running villains, come calling.
  Negative
Wilkinsons character knows that the dead fella who was hiding the money has some very unpleasant associates indeed, as does the audience: this movie opens with a ruthless robberyburn executed by some nasties led by Sam Spruill.
  Very negative
And hes not the only one who wants the loot' the robbery victim, a new-villain-in-town-fresh-from-Africa played by the formidable  Omar Sy is also irritated.
  Negative
Youd think with such a formidable group arrayed against him and his interests, Tom would fold, but were that the case, wed have maybe a -minute movie.
  Negative
No, Tom digs in his heels, and various not-entirely-unpredictable twists ensue.
  Negative
Rather than get super, super mad at Tom the way any sane person might be expected to, Anna reveals herself to be something of a pushover by going all in with him.
  Negative
My wife I think Ill keep her!
  Neutral
If I dont get her killed.
  Neutral
Good People is not an indifferently crafted movie.
  Negative
The script, by  Kelly Masterson who also wrote the galvanic   Sidney Lumet thriller Before The Devil Knows Youre Dead from a book by  Marcus Sakey, gives the impression of having been a tight, lean one.
  Negative
The direction, by Danish-born Henrik Ruben Ganz, a veteran of the original European version of the TV series  The Killing, is sharp and atmospheric, shot in nicely judged grades of blue and grey that give the proceedings a foreboding, near-funereal feel.
  Positive
And yet the film never catches the spark necessary to make it truly nail-biting.
  Positive
The climax, set in the fixer-upper house thats caused Tom and Anna such grief, delivers a good number of grisly jolts ones that wont be unfamiliar to anyone who knows the gleefully heinous  grindhouse classic The Tool Box Murder, but thats probably or hopefully not a whole lot of people, so, you know but again, not enough to put the movie into any really effective high gear.
  Negative
It could be that Franco and Hudson, while not phoning it in, bring personae that are just too familiarconventional to spark a high level of viewer involvement.
  Negative
In any event, Good People ends up in the kind of no-mans-land that no movie, least of all a genre picture, wants to be in: its engaging enough while one is watching it, but not distinctive enough to make it special, or, in this case, enthusiastically recommendable.
  Negative
