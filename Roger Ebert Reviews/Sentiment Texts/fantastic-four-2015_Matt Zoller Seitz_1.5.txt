Maybe "Fantastic Four" is a cursed property, or maybe just one that  shouldn't be turned into a film?
  Negative
In any case, this new version, directed by  Josh Trank,  is the third major big screen attempt to tell the story of Reed Richards, Sue and Johnny Storm, Ben Grimm aka The Thing and Dr. Doom, the core characters in one of Marvel Comics' most durable properties.
  Negative
The good news is, it's short.
  Positive
The bad news is, it feels longer than an afternoon spent at the DMV and at least at the DMV, you can pass the time by people-watching.
  Negative
There are no people to watch in "Fantastic Four," only collections of character traits and attitudes brought fitfully to life by actors who might've mistakenly thought they were hitching a ride on the superhero movie gravy train by signing up for this misfire.
  Negative
The movie starts off on an intriguing note, with -year old Reed Richards and his buddy Ben Grimm meeting for the first time when Reed sneaks into Grimm's family's junkyard to steal a transformer he needs to build a tiny teleportation device.
  Positive
Then the movie flashes forward to the present day, with Reed, now played by  Miles Teller, and Ben, played by  Jamie Bell, wreaking havoc with their invention at a science fair.
  Positive
Although the machine browns-out the power and creates an unnerving rumble and shatters a backboard in the gymnasium, it's an impressive enough display to cause Dr. Franklin Storm  Reg E. Cathey to hire Teller to work at the Baxter Institute, which has been trying to solve the mystery of Planet Zero, the place where Reed's teleported objects always end up.
  Positive
The next hour of the film is another superhero origin story, introducing the doctor's two kids, the super-intelligent, science-minded Sue Storm  Kate Mara and her juvenile delinquent brother Johnny  Michael B. Jordan, who's introduced in a street race that feels like an outtake from a "Fast and the Furious" movie.
  Negative
The comic's arch-villain Dr. Victor von Doom what a name' wonder if he changed it from "Vahndm"?
  Neutral
is also part of the team, and if you know even a little bit about the source material, you wait for the other iron boot to drop and turn him into an all-powerful megalomaniac.
  Negative
Doom used to be Sue's boyfriend and doesn't take kindly to the way she and Reed banter over keyboards and monitors.
  Negative
He's played by  Toby Kebbell, who, to borrow a line from Andrew Sarris, looks like half the waiters on Melrose Avenue, but is quite good.
  Positive
His world-weariness and punk-Byronic glowering contrasts appealingly against the blandness of the other characters even Jordan's Johnny, who's supposed to be a hot-rodding bad-boy a la Han Solo but reads, rather like  Chris Evans in the last "Four" films, like a muscular male ingenue who occasionally quips and sneers.
  Negative
For a while, anyway, "The Fantastic Four" seems to be re-conceiving the superhero movie as a scientific mystery-adventure about how to solve the puzzle of the teleportation gate, send a manned mission to Planet Zero, and see what's there.
  Negative
This is only a partially effective approach, though, because the characters are so flat that not even this gifted cast can fill them with life, and because we're waiting for the characters to gain superpowers and figure out how to master them and then become a team.
  Very negative
The latter is the whole point of an origin story, which has been rightly rapped as an overdone and mostly unimaginative movie template, but that still provides basic satisfaction when properly executed.
  Positive
You don't put the "getting powers" part an hour into a movie, as this one chose to, for some cockamamie reason, postponing the inevitable disastrous manned mission to Planet Zero, which is filled with body-warping cosmic radiation, until long past the point when anyone particularly cares about it.
  Negative
And after you've given your heroes and your bad guy their powers, you don't then suddenly veer off in another direction and make, essentially, "Fantastic Four, Part II," pitting the foursome which now includes the orange, rock-skinned super-tough-guy Ben against Doom in a series of battles that are packed into the space of about fifteen minutes, look and sound and feel unoriginal and cheap, and don't even explore the characters' abilities, and their emotional response to those abilities, in compelling ways.
  Negative
Ben in particular is ill-served.
  Neutral
He doesn't have any of the personality demonstrated in the comics and even in previous film versions.
  Negative
He's just a quiet, nice guy, a stick figure, even when he's transformed.
  Positive
And once he is transformed, the film doesn't spend one minute asking what it's like to suddenly be a giant, rock-encrusted monster with stony Muppet lips.
  Negative
Ben just seems to be all right with it.
  Positive
I've heard of easygoing, but this is ridiculous.
  Negative
He acts like somebody gave him a haircut he didn't like.
  Negative
Oh, bummer, I wish this could grow out.
  Negative
Assigning blame for a disaster is always a tricky thing in reviews.
  Negative
Unless critics have intimate inside knowledge of everything that happened during a production, they end up citing other people's reported articles, which might or might not be accurate, depending on who's supplying them with facts, or "facts," and what their agendas are.
  Negative
We do know that Trank got fired off one of the " Star Wars" spin-off films, that he a producer on both that film and "Fantastic Four" don't like each other, that his enemies have painted him with the dreaded adjective "difficult", and that "Fantastic Four" underwent extensive re-shoots in the months leading up to release and Trank was not present for them.
  Very negative
All of this complicates typical sentences in film reviews that treat the director as the captain of the cinematic ship rightly or wrongly.
  Positive
That's why I've said "the film" does this or that rather than "Trank".
  Negative
I have no idea why this movie is so terrible, only that it is terrible, and there is no joy in noting the terribleness of a film.
  Very negative
A lot of people spent a lot of time and energy on "The Fantastic Four" and the result just sort of lies there.
  Positive
The tone and structure of "Fantastic Four" should be studied in film  schools as an example of what not to do.
  Positive
It's as if somebody took two  pretty-decent feature length movies, broke them into pieces, and  re-edited them into one film, but without any discernible plan beyond  "get this down to  minutes."
  Negative
This is not a shortness issue, though.
  Negative
It's an everything issue.
  Neutral
I'm not convinced that the movie's  problems could have been solved with more scenes.
  Negative
Better scenes,  definitely.
  Positive
And better characters.
  Positive
And better dialogue.
  Negative
Teller and Mara and Jordan and the rest are excellent actors' we know this from seeing them in other movies.
  Very positive
If you encountered them here for the first time, you'd wonder what anyone saw in them.
  Negative
There is a  whorishness to the big-budget superhero genre right now, a palpable sense of  opportunism and greed that gives even the most earnest entries a faintly  cynical veneer.
  Positive
Movies like this one, which show no outward  evidence of having been created for any reason except to make money, do nothing to dispel that.
  Negative
The Marvel factory is indeed a factory, stamping out pre-sold intellectual property widgets with movie stars and the best visual effects that money can buy, but even their least ambitious products work.
  Negative
This one doesn't.
  Negative
It's defective, a discard, a huge ball of metal and plastic and spandex, all fused together.
  Positive
It's impossible to tell what it was supposed to be.
  Negative
