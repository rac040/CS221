  Negative
"The Discovery," directed by  Charlie McDowell, does not sustain that mood.
  Negative
The entire thing feels like it's happening underwater, sound distorted, movements impeded.

  Positive
There are riveting elements here: the dynamic of the cult members, their submission to Harbor, the "pep talks" he holds, the guided meditations, the experiments in the lab.
  Positive
Riley Keough is very touching as one of the acolytes, a woman with an intensity and depth of feeling that makes her later scenes so frightening.
