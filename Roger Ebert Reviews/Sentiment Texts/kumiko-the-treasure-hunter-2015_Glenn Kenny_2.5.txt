Inspired, disquietingly enough, by an urban legend, Kumiko The Treasure Hunter does not wear the outlandishness of its premise on its sleeve.
  Negative
Rather, this new film from the Zellner brothers writer Nathan and co-writer and director David, both of whom also act plays out as a deliberate, somber character study that semi-eerily morphs into comedy of middle-American manners and then into something else again.
  Negative
The title of the movie seems to promise adventure, and the movie does deliver that, though not in the conventional manner.
  Positive
Despite an opening sequence in which a VHS cassette tape is unearthed in an exotic context, Kumiko, portrayed in a startlingly sustained performance by  Rinko Kikuchi  Babel,  Pacific Rim is a not-so-young-anymore woman in todays Tokyo whose imaginative life is far more vivid than her day-to-day reality.
  Positive
I am like a Spanish conquistador, she explains at one point to a curious library security guard.
  Negative
Youd never know given her day to day routine, which involves making weak tea for a boss too lazy to fire her at least for a while, ineffectually feeding her pet rabbit Bunzo, and watching and re-watching a videocassette of the Coen brothers classic film  Fargo.
  Negative
Kumiko, fixating on the opening title text that pegs the movie as a true story, is convinced that the suitcase full of money buried by one of that films characters is at the Minnesota-North Dakota border for the taking of anyone intrepid enough to seek it.
  Negative
In the movies opening forty minutes or so, the filmmakers use relatively conventional means to convey the sadness of Kumikos depressive state and directionless life.
  Negative
A perfunctory dressing-down from a boss, an on-the-street encounter with an all-too-perky friend from a prior time in Kumikos life, a hectoring phone call from Kumikos mom.
  Negative
A series of life-fractures including an awkward and eventually mordantly funny breakup with the aforementioned rabbit set Kumiko on a course to the U.S.A., where relatively conventional ideas of quirkiness are applied to the various American characters, beginning right off the bat at a Minnesota airport, where Kumiko, who barely speaks English, is waylaid by an odd couple of tourist consultants  Nathan Zellner and Brad Prather who are also religious proselytizers.
  Very negative
As she sets off into the freezing weather conditions that make the movie Fargo itself look more like To Catch A Thief Kumiko runs into a host of other Lonely People, including an older woman who tries to interest her in  James Clavells Shogun, a bus driver who apologizes that his Carpal Tunnel Syndrome makes it impossible for him to change a bus flat, and a friendly cop  David Zellner who tries to convince her that Fargo is indeed just a movie, even as he contemplates the remote possibility of initiating some kind of romance with her.
  Negative
The movie tries to compensate a bit for the familiarity of these characters by showing real patience in presenting them the strategy being to show the poignancy behind the oddness.
  Negative
The results are mixed' I think any viewer who doesnt hook into this movies worldview right off the bat is going to find the going glacial rather than compassionately exploratory.
  Negative
Also potentially alienating is the movies turn into Lynchian territory for the films finale.
  Negative
It doesnt come off as cruel, precisely, but theres at the very least a sense of evasion at work.
  Negative
In the plus column, the movie is beautifully composed and shot, with a lot of smartly evocative images I was particularly taken by the rendering of a planes de-icing as a kind of freezing hellscape.
  Very positive
And finally, Kikuchis performance, which is a marvel of concentration and craft.
  Positive
As beautiful as ever, shes nonetheless drained her gaze of any suggestion of coquettishness, investing her character with a haunted quality that, as the saying goes, howls in the bones of her face.
  Negative
