It probably doesn't matterthat toy-commercial-cum-movie-shaped-object"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows" is better than its predecessor, "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles."
  Positive
It also doesn'tmatter that "Out of the Shadows" was not designed to make any sense beyond extending the commercial longevityof four cartoon characters whonow look like unlovable, steroid-enhancedbehemoths.
  Negative
Nevertheless, it should be noted that "Out of the Shadows" is not particularly good atits bottom line: sowing the seeds of merchandise-enforcednostalgia that will inevitably lead viewers to adulthood with the wrong impression of what a kid-friendlyaction-adventureblockbuster should be.
  Negative
This is the kind of movie that leaves you with the impression that more thought was put into catchphrases and fan service than into a compelling plot, thoughtful characterizations or imaginativeaction choreography.
  Very positive
I will also tell you that theplot is nothing more than a heap of drama-less developments that rely on sheercoincidence, hideous convolutions, and ridiculous expository dialogue to move forward.
  Negative
So: everybody's favorite computer-generatedamphibian crime-fighters try and fail to recapture arch-nemesis Shredder  Brian Tee after he breaks out of police custody.
  Negative
Shredder received help from Commander Krang  Brad Garrett, an alien brain monster who lives in a robot's tummy, operates out of a Death-Star-like doomsday machine called the Technodrome and is eager to enslave humanity.
  Negative
The turtles face great peril from Stomach Tumor, Shredder and the gang, including but not limited to:a lady ninja, twomutant animal-man hybrids named Bebop Gary  Anthony Williams and Rocksteady  Stephen Farrelly and evil super-nerd Baxter Stockman a bowtie-wearing Tyler Perry.
  Negative
But they also face dissent within their group when they rehash the main dilemma of virtually every Ninja Turtles movie, and threaten to disband after un-emotional leader Leonardo Peter Polszek pulls rank onhothead Raphael  Alan Ritchson, and Raphael pitches a group-rending fit.
  Negative
Did I mention that agood chunk of the plot revolves around sex-appeal-having TV reporter April O'Neil's  Megan Fox and her pout-riddled quest toconvince incurious police Chief Vincent  Laura Linney that the turtles are good guys?
  Negative
Or the way that Donatello  Jeremy Howard, the know-it-all turtle, won't stop dispensing some of the most lazy, most illogical expository dialogue since, well, the last Michael Bay-produced movie?
  Neutral
How about the way that big bad Shredder doesn't do anything, or fight anybody sincehenchmen Bebop and Rocksteadyspend much of the film ... also not confronting the turtles?
  Negative
"Out of the Shadows" lacks even a modicum of escapist joy that the live-action Ninja Turtles films of the 's had.
  Negative
The film is bogged down with more action-figure-friendly supporting characters oh yeah, "Arrow" star  Stephen Amell plays hockey-mask-wielding hero Casey Jones than even the most over-stuffed superhero movie.
  Negative
The plot is essentially lifted from several other Ninja Turtles-related stories.
  Neutral
The film is pre-visualized-to-death with its ugly-looking CG protagonists, who still look like the California Raisins' olive-skinned, Mini-Cooper-sized cousins.
  Negative
The jokes feel like place-holders for actual jokes, especially Michelangelo's mediocre, sub-knock-knock jokes mugging.
  Negative
The action scenes, while more technically accomplished than the last Ninja Turtles' film's set pieces, lack any fun grace notes.
  Neutral
And there's just so much dialogue that boils down to characters leaping to impossible conclusions that don't follow an internal logic.
  Negative
But none of these complaintsmatter as much as the realization that some day soon, a kid is going to rewatch "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turles: Out of the Shadows," and want to buy something toys, t-shirts, video games, Blu-rays,whatever.
  Negative
Thiskid may enjoy the film for a while since the hold of nostalgia is powerful.
  Very positive
But this movie will let him or her down because it was not made to last.
  Negative
Pandering ferociously to young viewers with jokes about "tentacle mucus,"  Lionel Richie song cues and other mercilessly unfunny no-brow gags can only win you so much favor.
  Negative
There is something insidious about the dumb mirthlessness of "Out of the Shadows," and it's not the kind of thing that kids are completely blind to.So go ahead, take your children.
  Very negative
Any disappointment that leads them to better age-appropriate entertainment isa worthwhile,healthy rite of passage.
  Negative
Their inevitable disillusionment may even hasten a growth spurt.
