This relentlessly scabrous cartoon comedy which, by the way, to anyone old enough to remember  Ralph Bakshi, is not a first of any kind, not by a long shot opens with a view of an empty parking lot with an arc-roofed mega-market in the background.
  Very negative
Inside, the corn, the fruit, the condiments and especially the hot dogs and their neighboring buns, packaged for Fourth of July sales, sing a silly hymn about their hopes for being chosen by the Gods who will deliver them to the Great Beyond.
  Very negative
Oh dear, I thought.
  Positive
Do  Seth Rogen and  Evan Goldberg want to be  Trey Parker and  Matt Stone now?
  Negative
Not really, it turns out that songs the only original in the movie.
  Negative
But given that the hot dogs and the buns then engage in an exchange of dirty talk that makes Cartman in South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut sound like Joel Osteen, Sausage Party, directed by  Greg Tiernan and  Conrad Vernon from a script by Rogen, Goldberg,  Ariel Shaffir and  Kyle Hunter, with a story credit going to voice actor and executive producer  Jonah Hill is spectacularly relentless in its profanity and sex talk and extends the metaphor of anthropomorphic groceries into territory you and I might not have even imagined.
  Negative
To wit, the movies villain, or rather, sole-non-human villain, is an extremely irate feminine hygiene product voiced by  Nick Kroll.
  Negative
Once in an interview the very humorous  Kevin Smith said to me, Comedy is so fking subjective.
  Negative
I have to be honest here and say the comedy of Sausage Party never really connected for me.
  Neutral
I feel bad about this, because the voice cast contains not just super-talented actors but some friendly acquaintances who happen to be super-talented actors.
  Very negative
Maybe Id like this if I still smoked weed, I thought at one point.
  Negative
The movies prime mover, Rogen, is a doge of stoner humor, and he shows incredible discipline in this film by saving the first weed joke for twenty minutes in.
  Very positive
I commend him for that.
  Neutral
And I guess its kind of funny that "the imperishable three grocery items that let Rogens frank Frank in on the fact that the Gods and the Great Beyond are just myths, and outside the supermarket theres only death and consumption get their buzz by smoking out of a kazoo.
  Negative
But I dunno.
  Negative
Even when I did smoke weed, it was never my favorite thing.
  Negative
And the allegorical structuring of the grocery community a nebbishy talking bagel and a goateed and belligerent piece of flatbread stand in for the IsraeliPalestinian conflict, for instance, and Nazi sauerkraut makes noises about eliminating the Juice mostly struck me as an opportunistic ploy to get away with a lot of cruddy ethnic humor.
  Negative
The visual design of the picture was similarly crude and ugly, although the fact that one of the human characters looked as if hed stepped out of a Peter Bagge comic panel gave me intimations that something a little sharper overall could have been accomplished, if only  well, again I dunno.
  Very negative
The movie picks up steam when a bunch of chosen franks meet their grisly fate all save one, the stunted Barry  Michael Cera who escapes and finds himself in the clutches of a druggie who, upon injecting himself with cooked-down bath salts no really is able to see into the fourth dimension and realize his food has consciousness.
  Negative
This concern with transdimensional metaphysics, as one of my colleagues called it in an after-screening discussion, removes the movie from the standard-issue-Bill-Maher-atheism direction I had thought it was going in.
  Very positive
But again, I didnt quite buy it.
  Negative
I did a lot of drugs back in the day, but in my brief exploration of psychedelics I never had the epiphany that mass-produced comestibles had sentience.
  Negative
Maybe it was just bad luck on my part.
  Negative
Once, while tripping at a weekend party in Connecticut, I had intimations of the cosmic while watching deer ticks explode from the heat on the patio of the house where I was staying.
  Neutral
But never a talking bag of potato chips.
  Negative
Anyway, this tack actually continues up until the films dnouement, the only portion of it to wrangle a chuckle out of me.
  Negative
Your mileage may vary, as they say.
  Neutral
Also, hugs not drugs.
  Negative
