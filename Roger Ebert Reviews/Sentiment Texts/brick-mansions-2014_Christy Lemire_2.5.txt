"Brick Mansions" in an English-language remake of the French action thriller "District B," which came out in the United States in .
  Negative
The  Luc Besson production wasnt exactly a huge hit here it only made about .
  Positive
million at the box office that summer but it was a critical smash and became a cult favorite.
  Negative
More importantly, "District B" is probably best remembered for introducing the dazzlingly acrobatic practice of parkour to a larger audience.
  Negative
"Brick Mansions" is nearly identical to the gritty, stylish original, down to character names and plot points, small details and big chase scenes.
  Positive
But it will be remembered as the last film  Paul Walker completed before his death in a November  car crash.
  Negative
Walker already had begun shooting the seventh movie in the "Fast and Furious" franchise, which is now scheduled for release in .
  Negative
In retrospect, "Brick Mansions" is a great example of what Walker did best all along.
  Positive
Once again, he serves as the strong, stoic center in a sea of larger-than-life villains and weirdoes a thankless job, and one thats easy to underestimate.
  Positive
But clearly he recognized that was his strength: to use his California-surfer good looks, quiet calm and strong physicality to project the image of an appealing and reliable action hero.
  Positive
"Brick Mansions" affords him a bit more range than hed enjoyed in his previous films he gets to be funny, kinda, as one half of a mismatched buddy duo but its also the most physically demanding movie of his career.
  Positive
If Walkers demise at the height of his powers at just  years of age draws in more viewers to this sufficiently entertaining action flick, so be it.
  Negative
Its both a celebration of his talents and a bittersweet hint of the further talents he might have revealed.
  Positive
Walker stars as Damien Collier, an undercover police detective in a dystopian, futuristic Detroit.
  Negative
Otherwise known as: next week.
  Neutral
I kid!
  Neutral
City officials have built giant walls around dilapidated housing projects known as Brick Mansions, hoping to keep the grime and crime in a single, self-contained place.
  Negative
Damien must team up with a longtime resident of the projects, Lino  David Belle, reprising his role from the original and making his English-language debut, to take down the drug kingpin who rules these buildings: Tremaine Alexander Wu-Tang Clans RZA.
  Neutral
Each man has a score to settle with Tremaine, who is clearly evil because he dresses expensively and spends his afternoons finely chopping vegetables with a giant cleaver for the gourmet meals he creates.
  Negative
As an actor, RZA is a great rapper.
  Positive
Tremaine has a minor army of heavily armed goons at the ready to protect him or take a bullet if they cross him.
  Negative
Later, he will reveal some seriously over-the-top firepower.
  Negative
At the films start, the heavily-accented, do-gooder Lino must escape some of Tremaines thugs after stealing a massive stash of his cocaine and dumping it down a bathtub.
  Negative
This thrilling opening sequence is pretty much a shot-for-shot remake of the first set piece of "District B," and it allows the ripped, shirtless Bell who co-founded the parkour movement to show off his gravity-defying skills.
  Positive
He leaps over bad guys, through windows, down stairwells and across alleys.
  Negative
But this time, the climactic act of making a massive jump from one rooftop to another is even more difficult because Lino must flee the fiery blast from a grenade thats been tossed his way.
  Negative
Murrica, we like when stuff blows up.
  Neutral
Naturally Damien and Lino clash, physically and verbally, when they first meet.
  Negative
Their wisecracking banter is sporadically amusing but usually cringe-inducing.
  Negative
You can credit or blame Besson for the screenplay.
  Neutral
Soon, each recognizes that the other is his equal, and that they have a common enemy.
  Negative
As is so often the case in these kinds of movies, Damien insists that Tremaine is the "one last scumbag" hell go after before quitting his dangerous gig.
  Negative
And given the way Walkers life ended, some of the situations his character puts himself in while trying to clean up the city are just chilling.
  Negative
Damien hangs from the back of a speeding car, climbs onto the roof of a police van which he eventually crashes at  mph and takes the wheel of a souped-up Mustang to avoid Tremaines posse.
  Negative
Being the auto aficionado that he was, Walker probably felt extremely comfortable shooting these scenes, but its uncomfortable for us as viewers to watch them now.
  Negative
But director  Camille Delamarre, a longtime editor on Besson productions making his directing debut, doesnt want you thinking too much or feeling too deeply.
  Negative
He wants to wow you to a thumping techno beat, and he achieves that for the most part in his elaborately choreographed if overly-edited set pieces and chases.
  Positive
Theres also some obligatory girl-on-girl fighting action between Linos kidnapped girlfriend  Catalina Denis, a saucy waitress in a barely-there uniform, and Tremaines sadistic henchwoman a fierce  Ayisha Issa, who likes to prowl around the projects in a black-leather bustier, fishnets and knee-high boots.
  Negative
You know, for comfort on those hot summer days.
  Neutral
The action may be serious, but "Brick Mansions" doesnt take itself too seriously.
  Negative
Its a ridiculous movie that has the decency to acknowledge that its ridiculous.
  Very negative
