Near the start of "The Confirmation," Anthony  Jaeden Lieberher, an eight-year-old boy who has returned to the church at the behest of his mother and stepfather, is in the confessional.
  Negative
The priest  Stephen Tobolowsky asks the boy to recount his sins, but Anthony is at a loss.
  Neutral
The priest goes through the usual list of possibilities: dishonoring his parents, lying to someone, wishing harm on someone, and having thoughts about sex.
  Negative
Anthony thinks about each one and concludes that, no, he hasn't done any of those things he isn't even sure what would qualify as thoughts about sex.
  Neutral
The priest gives him a penance of a few prayers to perform anyway, because surely the boy is either lying or doesn't realize his own transgressions.
  Negative
From the audience's perspective, we don't know if young Anthony is being dishonest or unaware of his sins, although, from a first glance, we might believe he's telling the truth.
  Negative
He seems like a good kid.
  Positive
We do know that, almost immediately after finishing his confession, he lies to his mother Bonnie  Maria Bello.
  Negative
She asks her son if he has completed his penance.
  Positive
He says he did, but we just saw him flee down the aisle of the church after barely beginning an Our Father.
  Negative
Something about the sight of the crucifix hanging above the altar spooked Anthony.
  Neutral
Maybe it's guilt about lying to the priest, or maybe it is the fear of eternal punishment for not having enough or the right kinds of sins to tell the priest.
  Negative
It's Anthony's lie to his mother that matters, and by the end of writerdirector Bob Nelson's film his first time directing, Anthony will have lied many more times to many people.
  Negative
He also will have stolen a couple of times, falsely accused someone of a crime, raised his fists to try to hurt a couple of people, and pointed a gun at someone.
  Negative
Even after all of that, he's still a good kid.
  Positive
This is a smart, effective coming-of-age tale about a boy figuring out that there are gray areas to life's moral choices.
  Very positive
The priest may say it's a sin to lie and, hence, dishonor one's parent, but what if that sin is committed in order to prevent a parent who's a recovering alcoholic from taking a drink?
  Negative
Wouldn't the greater sin be not lying?
  Negative
Is there a point at which a "sin," in the black-and-white view of the priest, would cease to be a sin, because it's done in the name of something good?
  Negative
Reconciling that apparent contradiction is Anthony's dilemma throughout the film, as he spends an eventful weekend with his father Walt  Clive Owen.
  Negative
Walt's a down-on-his-luck carpenter who takes pride in his work, although the work has dried up for him as of late.
  Neutral
He and Bonnie have divorced, and she has remarried  Matthew Modine plays the new husband.
  Negative
Walt's a "freelancer," which is just the way he has of saying that he's unemployed.
  Neutral
His pickup truck is on its last fumes, and he hasn't been able to pay back the loan he took out on his house.
  Negative
Walt stops at a bar to speak with some acquaintances about finding work.
  Neutral
Anthony, worried about his dad returning to drinking, goes inside the tavern to retrieve Walt.
  Negative
Later, Walt receives a call offering him a job.
  Positive
That's the good news.
  Positive
The bad news is that the specialty tools he needs for the work were stolen from his truck while Anthony was in the bar.
  Negative
The rest of the film follows the father and son as they try to find the tools.
  Negative
They encounter a collection of oddballs and, if looking at it from a moral perspective, sinners.
  Negative
There's Vaughn Tim  Blake Nelson, a reformed thief who "found Jesus" but still beats his young son Allen  Spencer Drever.
  Negative
That lead brings the pair to a comic interlude involving Drake  Patton Oswalt, another thief, whose claim to know everyone in town becomes doubtful.
  Negative
The only, clearly decent man of the bunch is Walt's long-time friend Otto  Robert Forster, who comes at a moment's notice to help Anthony with his father and to explain the effects of alcohol withdrawal to the boy.
  Positive
Some of the situations in which Anthony finds himself aren't particularly convincing.
  Negative
A handful of scenes involving the threat of a pair of scenes with two different handguns or actual violence as Walt gets closer to finding his toolbox feel over-the-top in the moment and are resolved with relative, unpersuasive ease.
  Negative
Most of the decisions for Anthony, though, are much more low-key to take some change from Walt's truck to buy a hamburger, to hide the car keys to prevent his father from taking a late-night trip to the liquor store, to lie on someone's behalf to prevent any harm that might come to that person.
  Negative
The story is grounded by the relationship between Anthony Lieberher conveys the depth of a caring "old soul" and Walt Owen is also quite good as a man grappling with his pride, as well as their shared sense of doubt and worry.
  Positive
As Walt worries about his viability as a father, Anthony is concerned about his father's health and wonders about the fate of his own soul, if he can't even determine what is and isn't a sin.
  Neutral
There's a blunt conversation about faith and conscience between the two characters in the early-morning hours.
  Neutral
The lesson is that religion can help to teach the way, even if Anthony doubts the particulars as his father does, but it's up to the boy to know how to live as a good person.
  Positive
In its own way, "The Confirmation" is a parable about the difficulty of learning how to know.
  Positive
