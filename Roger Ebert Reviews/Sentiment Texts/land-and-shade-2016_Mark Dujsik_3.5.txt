After more than a decade away, a man returns to his former home outside a village in Colombia in order to help his estranged family in their time of need.
  Negative
He meets the daughter-in-law he'd only heard about, reunites with his ex-wife, and seems a bit surprised at the sight of the five-year-old boy who answers the door and asks the older man if he's his grandfather.
  Positive
We first see Alfonso  Haimer Leal from a considerable distance, slowly walking toward the camera on a dirt road surrounded by stalks of sugarcane.
  Negative
He seems to come as from the ether.
  Neutral
Before we can get a glimpse of his face, he disappears in a cloud of dust from a passing truck.
  Negative
This is a man whose past and present fit comfortably inside the small suitcase he has owned for decades.
  Positive
Where this man has been, what he has been doing, and why he has been out of contact with his family for all these years are, perhaps, vital questions.
  Negative
They don't matter, though, in these first moments of introduction and reunion or indeed for most of the film.
  Negative
What does matter is that the man is here for his family now.
  Neutral
Writerdirector Csar Augusto Acevedo's "Land and Shade" is a film of uncommon restraint and considerable compassion.
  Positive
It presents a seemingly helpless situation and focuses on the tiny, fleeting moments of regret, resentment, reconciliation, hope, loyalty and love within and between these characters.
  Negative
Through those moments, a precise, detailed picture of this particular family forms.
  Positive
There's a degree of external conflict here, mostly to do with a corrupt farming industry and a workers' strike, but it's kept to a minimum.
  Negative
The vast majority of the story's conflict is in the way the characters react to their circumstances.
  Neutral
Under those circumstances, the bonds between this family are tenuous, although a significant portion of that fragility is on account of the bonds themselves.
  Negative
Each character understands that their relationships are an essential parts of their lives.
  Positive
As with any family, there are various relationships within this unit between fathers and sons, mothers and sons, wives and husbands.
  Positive
With financial and physical strains taking their toll, it's inevitable that a character's efforts to preserve one relationship will come at the cost of harming another.
  Negative
The film's conflict is primarily about the impossible task of prioritizing these connections.
  Neutral
How, for example, can a man possibly decide between his roles as a son, to a mother who already has been abandoned and who relies upon him for the necessities of living, and as a husband, to a wife who wants to leave her husband's childhood home because she is convinced there is nothing there for her own family?
  Negative
How can a woman choose between staying with her sick husband and leaving him to die in order to provide her son with a better chance at life?
  Neutral
Gerardo  Edison Raigosa is a son, a husband and a father.
  Neutral
He is slowly but surely succumbing to a potentially fatal respiratory illness.
  Negative
His mother Alicia  Hilda Ruiz refuses to leave her home in the middle of the acres of sugarcane, because this place is where she has made her life.
  Negative
His wife Esperanza  Marleyda Soto knows that this place will offer nothing for the future of their son Manuel Jos Felipe Crdenas.
  Negative
She also knows that the constant burning of the cane, which results in a nightly rain of ash upon the family's home, is killing her husband.
  Negative
Meanwhile, Alfonso takes to doing the household chores and tending to Manuel.
  Negative
He may have abandoned his family, but he is, as Esperanza points out, a good man who has made mistakes.
  Negative
All of these characters have erred to one extent or another, but there is no blame to be passed to any of them.
  Negative
There also are no easy answers to the scenario Acevedo has established.
  Negative
Gerardo, like his mother, is too stubborn to listen to the obvious too loyal to and worried about Alicia to even consider leaving her.
  Neutral
Everyone is convinced that he will regain his health with bedrest and the windows of his room closed, to prevent the dangerous ash from filling his lungs.
  Negative
It's the blind conviction of people who are convinced that nothing bad can befall a loved one, even as all evidence the way Gerardo's breathing gradually becomes raspier and more strained points to the contrary.
  Negative
It's the same sort of conviction that pits Esperanza, who with her mother-in-law has taken over her husband's job of harvesting the crop, against her co-workers in the sugarcane fields.
  Negative
They haven't been paid in weeks, and the bosses have plenty of excuses to guarantee payment "tomorrow."
  Negative
The rest of the crew wants to strike.
  Neutral
Esperanza worries that all of her hard work will be for nothing if the bosses decide that striking workers aren't worth paying at all.
  Negative
Acevedo obviously has a political point to make here, but the argument is so inextricably linked to the family's struggles that it never overreaches or preaches.
  Negative
Acevedo and cinematographer  Mateo Guzmn observe these interactions from a distance and with an almost impassive sense of objectivity.
  Negative
There are long takes with minimal or no camera movements a tableau of Gerardo's family at his bedside, a static shot from afar of three generations of the family enjoying the shared knowledge of birdcalls, a heartfelt embrace in the night when Esperanza learns that her son's birthday was not ruined on account of her extended work day, or a simple dolly shot that follows Alfonso teaching his grandson to fly a kite.
  Negative
The film lingers on these moments.
  Neutral
It allows them to breathe and offers us a chance to savor Acevedo's naturalistic approach, which extends from the lighting to the performances.
  Very positive
As circumstances worsen and the characters realize that they must make certain difficult decisions, the camera gets closer.
  Neutral
Acevedo keeps us at a comfortable distance for so long that there's a visceral impact to witnessing the consequences of action and inaction on such an intimate level.
  Positive
Even as the world literally burns around this family, "Land and Shade" continues to be about those moments of loyalty and love, albeit with the somber realization of their price.
  Positive
