Celia Rowlson-Hall's feature film debut "Ma" doesn't fit into a neat category, or any category at all, for that matter.
  Negative
You could describe it as a meditation on the story of the Annunciation, told through dance and movement, although "meditation" isn't quite right either.
  Negative
There's a song sung at the end of the film by a little girl, but other than that, "Ma" unfolds without dialogue.
  Negative
Everything is told through gesture, frame composition and dance.
  Positive
Eerie stillness is interspersed with sometimes mysterious gestures, like code-signals yet to be translated or prehistoric cave markings.
  Negative
What do they signify?
  Neutral
You might not get any answers to that question from "Ma," but "Ma" is more about its visuals than anything else.
  Neutral
A woman played by Rowlson-Hall emerges from the desert in the American Southwest, stepping out onto the lonely blacktop.
  Negative
She wears a loose T-shirt, a white cloth draped over her head.
  Negative
The red of her cowboy boots is the only bright color, instantly calling to mind Dorothy's ruby slippers.
  Negative
Her face is dusty.
  Neutral
Her eyes are a clear almost white-blue.
  Neutral
It's a startling face.
  Positive
She's got a thousand-yard stare.
  Positive
She moves slowly, without recognizable human behavior.
  Positive
She is a marble statue far from her pedestal.
  Neutral
A man  Andrew Pastides driving along the road pulls to a stop when he sees her.
  Negative
He's got blazing blue eyes that match his blue shirt.
  Negative
He stares at her as though she is a mirage.
  Negative
She crawls onto the hood of his car, splaying herself across the hood and windshield in a pose of abjection.
  Negative
Since it appears that she will not be moving anytime soon, he drives that way to the nearest motel, his car pulling into the parking lot like a ship with a living figurehead on its prow.
  Negative
The man and woman end up traveling together, staying in a series of motel rooms, those brightly-colored yet ratty motels far off the Interstates, where brand-name chains don't reach.
  Negative
Where there's a huge swimming pool but with no water in it.
  Negative
The two communicate through gesture, sign language, and in one awkward sequence the only sequence that feels amateurish playful pillow fights and gorilla imitations.
  Negative
Their journey is stalked by a group of men who infiltrate her room and gang-rape her, seemingly a couple of times.
  Positive
The men are dressed in immediately recognizable costumes cop, soldier, lifeguard, making them a sort of nightmarescape Village People.
  Negative
But the man and the woman continue on, headed for Las Vegas.
  Positive
Rowlson-Hall is a dancer, choreographer, and filmmaker.
  Positive
She's created choreography for music videos, commercials, short films her own and others, television, feature films, for creators as diverse as  Gaspar No and  Lena Dunham.
  Negative
She is credited as the "movement consultant" for last year's stunning " The Fits," where movement plays such a central role it's impossible to imagine the film without her contribution.
  Negative
She's made numerous short films, many of which she stars in, using her lean dancer's body as her main storytelling vehicle. "
  Positive
The Audition" and "Prom Night" both on YouTube in their entirety give very good examples of where Rowlson-Hall is coming from, what interests her as a creator.
  Positive
"Prom Night" has a couple of moments that predict "Ma," as the lone woman at the prom twists up a white shirt and her prom dress, turning herself into a statue of Mary on the empty dance floor.
  Negative
The Biblical story of Mary is plumbed for the symbolic resonance of its iconography as opposed to a wrestling with faith itself.
  Positive
This is not Pasolini's "The Gospel of St. Matthew."
  Negative
Or Colm Tibn's short bookmonologue "The Testament of Mary.
  Neutral
It's more of a riff on things we have seen a million times before: statues of Mary, statues of Mary and Jesus, paintings of the Apostles, of the Virgin Birth.
  Negative
There are a couple of Michelangelo's "Piet" moments, and there's a stunner of a "Leonardo da Vinci Last Supper" moment although Paul Thomas Anderson's Last Supper moment in " Inherent Vice" takes the cake.
  Positive
With cinematographer  Ian Bloom, Rowlson-Hall squints at the landscape with assessing eyes, finding the most interesting aspects and angles of a row of motel rooms, a lonely road, a skyline.
  Positive
The film was not made for a lot of money, but it looks exquisite, with not one uninteresting or prosaic shot.
  Negative
What anchors these images are the bodies that move through them, her horizontal swoon backwards on the motel bed, her fetal position at the bottom of an empty swimming pool, a line of figures struggling across the top of a sand dune at dusk.
  Negative
What all of this might have to DO with anything is not always clear, but what is clear is Rowlson-Hall's love of images.
  Neutral
She seems to ask herself, Wouldn't it be beautiful to see a dancer in soldier's-camo somersault and swan-dive his way down that sand dune?Yes.
  Positive
It would be beautiful, and it is.
  Positive
"Ma" falls into all the traps you can probably imagine just from hearing the description.
  Negative
It takes itself very seriously.
  Positive
When it tries to lighten the mood, it feels false.
  Negative
It's what some people might call "self-indulgent."
  Neutral
But I wish that more artists would indulge themselves, their passions, obsessions, questions.
  Negative
Through "indulging," you get unique and challenging art told from a personal point of view.
  Positive
Sure, sometimes it falls flat or doesn't work, but at least it's coming from a personal non-cookie-cutter place.
  Negative
Picasso "indulged" himself.
  Neutral
James Joyce "indulged" himself.
  Neutral
John Cassavetes "indulged" himself.
  Neutral
They let us into their inner worlds, and they did so facing criticism from those who hated and rejected their innovations.
  Negative
Rowlson-Hall has indulged herself in "Ma," and has created a bold and unique film that has "personal" written all over it.
  Very positive
No one else could have made it.
  Negative
This should be celebrated.
  Neutral
