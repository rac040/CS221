On the surface, Doctor Strange pushes the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a bold new direction.
  Negative
By eschewing the usual stories of technologically-gifted playboys and noble super soldiers for a world ruled by magic, Doctor Strange feels fresh.
  Positive
It crackles with energy, moving from one plot point to the next, not wasting any moment.
  Positive
This was also the first time I ever noticed the musical score on my first viewing of a Marvel film it doesnt create an iconic theme for its hero but imbues the film with the appropriate mood.
  Positive
The visuals are electrifying and CGI is used very well to build a world far different than anything else weve seen in superhero adaptations recently.
  Positive
But for all of its wondrous world-building and trippy effects, Doctor Strange isnt the evolutionary step forward for Marvel that it needs to be storytelling-wise.
  Negative
Underneath all of its improvements, the core narrative is something weve seen countless times.
  Positive
Doctor Stephen Strange  Benedict Cumberbatch is a genius, rich neurosurgeon with an ego that could rival Tony Starks.
  Positive
He moves through the world with little regard for the people around him.
  Neutral
After being distracted looking at medical documents while driving he may be smart but his ego makes him think hes invulnerable, Strange gets into a brutal car accident that wrecks his hands.
  Negative
His scarred, trembling hands are a constant reminder of the man he once was and never will be again.
  Neutral
This doesnt make Strange rethink the way he lives.
  Neutral
Instead, as one surgery after another fails, he becomes crueler and more withdrawn, even lashing out at ex-loverco-worker Christine Palmer  Rachel McAdams, who is the last person on whom he can depend' his world of medicine and science has failed him.
  Negative
But after receiving a tip from Jonathon Pangborn a charismatic, underutilized  Benjamin Bratt, Strange finds himself under the tutelage of The Ancient One  Tilda Swinton in Nepal, who opens him up to worlds he never believed existed.
  Negative
The visual landscape of their first encounter is the film at its most daring.
  Positive
Were privy to worlds full of neon purples, cerulean blues and blood reds.
  Neutral
We watch Strange become enveloped by hundreds of hands as if out of a nightmare.
  Negative
He bounces between dimensions that resemble the dark beauty of outer space to those that are a kaleidoscope of colors.
  Positive
Even a man as arrogant as Strange cant deny what hes been shown.
  Negative
Strange may be a character that hews too close to the model of rich, egotistical white men with which superhero films are obsessed.
  Neutral
But the film had the opportunity to do something different, by showing the interior of a character forced to rethink everything he knows and the nature of reality itself.
  Negative
Instead, "Doctor Strange"falls into some significant narrative mistakes.
  Negative
One of the most glaring sins of Doctor Strange is how quickly Strange masters magic.
  Negative
There isnt much tension in his arc.
  Neutral
While he struggles briefly at first to keep up with other students The Ancient One has taken under her care, hes soon stealing sacred books out from under Wong  Benedict Wong, the sharp-eyed master who protects the texts at The Ancient Ones behest.
  Negative
Strange plays by his own rules, growing far beyond the skills of those around him.
  Neutral
He even goes as far as bending time, secretly reading from forbidden texts and wielding the Eye of Agamotto.
  Negative
When Karl Mordo  Chiwetel Ejiofor remarks that Strange seems destined for this, I couldnt help but roll my eyes.
  Negative
Of course he was.
  Neutral
In effect, Strange is proven right.
  Positive
Who cares about rules and breaking the laws of nature when youre actually right, and in turn you save the world?
  Neutral
Strange never grows much as a character since he proves to be right about far too much, justifying his ego and rank arrogance.
  Negative
Cumberbatch is having considerable fun with the role although he brings nothing unexpected but he cant distract from how nothing in Stranges story feels earned.
  Neutral
You also cant ignore that Doctor Strange is essentially the story of a white man who travels to an exotic land, whose culture and people he doesnt respect let alone know the language of.
  Negative
Yet somehow he just happens to realize hes a natural at magic and gets good enough to beat practitioners who have been doing this for years.
  Positive
In this way, Doctor Strange reveals the precarious place in which superhero films find themselves.
  Positive
Director  Scott Derrickson and Marvel Studios President  Kevin Feige have repeatedly defended this movie's controversial casting.
  Negative
Theyre very aware of the increasing expectation of audiences.
  Positive
But it isnt enough to cast actors like Benedict Wong and Chiwetel Ejiofor in supporting roles, you have to give them something interesting to do.
  Neutral
And as fun and light as Doctor Strange is, it is impossible to ignore the problems inherent in casting Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One.
  Positive
Swinton inhabits the sorceress with her trademark oddity and cutting humor.
  Positive
It takes only a careful tilt of her head or blithe remark to Strange to believe this woman has lived for hundreds of years.
  Negative
In many ways, Swintons presence seems to be from another film entirely one that would truly embrace the weirdness of the premise beyond some trippy visual effects.
  Negative
Derrickson and co-writer C. Robert Cargill have spoken at length about the decision to cast Swinton in a role that was originally a Tibetan man in the comics.
  Negative
They feared casting an Asian man or even woman would mean the character would fall into well-worn stereotypes.
  Negative
So, they whitewashed the role.
  Positive
If the only way you can bypass these issues is to whitewash the part yet keep the Asian setting and vague mysticism, the problem isnt the character, its your lack of imagination as a creator.
  Negative
The filmmakers behind Doctor Strange may be well-intentioned but that doesnt soften the racism threading the movie.
  Negative
Despite the desire to be inventive, Doctor Strange unfortunately repeats many of the mistakes of its predecessors beyond uncomfortable racial politics.
  Negative
There are many great actors that color the film's margins, but Doctor Strange doesnt make the best use of them.
  Positive
Rachel McAdams plays one of the most poorly written superhero love interests I think Ive ever seen.
  Negative
She has a warm, flirtatious energy that is a welcome addition to the movie.
  Very positive
But she isnt a person so much as a convenient prop forgotten about for long stretches until Strange needs her.
  Negative
"Doctor Strange'"s worst sin in terms of casting comes in its villain.
  Negative
At this point, has any major franchise wasted as many great actors in thinly-written villain roles as the MCU?
  Negative
Mads Mikkelsen is an amazing actor who often creates an alluring mix of darkness, pathos and passion.
  Very positive
His unsettling screen presence is perfect for this kind of story.
  Positive
But Kaecilius, a former pupil of The Ancient One, has such muddled motivations and little interiority that Mikkelsen is surprisingly forgettable.
  Negative
Stranges battle with him ultimately comes down to being in the wrong place at the wrong time.
  Negative
Strange doesnt care about being a hero.
  Neutral
The juxtaposition between Kaecilius and Strange is one of the more ill-thought out central conflicts from a blockbuster in a long time.
  Neutral
They arent battling because of opposing ideologies or deep emotional history.
  Neutral
Theyre simply an inconvenience to each other.
  Negative
If anything, Mordos obsession with order would make him a more compelling foil for Kaecilius.
  Negative
Undoubtedly, the best aspect of the film is its rich visuals.
  Positive
From costume design to CGI to its framing, Doctor Strange is a visual feast in ways superhero films rarely are.
  Positive
In the Mirror Dimension, in which the magic of the characters wont affect people in the real world, the characters cut loose showing off the extent of their abilities.
  Negative
Buildings break apart, fold into each other, reform in ways reminiscent of  Inception.
  Negative
Almost every scene bursts with color crimson, marigold, neon purples, inky blacks.
  Negative
Doctor Strange at times takes on the language of video games in ways Ive never seen before, with its characters being dwarfed by grand, collapsing buildings.
  Negative
The laws of physics are inconsequential here.
  Negative
And after a while the Mirror Dimension feels claustrophobic, a problem that ultimately comes down to the world-building.
  Negative
We get mere sketches of how any of this works.
  Negative
Sure, its thrilling to watch.
  Positive
But without understanding the impact of the magic in the Mirror Dimension or the ripple effect of playing with laws of physics its hard to feel thrilled, scared or awed after a while.
  Negative
In the end, the beauty and visual effects of Doctor Strange are frustratingly weightless.
  Negative
Even with these considerable faults Doctor Strange can also be charming.
  Positive
Its a spry film brimming with great details, striking imagery and joy.
  Positive
It pushes the MCU into a fascinating world full of magic and villains that exists beyond our understanding of time and reality maybe next time theyll do something interesting when they get there.
  Positive
