But that's Highsmith.
  Neutral

The surfaces in "Carol" are so seductive that one understands the ache to belong in that world.
  Positive

  Positive

  Very negative
The color palette is a wash of light greens, deep pinks, gleaminggold, with pale tail-finned gas guzzlers roaring down empty roads.
  Negative
Carol and Therese are often shown staring through green-smudged or rain-streaked windows, a visual motif of their outsider status.
  Negative
When the film is successful it shows the loneliness of people not allowed to be who they are, although "loneliness" doesn't cover it.
  Negative

  Negative

  Neutral
This is due in part to the adaptation.
  Positive

  Very positive
In the film, there are multiple scenes where Therese is not present: Carol with her husband, talking with Abby, meetings with her lawyer.
  Negative
Thesemay provide context for Carol's behavior but it also lessens the tension and creates confusion, since the majority of "Carol" is told so obviously from Therese's point of view that the camera is literally Therese's eye.
  Negative
Carol, ironically, is a stronger character when seen from a distance.
  Neutral
Blanchett is a naturally theatrical actress, unafraid of being "dramatic."
  Positive
Because of this, she sometimes seems out of place in a realistic context.
  Negative
But "Carol" plays to her strengths.
  Positive
"Performing" is how Carol gets through her life, so every gesture is a "bit": the way she lights a cigarette, or tosses her hair back, even the way she looks at Therese across the table.
  Negative
These are "acts," moments of assessment to make sure the coast is clear.
  Negative
When Carol does let down her guard, it's breathtaking because her surface is performed so flawlessly.
  Positive
Rooney Mara is given less to work with, mainly because Nagy's adaptation has erased Therese's backstory.

  Negative

  Positive
In one scene, Therese sits in the back seat of a taxi, watching a man and a woman walk down the sidewalk holding hands.
  Negative
In , Patricia Highsmith wrote the following in her journal: It was no doubt a tragedy that I saw "Forbidden" written like a word in red paint, "Stop," and could read it, when I was six... It's perhaps a tragedy I had to swallow my precious stone At sixteen, watching careless boys and girls Walking hand in hand down public streets, As indifferent to what people thought of them As they were to their own sensations... Therese, as in love as that couple on the sidewalk, cannot hold hands with Carol in public, and does not expect to ever be free like that.
  Very negative
It is one of the most poignant moments in "Carol" because of its telescope out into the universal.
  Positive
