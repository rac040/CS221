"The Witch," a period dramahorror film by first-time writerdirector  Robert Eggers, tellingly advertises itself as "a New England folktale" instead of a fairy tale.
  Negative
Fairy tales are, at heart, parables that prescribe moral values.
  Positive
"The Witch," a feminist narrative that focuses on an American colonial family as they undergo what seems to be an otherworldly curse, is more like a sermon.
  Negative
Sermons pose questions that use pointedly allegorical symbols to make us reconsider our lives, just as one character uses the Book of Job to understand her role in her family more on Job shortly.
  Negative
But "The Witch" is not a morality play in a traditional sense.
  Negative
It's an ensemble drama about a faithless family on the verge of self-destruction.
  Neutral
And it is about women, and the patriarchal stresses that lead to their disenfranchisement.
  Positive
For a while, it is unclear which characteris exactly the focus of "The Witch."
  Negative
It's probably not grieving mother Katherine  Kate Dickie, though Eggers gives ample consideration to her mourningof infant son Samuel, who has disappeared under unusual circumstances.
  Negative
And it's definitely not Katherine's mischievous young twins Jonas and Mercy  Lucas Dawson and  Ellie Grainger, respectively,though Mercy does often speak for her and her brother's inability to understand how the world works after their family is banished to a foreboding forest by a nearby colony.
  Negative
The film's main protagonist might be William  Ralph Ineson, Katherine's troubled husband.
  Negative
Or it couldbe her eldest son Caleb  Harvey Scrimshaw, a young man desperateto defend his father from his mother's frustration.
  Neutral
But more often than not, "The Witch" concerns Thomasin  Anya Taylor-Joy, the eldest of Katherine and William's five children.
  Negative
Thomasin undergoes puberty under themistrustful eyes of her family, but realistically, they're not too concerned with her whencrops are failing, money is scarce, and Samuel is missing.
  Negative
Still, Thomasin absorbs the brunt of her family's anxieties: her younger siblings look to her for comfort, but she balks at the added pressure, especially after her mother makes her do more chores than the rest of her family members.
  Negative
There are other subplots in "The Witch," but all roads eventually lead to Thomasin.
  Neutral
That's the dark beauty of Eggers's expansive story: it's not just about the marginalized presence of women in a male-dominated microcosm, but the harsh conditions that can, even under extremely isolated circumstances, lead women to resentment, and crippling self-doubt.
  Negative
"The Witch" is, in that sense, an anti-parable.
  Positive
Eggers eventually leads Thomasin out of the woods, but he takes his time in clearing her path.
  Neutral
The result sometimes feels like an imaginary Harold Pinter-scripted version of " The Crucible," since it follows desperate, lonelysouls who do everything set animal traps, milk goats, till the fields, do laundry to avoid thinking about what's really troubling them.
  Negative
It takes a while for Thomasin's clan to even consider that their problems are caused by witch, or demonic enchantment.
  Negative
But it eventually happens.
  Neutral
Before that, there are only signs and portents, particularly evil-looking animals: a tetchygoat, a twitchyhare, and some talkativecrows.
  Negative
Eventually, Thomasin's family personify their fears of nature, a gnawing uncertainty that is predictably gendered as feminine.
  Negative
And suddenly, the family's day-to-day troubles almost all of which stem from the fact that their land seems cursed takes the form of a fairy tale witch.
  Negative
Which brings us back to Job.
  Neutral
In the Book of Job, God hurts Job in order to test hisfaith.
  Negative
The reader knows that God exists, and has a divine, or perhaps just Mysterious, reason for trying Job.
  Neutral
But until Job's body is plagued by God, he doesn't question that there is a reason for his torment.
  Negative
The same is basically true of William and his family.
  Positive
Until eventslead his family to start clawing at each other's throats, he goes about his business as best he can.
  Positive
As a result, when you watch "The Witch," you often don't seem to know what the film is about.
  Negative
Butthe film's title is a big clue: this is a fantasy about empowerment, albeit through unorthodox methods.
  Positive
I've talked a lot about what "The Witch" is about without mentioning how well it's about it.
  Negative
That's partly because the film is so consistently engrossing that I surrendered to it early on.
  Positive
Eggers' hyper-mannered camerawork draws you in by evoking Johannes Vermeer's portraits and the landscape paintings of Andrew Wyeth there's also an overt reference to one of Francisco Goya's more famouspaintings, but I can't tell you which one for fear of ruining a surprise.
  Negative
The complex sound design and controlled editing also help establish a mood that is paradoxically both inviting and somber.
  Positive
"The Witch" draws you in so well that you won't realize its creators have been broadcasting exactly where they're taking you.
  Positive
