If you're watching " The Stranger," a gruesome and perilously underlit ie: mysterious indie horror film, you're probably watching it because the film's full title is " Eli Roth Presents The Stranger."
  Negative
This is especially ironic since "The Green Inferno," Roth's appropriately icky homage to Italian cannibal chillers like "Cannibal Holocaust," has had trouble finding an audience beyond film festivals it's currently scheduled for a September th theatrical release and is worth seeking out.
  Neutral
Still, "The Stranger" is not really like Roth's films since that implies it has a sense of humor, and is effectively unnerving.
  Positive
Instead, "The Stranger" is a one-trick film with strained self-seriousness that rests squarely on the shoulders of a plot twist.
  Negative
It's a lousy little film that is so dark and joyless that it leaves you feeling like you wasted your time watching it.
  Very negative
But while "The Stranger" is bad, the fact that it makes you wait and wait for its excessively dismal perspective to be justified by a measly little twist is even worse.
  Very negative
How to describe "The Stranger" without giving its only novelty?
  Neutral
Here's a film that struggles to impress viewers with its humanity by immediately impressing us with sadistic violence.
  Neutral
An aura of un-pleasantness surrounds drifter Martin  Cristobal Tapia Montt, a man with a past who returns to his old Anytown USA home, and discovers that his wife Ana  Lorenza Izzo is long dead.
  Negative
Martin consequently tries to kill himself by having local thug Caleb  Ariel Levy slay him in a fit of pique.
  Neutral
But, as we soon find out through a series of flashbacks, Martin was suicidal well before he learned of Ana's demise.
  Negative
And Martin doesn't die easily.
  Negative
Because Martin's problems are the main source of conflict in "The Stranger," the film's pitilessly grim drama serves to confirm its main character's myopically cynical perspective.
  Negative
And then we get an unearned happy ending!
  Positive
The disconnect between the ugly world that viewers inhabit for the majority of "The Stranger" and the unconvincing glimmer of hope that the film concludes with is vast and contains a multitude of macho posturing.
  Negative
Writerdirector  Guillermo Amoedo co-writer of Roth-helmed "The Green Inferno" and "Knock Knock" fixates on violence like it were a meaningful fact of life.
  Negative
We see Caleb, a pasty-white punk who looks like he's auditioning for the role of "Heavy " in a " Death Wish" reboot, slowly sink a switch-blade into Peter's gut without Martin doing anything to stop him.
  Negative
This is after Caleb threatens Martin, and Martin does nothing but glower impassively.
  Negative
Martin wants to be hurt, so viewers feel Martin's pain throughout "The Stranger."
  Negative
In another key scene, we experience an assault from the point-of-view of Peter Nicolas Duran, a sullen teenage graffiti artist who confirms Martin's moribund perspective by tagging walls with trite doom-sayings like "The end is near."
  Negative
Since Peter predictably befriends Martin despite Martin's epithet-heavy protests, he inevitably attracts Caleb's attention.
  Neutral
And when Caleb tries to dispatch Peter by kicking him a lot, and then lighting him on fire, we experience Peter's assault from Peter's point-of-view.
  Negative
We see flashes of Caleb's feet and legs flash before the camera's surrogate eye.
  Positive
And we hear muffled blows landing.
  Neutral
Then there's a burst of flame, and we know that someone has caught fire.
  Neutral
That conflagration isn't supposed to be sensational though, just ugly, brutal, and hyper-real.
  Negative
Martin's dire worldview isn't repugnant just because it's monotonous, and unproductively vicious.
  Negative
Amoedo also validates Martin's outlook by revealing early on that corrupt local police lieutenant De Luca  Luis Gnecco is Caleb's dad.
  Negative
So nobody has a chance in this film because even the cops are crooked.
  Negative
Peter's desperate single mom Monica  Alessandra Guerzoni is equally impotent, as is De Luca's partner Officer Harris  Aaron Burns.
  Negative
Harris's presence is especially frustrating though since he seems to live to serve as De Luca's punching bag.
  Negative
Harris cringes, does his job by the book, and generally tries to do good.
  Positive
So naturally he's repeatedly punished for his diligence.
  Negative
What value then does the major twist at the heart of "The Stranger" have?
  Positive
Not much, unless you crave further validation of Martin's nihilistic philosophy.
  Negative
There are moments throughout the film that suggest that Martin is wrong, and that people are better than he gives them credit for.
  Negative
But many of these scenes feel tacked-on when they should be the entire point of "The Stranger."
  Negative
The film's relentless drab-ness seriously, could they not afford better lighting rigs?
  Negative
is suffocating, but what really rankles is Amoedo's half-hearted attempt at waving away his film's abundant nastiness by half-heartedly suggesting that even long-suffering masochists can do good too.
  Very negative
If the world outside your door ever looks as bleak as it does in "The Stranger," don't find religion: seek out a good therapist.
  Negative
