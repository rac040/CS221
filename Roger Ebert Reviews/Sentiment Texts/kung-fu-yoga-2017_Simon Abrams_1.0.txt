Jackie Chan is one of the rare action film stars to grapple and sometimes successfully adjust to his old age.
  Very positive
Movies like "Little Big Soldier," " Police Story: Lockdown," and "Chinese Zodiac" acknowledge Chan's limitations as a performer whose body has been through every conceivable punishment in order to nail the next big scene.
  Negative
"Kung Fu Yoga," his latest star vehicle, re-teams him with writerdirector  Stanley Tong, the filmmaker who helmed classic Chan films like "Supercop" and "Rumble in the Bronx."
  Negative
But"Kung Fu Yoga" doesn't feel like a young man's film.
  Negative
Normally that would be a cause for celebration, but in this case, Chan's latest doesn't just address, but rather shows his age.
  Negative
Unlike "Chinese Zodiac," the third and final entry in Chan's stunt-intensive, "Indiana Jones"-style "Armour of God" films, "Kung Fu Yoga" is bogged down by pretty much everything but Jackie Chan.
  Negative
It's a tribute to Chinese-Indian cultural relations!
  Positive
It's a showcase for seriously unimpressive co-stars!
  Negative
It's an unconvincing homage to the majesty of nature!
  Negative
It's a showcase for boring-looking computer-generated zoo animals!
  Positive
Wait, isn't this a Jackie Chan film?
  Neutral
Chanplays Jack, a well-respected university professor who specializes inChineseIndian history.
  Neutral
Like Indiana Jones before him, Jack insists that everything valuable belongs to the worlda museum.
  Negative
So, after enlisting the help of his teaching assistantsZhuYixing Zhang and Nuomin Miya Muqi, Jack inevitably embarks on a quest to dig up buried treasure that takes him from Tibet's frozen tundrasto Dubai's urban sprawl.
  Negative
Along the way, Jack's group gets attacked by Randall Sonu Snood, a descendant of the treasure trove's owners.But conflict only ensues  minutes later , after Jack bores us to tears with a multi-part history lesson about the treasure's past.
  Negative
Chan wants to make history come alive!
  Neutral
so he lectures us multiple times!!
  Neutral
after an equally boring ""-style battle sequence that pits ferocious Indian soldiers riding elephants against ingenious killing machine Chinese soldiers.
  Negative
A scuffle ensues, then a really dull auction for more treasure, then he drives a car with a computer-generated lion in it, and then the rest of the movie keeps right on happening.
  Negative
I can't tell a lie: "Kung-Fu Yoga" is a stinker.
  Very negative
It is so miscalculated that it briefly made me forget why I love Jackie Chan films.
  Negative
The action scenes are modest, and therefore easy to ignore when you're watching a scene where computer-generated hyenas attack underwhelming supporting cast members Zhang, Muqi, and their equally stiff co-star  Amyra Dastur, who plays an assistant to Indian archaeologist Ashmita  Disha Patani.
  Negative
"Kung-Fu Yoga" has some good slapstick comedy and adequate fight scenes, but notnearly enough to justify sticking it out for  excruciating minutes.
  Negative
I mean, yes, do come for the scene where Chan literally pulls the rug out from under some heavies.
  Negative
And be sure to pony up if you want to see a clever joke where he psyches out a baddy just by making the same huffing and puffing noises that he produces while physically over-exerting himself.
  Negative
But don't say I didn't warn you when you get to the eccentric in the worst possible sense sequence where Chan warns Randall that treasure is "immaterial" since "Everything is empty.
  Negative
The material is not different from the immaterial.
  Negative
The immaterial and the material are one and the same."
  Neutral
Chan might have pulled a pseudo-spiritual line like this when he was a younger star, but he would have thrown in a wink and a few good pratfalls too.
  Negative
Now we're stuck with Old Man Jackie Chan, an unironic onscreen persona that Chan has been honing for decades now.Old Man Jackie Chan isn't completely humorless, but his jokes are fit for a grandpa, like when he gets drunk and sings Adele in " Skiptrace" or when he fights the above-mentioned computer-generated lion in "Kung Fu Yoga."
  Negative
The man is clearly adjusting to what he can and can't do anymore, a concern that is probably more pressing for Chan since he has a metal rod for a spine, several plastic plates in his skull, and has suffered more broken bones than was previously known to be inside the human body.
  Negative
There's not much left of young Jackie Chan, so we might as well get used to Old Man Jackie Chan.
  Negative
In the meantime, go see " Railroad Tigers," Chan's recent war-movie action-adventure.
  Negative
It's got much better action choreography, a stronger supporting cast, neat trains, and quips that aren't totally cringeworthy.
  Positive
You can skip "Kung Fu Yoga," trust me.
  Negative
