Stphane Lafleurs great Tu dors Nicole is a remarkable tonal balancing act in such a way that its difficult to figure out how he pulls it off.
  Positive
It is both light as a feather and emotionally resonant.
  Positive
It is defiantly episodic and yet has a cumulative power in its storytelling.
  Positive
It is both airy and emotionally lived-in at the same time.
  Positive
Lafleur captures something about those hazy days of early adulthood in which moments that feel like they have no importance suddenly do.
  Positive
Its about that unique window of time in which our friends sometimes move at a different pace than we do, making decisions we dont understand.

  Very positive
Nicole  Julianne Ct has graduated from college, lives at her absentee parents house theyre away for the summer and works a menial job that she doesnt particularly like.
  Positive
Theres not much going on in her small Quebec hometown, as evidenced by Nicoles casual observations of the neighbors around her doing menial things like cleaning up dog poop and dusting light fixtures.
  Negative
THIS is adulthood.
  Neutral
No need to race too quickly to get to it.
  Neutral
And so Nicole kind of floats through life with best friend Vronique Catherine St-Laurent until the two mentally stumble upon a plan to take a trip to Iceland.
  Positive
Nicole just got a credit card, and its like everything is free, right?
  Positive
As they practice Icelandic, Nicoles plan is derailed by the return of her brother Remi  Marc-Andr Grondin, who wants to use his parents pad as a band practice location.
  Negative
His bassist is on the verge of fatherhood, which leads Remi to dire predictions about the future of the band, while he also hopes that their new drummer will end a line of replacements at that position.
  Negative
It doesnt help that Vronique seems drawn to the newest band member.
  Positive
Theres a fantastic series of scenes in which Vronique goes from Nicoles side in one scene to talking to the band in another to singing with them.
  Positive
Nicole has only one real friend and they were going to run away together?
  Negative
What will this do to that plan?
  Neutral
Lafleur has an amazing eye and voice when it comes to the eccentricities of smalltown life.
  Positive
The most memorable character in this quirky milieu is Martin played by Godefroy Reding and voiced by Alexis Lefebvre, a -year-old who hit puberty early and sounds like a grown man, playfully hitting on his former babysitter.
  Neutral
Nicole and Vroniques employers feel like characters of their own as well.
  Positive
But the film belongs to Nicole, even if Lafleur is careful not to overplay the perspective piece approach.
  Positive
We regularly watch Nicole leave the frame and then cut to another scene with her, as if were watching her from afar without being asked to understand all of her thoughts and motives a common problem of the coming-of-age drama.
  Negative
About that visual style: Lafleur and cinematographer Sara Mishara shot Tu dors Nicole in beautiful black-and-white, setting up visual compositions that are both gorgeous and thematically resonant.
  Positive
The striking imagery of Tu dors Nicole Mishara crafts amazing imagery from the mundane such as a shot of Nicole in aisles of clothing or barely lit by the illumination of a sewing machine adds to the dreamlike nature of the piece.
  Positive
The summer after college is a hazy time for most of us putting away childish concerns without fully understanding what it means to be an adult.
  Negative
After playing miniature golf, Nicole turns to Vronique and says, This used to be more fun.
  Negative
We can all relate.
  Neutral
Misharas stunning cinematography and Lafleurs direction wouldnt matter without the lived-in, genuine performance from Ct.
  Positive
She is tasked with a difficult role in that Nicole is more often a casual observer of the world around her than someone who comments on it.
  Positive
And yet Ct is very careful to not turn Nicole into a snarky misanthrope.
  Negative
She is more uncertain than derisive, which makes her relatable and likable.
  Positive
We want Nicole to find something that makes her happy, or something that makes her anything at all.
  Positive
Unlike so many coming-of-age films, Lafleur offers no easy answers or pat clichs about early-life crises.
  Negative
He merely gives us a character floating through a definitive summer in her life.
  Positive
And then leaves her there, still floating towards an unknowable future.
  Negative
