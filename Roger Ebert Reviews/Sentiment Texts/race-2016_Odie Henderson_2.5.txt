Race takes a complicated, messy story and shapes it with the bland cookie-cutter mold too often seen in the biopic genre.
  Negative
The predictability of its storytelling beats isnt really the problem, for there is comfort to be found in the dance of the familiar.
  Negative
The issue here is the tone of the material.
  Neutral
Writers  Joe Shrapnel and  Anna Waterhouse coddle the viewer, never once hitting us with the full brunt of the current and future horrors experienced by Blacks in America and the Jews in Germany during this period.
  Negative
Its as if an undiluted moment of true discomfort or complexity would destroy rather than amplify the uplifting moments.
  Negative
Additionally, the films subject, Jesse Owens, has to share his tale with someone who deserves to be the subject of her own movie.
  Negative
While the ads hype Owens heroism, they dont tell you that Race sees propaganda filmmaker  Leni Riefenstahl as an equally big hero.This may work for cinephiles, but it left a sour aftertaste for me.
  Negative
Owens story is a fascinating tale of record-breaking athleticism enacted in a time of racism and anti-Semitism.
  Positive
Shady, controversial dealings stopped an Olympic boycott and enabled the United States to compete in the  Berlin Olympics.
  Negative
The games were presented by Adolf Hitler and Joseph Goebbels as proof of Aryan superiority, yet their athletic German engineering was no match for a man deemed inferior to Whites by the United States and Nazi Germany.
  Negative
Owens a fine  Stephan James from  Selma chose to defy a boycott-favoring consensus that included the NAACP in order to live his dream of Olympic glory, yet when he returned with four gold medals, his heroics were no match for the racist status quo.
  Negative
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt wouldnt congratulate nor meet with him, and Owens couldnt use the front door of the Waldorf-Astoria to attend a dinner held in his honor.
  Negative
To its credit, Race ably covers all this material.
  Negative
But this is an easily distracted movie.
  Very negative
For example, theres an interminable subplot involving Owens dalliance with a woman who was not his high school sweethearteventual wife Ruth  Shanice Banton.
  Negative
It goes nowhere except to the land of clich, serving as a means to inject conflict into the Owens relationship.
  Negative
More time is spent on Riefenstahl interacting with people than Owens bonding with his teammates or training.
  Negative
Despite an admirable attempt by Banton and James to bring a sense of romance to their underwritten scenes, and James enjoyable interactions with a surprisingly good Jason Sudekis as Coach Larry Snyder, it often feels as if Jesse Owens is trotted out simply to win theracesthat made him famous.
  Negative
The solid cast is rounded out with veteran actors including  Jeremy Irons and  William Hurt, both of whom elevate the material.
  Very positive
Irons, as Avery Brundage, is especially good here' he brings a Trump-like essence toall the showy, non-athletic scenes.
  Positive
Whether hes arguing with Hurts Jeremiah Mahoney or negotiating with  Barnaby Metschurats Goebbels for an appearances-sake only moratorium on the harsh treatment of Jewish people, Irons is a commanding presence even if you know the film is downplaying some of the more sinister aspects of his storyline.
  Neutral
Director  Stephen Hopkins shoots the film, and the bigraces, with minimal fuss or theatrics, but he does have one superbly showy moment when Owens first enters the Olympics stadium.
  Positive
The tricky camerawork, the CGI crowd and James awed reaction work together to present a you are there moment thats truly captivating.
  Very positive
James is also quite convincing in Owens heats, running in the same manner Owens would have back in .
  Negative
The best scenes in the film occur in this section, when Owens meets Carl Luz Long David Kross, a German rival who later becomes a very good friend.
  Positive
Longs admiration for the man he hoped to beat led him to violate several unspoken rules of the games, including celebrating with Owens after he breaks the long jump record.These scenes highlight what Race could have been had it focused more on Owens personal relationships.
  Negative
Since there has only been one other telling of Owens story the  TV movie starring  Dorian Harewood and  Debbi Morgan Race is to be commended for bringing a new generation to this American hero.
  Negative
I can see it being shown in high schools as a teaching tool and to track teams like the one I once ran on in my youth.
  Negative
But Im giving the film a marginally negative grade for three reasons, none of which should prohibit you from seeing Race if you so desire.
  Negative
First, the Leni Riefenstahl scenes are completely out of place.
  Neutral
Its not that she shouldnt have been in the movie after all, her Olympia which Ive seen and is quite interesting captured the footage of Owens to which we otherwise would never have borne witness nor is it because of Carice Van Houtens Black Book performance shes good.
  Neutral
Its out of place because Race doesnt acknowledge why Riefenstahl was there in the first place: to document the supposed superiority of the Whiterace.
  Negative
She got lucky, from a filmmaking perspective, when Owens showed up to kick ass, but she had no idea hed cause that much of a stir.
  Negative
Race instead presents her as a Hitler-defying subversive, standing up to Goebbels in a scene I simply did not buy.
  Negative
Riefenstahl deserves her own movie, and should have been on the sidelines of this one.
  Positive
Second, this material needed a little more edge and darkness.
  Neutral
Hopkins cant even let the powerful scene of the Owens entering the side entrance of the Waldorf affect and leave us with sadness and anger.
  Negative
The film interrupts it with a staged moment of hope, as If to say see, it wasnt all that bad!
  Very positive
It was that bad.
  Negative
Third, Race is very good at showing us what Jesse Owens did, but falters at showing us who Jesse Owens was.
  Positive
When the film is over, ask yourself if you thought he was completely fleshed out as a character.
  Negative
That may not bug you as much as it did me, so I wont begrudge you if Race makes you stand up and cheer with impunity.
  Negative
