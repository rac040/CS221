A thin, problematic and amateurishly-made documentary, " O'Clock Boys" plays like two films awkwardly grafted together.
  Very negative
One documents the criminally boisterous antics of the eponymous Boys, hundreds of young African-American men most appear to be in their late teens, s and s who ritualistically roar around inner-city Baltimore on loud motorbikes, ignoring all traffic laws, endangering the citizenry and defying the police, who have little chance of impeding the rampant law-breaking since they're forbidden to give chase due to concerns over public safety.
  Negative
The other film, meanwhile, is a verite-style portrait of Pug, a cocky, cute and exceedingly camera-friendly inner-city -year-old, whose troubles at home and school find a welcome escape valve in his adulation of the Boys and desire to join their ranks.
  Positive
Given the film's title, you might expect the first of those elements to dominate, with Pug's tale being a unifying thread that runs through the narrative.
  Negative
But that's not the case.
  Negative
The footage of the Boys much of it from the cell phones and video cameras of onlookers mostly comes up front, sometimes interspersed with bland TV news reports about their public disturbances and the cops' unavailing efforts to deal with them.
  Negative
Thereafter most of the film is devoted to following Pug's life, which often has little or nothing directly to do with the Boys.
  Negative
If this imbalance seems curious, a couple of reasons for it are readily evident.
  Positive
First, once you've seen  minutes or so of the Boys doing their police-baiting wheelies and other stunts, you get the picture' jaw-dropping as it sometimes is, much more of it would quickly become redundant and tedious.
  Negative
Second, as the film's young director,  Lotfy Nathan, told Rolling Stone, he didn't want to make an "issues film."
  Neutral
"Issues films," and the "talking heads" they often entail, have become increasingly unfashionable on the documentary festival and art-house circuits, for reasons that are worth examination and discussion.
  Negative
Suffice to say here that, in choosing to avoid such an approach, Nathan radically limits his authorial options and thus the avenues of understanding he offers viewers regarding the film's titular subject.
  Negative
As a result of this choice, while we see the Boys roaring around Baltimore, we get very little sense of who they are as individuals or the context in which they operate.
  Negative
We hear nothing from community leaders, black or white, much less experts talking heads!
  Negative
on this milieu or such automotive sociopathic behavior.
  Neutral
Though we are told that the Boys' dangerous exploits have resulted in the death of one child, the attitudes resulting from this in the community are barely touched on.
  Negative
And naturally, the police are given no voice at all.
  Negative
So if he's not making an "issues film," one that would include various points of view and enough information to challenge the viewer with the complexity of its subject, what is he making?
  Negative
Well, clearly: an entertainment film.
  Positive
And a very specific type at that: a film by a white filmmaker it's very hard to imagine " O'Clock Boys" made by an African-American that spectacularizes black criminality for white middle-class viewers, the primary audience for the festivals and art houses where this film will have its career.
  Negative
Surely, criminality isn't the sum total of this tale.
  Negative
There's a scene where a black adult takes a group of kids out in the country to ride their dirt bikes and ATVs, and here we get a bracing sense of what an exhilarating escape from their hemmed-in normal lives such jaunts are.
  Positive
But would the film be in theaters if it contained only this kind of law-abiding outing?
  Neutral
For that matter, would it be garnering such warm reviews if the criminality it depicted were committed by white Long Island lunkheads, or Texas rednecks?
  Negative
Running a scant  minutes, " O'Clock Boys" still feels twice as long as it needs to be.
  Negative
One can imagine interesting ways Nathan could have extended it to feature length.
  Very positive
For example he might have shown it to Jesse Jackson and asked his reaction.
  Negative
Or  Bill Cosby.
  Neutral
Or Coretta Scott King.
  Neutral
Or Michelle Obama.
  Neutral
But of course such comments almost surely would have done the one thing that Nathan's approach can't afford to do: problematize the film for white viewers by allowing its own white viewpoint to be challenged.
  Negative
Indeed, this itself might have made for a far more interesting film.
  Negative
To me the doc's most intriguing passage comes in its first minute, when, over a shot of Pug looking particularly puppyish, we hear the voice of a white man presumably on a radio call-in show opining that the problem of "little scumbags on dirt bikes" terrorizing parts of Baltimore can't be frankly discussed because the perps are black.
  Negative
Presumably Nathan regards this as a completely unacceptable view, and puts it up front simply in order to dismiss it.
  Negative
But what if it had opened the door to a discussion throughout the film about the issues the comment raises, including how a film like this one uses its subjects for entertainment value rather an inquiry into social dysfunction, and the question of whether white people who imagine their view of the Boys to be tolerant and sympathetic even hip and fashion-forward are not in fact being patronizing and demeaning?
  Neutral
I'm not suggesting any ready answers to these questions, simply that it would be good to hear them asked.
  Negative
