The journey in Tommy Lee Jones' "The Homesman", based on the  novel  by  Glendon Swarthout, travels from west to east, from the unmarked  Nebraska territory to a town in Iowa.
  Negative
It is a reverse trajectory of the  typical Western path, the wildness of the prairies and plains reverting,  startlingly, to a tame village perched on the edge of the placid  Missouri River.
  Negative
When civilization finally arrives in the final section  of the film, it seems palpably fragile' what has come before is so  unremittingly desolate.
  Negative
"The Homesman," despite the title, is about  women.
  Positive
Women are the center of the action, women drive the action  forward, women are not only damsels in distress but heroic figures of  grit and courage sometimes in the same moment.
  Neutral
The men are helpless  bystanders or ambiguous allies.
  Negative
There is only one villain in the film,  and he is a villain because he is callous.
  Negative
He lacks empathy.
  Negative
Tommy Lee  Jones, as a director, homes in on the surreal aspects of the story with  beautiful sensitivity and strangeness "The Homesman" is an extremely  strange film, highlighting the monotony of the landscape in which  figures are either dwarfed by the vastness of it or tower above the flat  horizon.
  Negative
The West, as seen in "The Homesman," is an unforgiving place,  with flashes of stark and nightmarish beauty.
  Positive
Three women have lost  their minds in "The Homesman," but honestly, everyone you meet in the  film is slightly crazy, the homesman most of all.
  Positive
Nobody is a pillar of  mental health.
  Negative
Sanity, then, could be seen as overrated, especially in a  world like the one in "The Homesman."
  Negative
And those who lose their minds  may very well be the only realists in the story.
  Positive
These are deeply  suggestive ideas, and when "The Homesman" works best it teeters around  in that morally ambiguous territory.
  Positive
It's a risky film.
  Neutral
Sometimes the  risks pay off, sometimes they don't, but the feeling of risk infuses the  film with chaos, humor, violence, beauty.
  Positive
"The Homesman" doesn't play  things safe, and that's a welcome change.
  Positive
Mary Bee Cuddy  Hilary Swank is a middle-aged woman, born in upstate  New York, who has bought land in the Nebraska territory.
  Positive
She is  unmarried and farms the land herself.
  Positive
She yearns to buy a piano and  comforts herself by playing hymns on a cloth keyboard.
  Neutral
She is seen early  on proposing marriage to a farmer who owns land adjacent to hers.
  Negative
She  pitches it as a business proposition, although there is an urgent need  and fragility beneath her words that tell a different story.
  Negative
He turns  her down pretty bluntly: "You're too bossy and you're too damn plain."
  Negative
It hurts, it hurts bad, but Mary Bee does not pity herself.
  Negative
She has too  much work to do.
  Negative
During the tail-end of a particularly terrible winter, three women in  the area descend into varying degrees of psychosis, dissociation,  self-harm, and derangement.
  Negative
It is clear that they need to be transported  to a place that can treat them, and the minister  John Lithgow has a  connection with a church in Iowa that has agreed to take them in.
  Positive
When  the menfolk in the congregation balk at the job of transport, Mary Bee  takes it on.
  Negative
A glorified paddy wagon is provided, complete with iron  rings on the interior in order to chain the women in place, should it be  necessary.
  Negative
The journey will be dangerous and long, and Mary Bee needs to  hire a homesman, and George Briggs, a drunken out-for-himself  claim-jumper, is just the man for the job.
  Negative
Mary Bee pitches it to him  with the same matter-of-fact tone that she proposed marriage, telling  him exactly what she needs and expects, and exactly what she will not  tolerate.
  Negative
He's a bit of a buffoon, in his filthy long-johns and whining  voice, but he needs the money.
  Negative
The early introduction of the three madwomen is presented hauntingly by  Jones.
  Negative
The images flash onto the screen, interrupting the main action of  Mary Bee at her farm, and Jones crafts a collage of terror and  dread.
  Negative

  Negative
Arabella  Grace Gummer is a teenager, with a young husband,  and her three babies died in a matter of days from diphtheria.
  Negative
She has  gone comatose, staring out the window, clutching a rag doll.
  Negative
Theoline   Miranda Otto is shown strolling outside into a biting snowstorm, a  wailing purple newborn nipping at her bare breast, and she casually  tosses the baby down the hole in the outhouse' the most harrowing image  in the film.
  Very negative
The presentation of madness is both compassionate and  unblinking.
  Very positive
Briggs is a comic figure in the beginning, a drawling and  inappropriately insouciant Walter Brennan-type character, garrulous and  careless, demanding Mary Bee buy him a jug of whiskey for the ride.
  Negative
The  dynamic between Briggs and pious straight-talking spinster is one of the  pleasures of the film.
  Positive
It almost becomes a classic buddy picture.
  Positive
Both  characters are outlaws.
  Neutral
Neither of them fit into "normal" society.
  Neutral
Both  of them are individualists, who value strength, who have strength, but  who will always be just a little bit on the periphery of accepted norms.
  Negative
This could be seen as a tragedy for them' it could be seen as a  triumph.
  Negative
The film does not come down on either side.
  Negative
The situation is  not "eitheror".
  Negative
It is "bothand."
  Neutral
There are confrontations with the elements during the journey' there are  moments when they lose control of the women.
  Negative
One breaks free' one  kicks the other in the face' one is unable or unwilling to handle her own  bodily functions as Briggs lifts her skirt up for her and barks, "Squat now.
  Negative
Come on.
  Neutral
Pee."
  Neutral
At first wary with one another, and at  some moments damn near confrontational, Briggs and Mary Bee find that  they are good partners, tag-teaming the job, and talking at night over  the crackling fire as the three women lie tied up to the wagon wheels,  asleep or in a daze.
  Positive
For most of the film, it is Mary Bee's story.
  Positive
She is its anchor, and  Briggs is her sidekick.
  Positive
Something happens three-fourths of the way through that  puts Briggs in the center, as the title character.
  Positive
Having not read the  novel, the moment came as an enormous surprise, almost shattering the  fabric of the film, as harrowing, in its way, of the vision of the  mother throwing her baby into the privy hole.
  Negative
In thinking back on it,  there are fragments of behavior shown, glimpses of inner life, that  makes that moment inevitable, in retrospect.
  Negative
The film expands  exponentially as the formal narrative is destabilized, and things get  distinctly stranger, although Jones keeps his eye on the overall theme  of madness and survival' trauma and strength.
  Very positive
The strangest section of the film involves a stop-over at the Fairfield  Hotel, standing alone in the middle of the plains, like an Andrew Wyeth  painting, reminiscent of Sam Shepard's house in Terrence  Malick's " Days of Heaven."
  Negative
The smooth-talking Irishman proprietor  James Spader hopes to  attract investors to this little spot in the middle of nowhere,  surrounded by sheer emptiness.
  Negative
So he's a little nuts, too.
  Negative
Beautifully conceived and  shot, the section is a tangent, but it is extremely revealing about  Briggs' character, as well as a sardonic, pointed commentary about the  concept of civilization.
  Neutral
Civilization, as represented by the small  huddle of farms out in Nebraska, does its best to help those who need  it.
  Positive
Civilization, as represented by the tiny town in Iowa, is kind and  genteel, although it doesn't quite know what to do with a man like  Briggs.
  Positive
Elsewhere, though, like at the totally empty Fairfield Hotel,  with its sideboard heaped with luscious food, and its paintings of naked  women in the lobby, civilization is cold and unfeeling.
  Negative
There is an  argument to be made that the only place where someone like Briggs, or  someone like Mary Bee, could ever hope to "fit in" is out there in the  unmarked territories, cutting their way into the land, relying only on  themselves, a landscape where eccentricity is an asset.
  Negative
Jones' visual style is simple and clean, and cinematographer Rodrigo  Prieto finds some gorgeous  John Ford touches' people shown in black  silhouette through barn doorways, or house doorways, with the vast  bright landscape beyond, a clear demarcation between interior and  exterior, displaying the individual against the sheer size of the land out there.
  Positive
There's a section where Mary Bee gets separated from the wagon and  wanders the plains through the dark night on her horse, disoriented and  lost, calling out for Briggs, resorting to chewing on grass like a feral  creature.
  Very negative
These dark sequences have the hallucinatory quality of a  nightmare.
  Negative
Novelist Glendon Swarthout was interested in unlikely characters who  have to show extraordinary courage and strength.
  Negative
He was interested in  the moral ambiguities of familiar genres.
  Positive
The best example of this comes  in his most famous book, "Bless the Beasts and the  Children" which has never gone out of print since it was  published in . "
  Positive
Bless the Beasts and the Children"  tells the story of a group of misfit kids who have been sent to a boys'  homedude ranch in the American Southwest.
  Negative
Turned into a film in ,  directed by  Stanley Kramer, it takes the age-old themes of the Western  man vs. nature, man vs. the landscape, man vs. himself and pours it  into the service of a modern coming-of-age drama.
  Very positive
"The Homesman," like  "Bless the Beasts" questions the "norm".
  Negative
It asks questions about what  strength looks like in men and in women, and also what strength might  actually mean, what it signifies.
  Positive
Holding a rifle on an enemy requires  strength.
  Negative
So does being kind and caring to someone who has descended  into psychosis.
  Negative
Jones puts all of those elements on a level playing  field.
  Positive
Women are misfits here because of their biology.
  Neutral
Biology could be  seen as an enemy: motherhood is wonderful, but terrible when your  infant triplets all die on the same day.
  Negative
And what of those, like Mary  Bee, who have been denied the "natural" outlet for women, through  wifehood and motherhood?
  Negative
What does biology mean then?
  Neutral
The final section of the film is suddenly conventional, and represents a  confused petering-out of strength, a tame meandering coda to the  chaotic thrust of the story.
  Negative
It's almost like "The Homesman," barreling  along at a high speed, powerful and weird and funny and terrible, hits  an invisible speed bump all of a sudden, and the pieces fly apart.
  Negative
But  the conventional coda cannot erase the risk-filled pleasure of all that  came before.
  Negative
