In many ways, Melanie  Sennia Nanua is just another ordinary girl.
  Negative
She goes to school every day, where shes grown affection for her teacher Ms. Justineau  Gemma Arterton.
  Negative
And shes at that age where shes figuring out whats important to her, and how to navigate through the world of adults around her.
  Negative
But Melanie is not an ordinary girl.
  Neutral
She will soon be a mindless, soulless zombie, a braindead creature who responds only to a desire to kill and eat people around her.
  Negative
In fact, with the right triggers like if the adults around her forget to wear their scent-disguising lotion she could become that right now.
  Negative
Just when you thought the zombie genre was out of ideas, along comes  Colm McCarthys smart and engaging The Girl with All the Gifts, a film with echoes of  George A. Romero,  Danny Boyle, and Robert Kirkman but one that also feels confidently its own creation, a unique take on responsibility, adulthood, and a new chapter in evolution.
  Positive
Melanie isnt alone.
  Neutral
She lives with a number of other zombie-children like her in a bunker beneath a military facility, where shes being studied and experimented on by Dr. Caroline Caldwell  Glenn Close, in the hope that they could provide the antidote for what has essentially ended normal human existence.
  Negative
Melanie is one of several second-generation flesh-eaters called hungries, babies who literally ate their way out of their parents but are not behaving in precisely the same way as the brain-dead speedsters that have destroyed humanity.
  Negative
Whenever a child is found in the wild, theyre taken to this facility, where Dr. Caldwell can experiment on them and Sgt. Eddie Parks  Paddy Considine can work to control them.
  Negative
Said control involves leg, arm and head restraints whenever the children are anywhere near that oh-so-enticing human flesh.
  Negative
But Melanie seems so normal and is clearly learning empathy.
  Positive
The good doctor sees that as well, and even starts to loosen some of the restraints keeping Melanie more of an object than a person.
  Positive
Then one day Dr. Caldwell comes for Melanie, ready to dissect her and see exactly what she can learn from this unique child the hard way.
  Neutral
Before Dr. Justineau can save her, all hell breaks loose and the facility is overrun.
  Negative
A small group of survivors is forced to travel to another sanctuary city in the hope that its still being run by people who dont eat flesh.
  Negative
Melanie goes with them, and proves to be pretty useful.
  Positive
One of the major strengths of The Girl with All the Gifts is evident early in McCarthys tactile, believable world-building.
  Positive
Much as Romero paid close attention to such details, the set design, costumes, and the world of Gifts feels lived-in and genuine.
  Positive
And its a nature-based aesthetic dirt on walls, costumes that look worn, etc. that continues and even strengthens once this ragtag crew is forced from safety and into the dangerous world.
  Negative
Theres a visceral, emotional impact to the horror and action of The Girl with All the Gifts that resonates because the characters and the world they live in feels real to us.
  Positive
Its hard to overstate how important this to a horror movie, especially one set in a post-apocalyptic world.
  Positive
If we dont believe the world is genuine, we wont care what happens in it.
  Positive
Of course, performance goes a long way to amplify this believability as well, and its not often you see a horror film with a cast this strong.
  Positive
Close could have gone showy with her doctor with a heart of ice but she plays it straight, again conveying the believability of the moment more than the B-movie archetype this character could have become.
  Negative
Considine and Arterton perfectly convey authority and warmth, respectively, although theyre good enough to make these people into more than mere plot devices.
  Positive
And Nanua is a find, again never giving her performance with a knowing wink.
  Negative
So shes a zombie child who could be the evolutionary key to the future this just happens to be her reality.
  Negative
The traveling band aspect of The Walking Dead, the cities and landscapes empty of human existence of   Days Later, the military aspect of  Day of the Dead its easy to pick apart the influences of The Girl with All the Gifts.
  Negative
But just as Melanie marks something altogether new in this world a zombie with a conscience the film about her feels inspired by what came before but also good enough to inspire those that come after.
  Positive
