  Neutral
Cynicism falls away as they witness all the different creative aspects that go into making a film come together to show them sights they have never seen and tell them stories that are able to surprise while still resonating on the deepest of emotional levels.
  Negative
A truly great film the kind that one can call a classic without the slightest hesitation is one that still has the power to do that to viewers decades after it was originally released, no matter how many times they may have seen it over the years.
  Positive
Steven Spielbergs  masterpiece Close Encounters of the Third Kind, which is returning to theaters for a one-week engagement to mark its th anniversary, is the epitome of a truly great film.
  Very positive
Having seen it countless times over the past four decades, I went into the screening planning to devote most of my attention to how the new K restoration looked and found myself getting sucked as deeply into the story, the performances and the stunning visual effects as I was when I first saw it as a wee lad during its original release.
  Negative
You will notice that I have not referred to it as a science-fiction film and that is because, despite that it is roundly considered to be one of the pinnacles of the genre, it is not really one in the traditional sense, as Spielberg himself states in a brief featurette preceding screenings of the film.
  Negative
Oh sure, it does deal with the concept of mankinds first encounter with visiting beings from another world but it isnt really about them per se.
  Negative
Until the very end, the creatures themselves are kept off-screen and their presence is only represented sporadically via mysterious lights and fleeting glimpses of their spacecraft.
  Negative
In fact, the film is more of a drama with conspiracy thriller overtones that looks at how those of us on Earth might react to the possibility that there really is something out there by following two parallel narratives that eventually come together in the final act.
  Negative
In one, a coalition of scientists led by Claude Lacombe revered French filmmaker  Francois Truffaut dart around the world, investigating odd phenomena such as the appearance in the Sonora desert of a squadron of planes missing since  and working on a way of communicating with potential visitors based upon musical intonations.
  Negative
When they try it out, they do get a response that turns out to be coordinates for an apparent landing at the imposing Devils Tower monument in Wyoming.
  Negative
While Lacombe and the other scientists prepare for their arrival, the U.S. military tries to keep a lid on the story by launching a massive cover-up involving fake reports of a nerve gas spill intended to scare all civilians out of the area.
  Negative
In the other, we meet two Indiana residents whose paths cross and whose lives are changed forever after apparently encountering UFOs.
  Negative
The first is Roy Neary  Richard Dreyfuss, an ordinary family man and electrical lineman who is sent out to investigate massive power outages in the area and who has a very close encounter along the way.
  Negative
A dreamer by nature the kind of guy who is far more excited by the prospect of seeing  Pinocchio than his kids Roy is driven to distraction by his experience and the visions in his head of things he cannot adequately explain.
  Negative
It gets to the point where his less-than-sympathetic wife  Teri Garr grabs the kids and runs, while her neighbors cluck at the sight of his apparent lunacy.
  Negative
The other is Jillian Guiler  Melinda Dillon, a single mother whose -year-old son Barry Cary Guffey has a couple of encounters with the aliens that culminate with his abduction into the skies.
  Negative
Despite assurances from the government that there are no such things as flying saucers, Roy and Jillian will not be dissuaded and even after news of the alleged nerve gas spill is announced, they are still compelled to make their way to Devils Tower in the hopes of getting answers to the questions that are now dominating their lives.
  Negative
Close Encounters had what could be politely described as a troubled production many hands were employed to put the screenplay together though Spielberg wound up with the solo credit and the production ran over-schedule and over-budget but it is one of the films considerable achievements that there is not a hint of any of that in the finished product.
  Neutral
Even though it was only his third feature film, Spielberg directs the material with the assurance of a veteran director at the peak of his powers.
  Positive
The film moves like a shot yet it never feels overly rushed for a moment.
  Negative
It covers a wide variety of tones and emotions ranging from silly humor and wounding drama to genuine wonder and outright terror without ever ringing a false note.
  Positive
With the exception of Roys wife, who is perhaps drawn a little more shrill than necessary, the characters are believable and interesting, and the actors bring them all to life beautifully.
  Positive
The casting of Truffaut, that most humanist of filmmakers, as the lead scientist obsessed with making contact is especially inspired you may, as I do, prefer  Jean-Luc Godard as a filmmaker but you certainly wouldnt want him as the point man for our first encounter with beings from another world.
  Positive
From a technical standpoint, the film continues to be a marvel as well the Oscar-winning cinematography by  Vilmos Zsigmond with additional contributions from a virtual Murderers Row of the great cinematographers of the era is a thing of beauty, the score by  John Williams is the equal to his work on the other big genre film of  and the visual effects remain among the most impressive to ever grace a movie screen.

  Neutral
The moment when Lacombe realizes the link between Roy and the others who have come to Devils Tower They were invited.
  Neutral
Of course, there is also the simply spectacular finale, a sequence that should, by all rights, come off as either unbearably mawkish or kind of off-putting in regards to Roys attitude towards his family but somehow manages to avoid both of those traps.
  Negative
If you have seen Close Encounters of the Third Kind before and loved it, you owe it to yourself to see it again on the big screen where it belongs and in the best of the various versions the  iteration that includes virtually everything from the  original and the  Special Edition except for the ill-advised glimpse inside the spaceship produced especially for the latter.
  Negative
It is as good as you remember it and serves as a reminder of a time when blockbuster entertainments were still willing to show real ambition.
