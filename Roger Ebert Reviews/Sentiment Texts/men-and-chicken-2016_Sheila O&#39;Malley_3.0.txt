David Dencik and  Mads Mikkelsen play estranged brothers Gabriel and Elias, respectively, in writerdirector Anders Thomas Jensen's bizarre "Men amp' Chicken."
  Negative
The two men are thrown together when, after their father's death, some family secrets come to light.
  Negative
The comedy in "Men amp' Chicken" sometimes tips into Keystone Cops territory, with people running around in the background like chickens of course with their heads cut off.
  Negative
"Men amp' Chicken" is a bizarre family psychodrama as well as a mad-scientist movie, complete with a crazy spooky lab full of terrifying objects.
  Negative
How seriously should any of it be taken?
  Negative
It's hard to tell, but the film has a dry eccentricity that is entertaining and absurd.
  Negative
You don't know what will happen next.
  Negative
If the hundreds of chickens clucking around in the movie revealed themselves as sentient beings with the power of speech it wouldn't be a surprise at all.
  Negative
In the world of "Men amp' Chicken," all manner of ridiculous things seem possible.
  Negative
Gabriel and Elias set off together on a road trip to the isolated Ork Island population  to seek out the brothers they never knew they had.
  Negative
Both have cleft palates as well as personality quirks putting it mildly, and they can barely get through a conversation without running into intractable conflict.
  Negative
They have circular arguments about Darwin and Einstein.
  Neutral
"Einstein won the Nobel Prize, Elias."
  Positive
"Yes.
  Neutral
In , the lamest year in physics."
  Neutral
Elias is first seen on a date with a woman in a wheelchair who makes the fatal error of accidentally interrupting him.
  Negative
He snaps, "Do all people in wheelchairs interrupt this much?"
  Neutral
Not surprisingly, Elias has no luck with women, particularly unfortunate for him since his sex drive is so titanic that he needs to masturbate multiple times a day.
  Negative
Elias' "condition" is treated matter-of-factly by his brother who pulls over to the side of the road to let Elias get out and do his thing behind a tree.
  Negative
Gabriel is a philosophy professor who dry-retches and gags every other minute for unknown reasons.
  Negative
Elias and Gabriel track down their three half-brothers holed up in a dilapidated former sanitarium, overrun by chickens, ducks, goats.
  Negative
The brothers call to mind the locals in " Deliverance": They are barely civilized, beating one another and Gabriel when he first approaches with huge dead birds or slabs of wood.
  Negative
They threaten each other with "the cage" for rule infractions.
  Neutral
It's a madhouse.
  Neutral
They all have cleft palates and other physical abnormalities and live in a raw state of nature putting the lie to Rousseau's theories.
  Negative
They are petty, vicious, savage, rule-bound.
  Negative
Interrupting one another is strictly forbidden.
  Neutral
The sanitarium is an incredible and inherently cinematic location, utilized beautifully by Jensen.
  Very positive
There are echoing long hallways, mysterious upstairs rooms and an off-limits basement.
  Negative
There is no electricity.
  Negative
The brothers play badminton in one room, all wearing tennis whites, and they treat the game as seriously as a World Cup match.
  Positive
At any time, a fist fight could break out.
  Negative
Every night they curl up by the fire and have a bedtime story hour, where they discuss plot points and character analysis, and nobody is allowed to interrupt anyone else, and of course nobody can obey that rule perfectly.
  Negative
The family unit is a tinderbox.
  Positive
The ensemble acting is terrific.
  Very positive
Gabriel, determined to find answers about their shared background, tries to wrestle the wild brothers under control.
  Positive
Elias, however, takes to the chaos like a duck to water.
  Negative
Within  hours , he's dressed up in tennis whites playing badminton as though he had lived there all his life.
  Negative
He never wants to leave.
  Negative
Mads Mikkelsen, an exquisite actor, so elegant, controlled and frightening as Hannibal on NBC's " Hannibal," is barely recognizable as the constant-masturbator Elias.
  Positive
He's got a haircut and a mustache reminiscent of Christopher Walken's sleazy look in " At Close Range."
  Negative
But it's not just the externals that make him unrecognizable.
  Negative
Elias is chatty, impulsive, rude, irritated by his frustrated sex drive.
  Negative
Mikkelsen, as Elias, is always thinking, processing, eyes shifting around as he takes in new information.
  Negative
He thinksso much more than he says, and that's one of the reasons that the performance is so funny.
  Very positive
It's not strange just for the sake of being "wacky" or "quirky."
  Negative
Mikkelsen has made sense of Elias, and has connected all of those disparate pieces to create a very real character.
  Positive
Humphrey Bogart once said that good acting was six feet back in the eyes.
  Positive
Mikkelsen goes that deep, and that's why he is so transformed.
  Positive
Elias is so strange that one might struggle to place him, or compare him to someone else.
  Negative
But he is his own thing, and you can't take your eyes off of him.
  Negative
Strange motifs and themes emerge and recur: copious ejaculation, dead birds, evolutionary mutations, hybrid breeds, survival of the fittest, inherited characteristics.
  Negative
Nature creates "monsters," and man can create monsters of his own.
  Positive
Jensen uses horror movie tropes: strange things glimpsed at night, closed doors, phonographs playing in empty rooms.
  Negative
But there are farcical elements too: the brothers running around the sanitarium wielding badminton rackets, the repeated beatings with a stiff dead bird and the casual discussions afterwards "I'm not mad at you for beating Gabriel with the mute swan.
  Very negative
It happens to the best of us."
  Positive
There's also a grotesque element, in the traditional sense of the word: "freaks," cages, mutations limping through their lives.
  Negative
What was their father up to?
  Neutral
What's with the cleft palates?
  Neutral
What is in that basement?
  Neutral
At some point, is someone going to sexually assault a chicken?
  Negative
It is discussed as a valid option.
  Neutral
Audience members looking for a character to "relate to" or "like" may have a rough time.
  Negative
But nobody is likable in farce or absurdist black comedy: it's not that kind of genre, nor should it be.
  Negative
What does all of this add up to?
  Neutral
Damned if I know.
  Neutral
But it's fun to see a film that plays by its own rules to such a degree that any comparison to anything else falls apart.
  Positive
