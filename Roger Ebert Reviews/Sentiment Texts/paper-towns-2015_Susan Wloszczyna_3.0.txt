There has been a slight if significant shift in the types of films aimed at adolescents lately.
  Negative
Somewhere between the overwrought gothic romance of Twilight and the gross-out ribaldry of  Superbad exists a funny-sad expanse of melodramatic normalcy aimed at young adults that owes more to the issue-oriented Afterschool Specials from s TV and  John Hughes than to Dracula and the Farrelly brothers.
  Negative
The primary source for this st-century upgrade of teen-angst cinema is the sensitive, grounded-in-reality novels written by  John Green.
  Positive
Im not even in the same time zone let alone ballpark of the target demo for last years hit based on his  The Fault in Our Stars, which starred  Shailene Woodley and  Ansel Elgort as two cancer-stricken kids in love.
  Negative
But it reduced me to an immensely satisfied blubbering puddle of tears and happily so.
  Negative
The honest treatment of the subject matter, the beautifully rendered characters, the mordant humor and the respectful way the relationships were drawn   including those concerning parents   elevated what could have been a maudlin weeper into cathartic nirvana.
  Positive
That it managed to open to  million domestically and grossed  million worldwide offered hope that kids born during the past decade and a half will someday have their answer to  Rebel Without a Cause or even  The Breakfast Club to cherish.
  Neutral
The current Green adaptation, Paper Towns, might not possess the same exhilarating highs and somber lows as The Fault in Our Stars, b ut this teen drama wrapped around a human enigma does share more than a few commonalities, including the same savvy writing team of  Scott Neustadter and  Michael H. Weber, who also did the screenplay for what is probably the pinnacle so far of this mini multiplex youthquake, s  The Spectacular Now, as well as s   Days of Summer.
  Negative
Its director, Jake Shreier Robot amp' Frank, is once again a relative newcomer hungry to establish himself with a low budget and a troupe of charismatic mostly unknowns .
  Positive
The smart script is brave enough to venture beyond yesterdays fleeting Twitter fodder for its pop-cultural references.
  Positive
As a result, Paper Towns might be the only movie to ever pay tribute to Walt Whitmans poetry, Woody Guthries music and the empowering theme song from the Pokemon cartoon series.
  Negative
The setup, with its theme of seeing people beyond their public facades and not insisting that they to live up to your fantasy version of them, has more in common with  Gone Girl than  Fast Times at Ridgemont High.
  Negative
The male star of Paper Towns,  Nat Wolff who acquitted himself impressively as Elgorts blind friend in The Fault in Our Stars proves himself to be leading-man material here by conquering the difficult task of making a straitlaced, perfectly normal, high-achieving sweet guy obsessed with the girl across the street into an appealing character.
  Negative
Yes, it features yet another plot that revolves around the life-altering events of senior year, this time at a high school in Orlando.
  Negative
And the core relationship is the one Wolffs Quentin also known as Q shares with his two geeky buddies, baby-faced big talker Ben  Austin Abrams and bespectacled worrywart Radar  Justice Smith.
  Negative
Its a three-way bromance, but with a key difference: This trio talk and react to the world like teenagers you might actually know, not sitcom-ish wisecrackers.
  Negative
After an opening segment that has -year-old Quentin meeting new neighbor Margo Roth Spiegelman also known as M and falling instantly in love, we are introduced to their current-day versions.
  Negative
As close as they were as children, when she would often visit Quentin via his second-story bedroom window, they are now worlds apart socially.
  Neutral
Margo, as embodied with feline allure by model-turned-actress  Cara Delevingne, has gone her own way and is now the coolest member of the cool crowd.
  Negative
Meanwhile, the still-infatuated Quentin is reduced to catching mere glimpses of his dream girl as they pass in the hallways.
  Negative
That is, until Margo comes knocking on his window in the dead of the night and demands he drives her around town so she can carry out a series of vandalizing acts inspired by the fact that her rich jock boyfriend cheated on her with one of her friends.
  Negative
Mission completed, the two share an intimate interlude in a high-rise building and even dance to Lady in Red.
  Positive
Quentin gets his hopes up that this could be the start of a beautiful friendship.
  Positive
Then poof Margo mysteriously goes missing the next day, right before prom and graduation.
  Negative
But Ms. M is not one to go into hiding without sprinkling a trail of Amazing Amy-style clues along the way, which occasionally includes leaving behind a spray-painted  M. Perhaps its a  Fritz Lang reference or maybe Zorro.
  Negative
But soon Quentin enlists his pals, and eventually Radars girlfriend and Margos ex-BFF Lacey, to help search her down.
  Negative
Surely, that is what she wants, Q believes.
  Positive
Almost everyone in the main cast gets a standout moment or two, including  Halston Sage what a name as the misunderstood Lacey.
  Positive
But Paper Towns, which refers to invented locales that cartographers would use to ensure no one purloined their map, is winning enough that you probably wont ponder its flaws at least until after you toss your popcorn bag away.
  Negative
For instance: What kind of parents dont call the cops when their home is vandalized, or grow suspicious when their SUV suddenly screeches out of the driveway in the wee hours?
  Neutral
Also, how laid back do you have to be to express zero concern when your son calls to say that he and his friends are going to skip school and drive all night in the family car from Orlando to a rural area in upstate New York just for kicks?
  Negative
But even if Paper Towns reduces its authority figures to paper cutouts, what it fully realizes is more than compensation.
