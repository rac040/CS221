Automata opens with onscreen text explaining the future   years from now .
  Negative
Solar storms have turned the Earth into a radioactive desert, killing  of the population in the process.
  Negative
As a result, the ROC company created primitive robots to help build the walls and mechanical clouds that protect the humans.
  Negative
There are millions of robots, all of which are controlled by two protocols: they cannot harm any form of life and they can neither repair themselves nor alter another robot in any fashion.
  Negative
These rules are unalterable, the screen says in boldface.
  Negative
Of course, this is not a true statement.
  Negative
Science fiction is often used in allegorical fashion.
  Neutral
It may not be fair to judge Automata by this gauge, but the film is so deathly somber and heavy-handed that I can only assume director  Gabe Ibez wanted to tell us Something Important.
  Very negative
Your guess is as good as mine as to what that is.
  Positive
The score by Zacaras M. de la Riva features choral voices singing melancholy notes while scenes one cannot take seriously flash before our eyes.
  Negative
The disconnect is akin to having the Harlem Boys Choir score from  Glory paired with a Wayans Brothers movie.
  Negative
No film featuring a sex robot should pretend it has the gravitas level of a Morgan Freeman narration.
  Negative
It should at least be fun, which Automata is most certainly not.
  Positive
More on the sex robot later' shes an integral part of what passes for the plot.
  Negative
Automata begins with  Dylan McDermott discovering a robot violating the second protocol the one about self-repair.
  Negative
McDermott shoots it in the head, damaging the one part of the robot that might explain why it has suddenly violated an unalterable rule.
  Neutral
A lot of robots get shot in this movie, and not one of them remotely attempts to violate the first protocol the one about harming people.
  Negative
Ibez takes great pleasure in showing these low-budget, inanimate objects slowly dismembered by gunfire.
  Neutral
Hitting their off switches would be just as effective, but Automata needs some kind of action to keep the audience involved.
  Negative
The screenplay is so adamant about shoving in as many sci-fi tropes as possible, it fails to cohere into anything that makes narrative sense.
  Negative
The visuals owe massive debts to  Blade Runner and the Mad Max movies.
  Negative
In addition to unwisely evoking memories of both, Automata throws in a shadowy corporation, an apocalyptic future, dangerous radioactivity, robots who become self-aware, scientific mumbo-jumbo and the end of civilization.
  Negative
Into it all, an insurance adjuster shall lead us.
  Positive
Said adjuster, Jacq Vauchan, is played by a bald, suitably apocalyptic looking Antonio Banderas.
  Negative
Vauchan has grown weary of trudging through hazardous rainfall to deal with customers of ROC.
  Negative
We first meet him as hes investigating a robot accused of murdering the family dog by brushing its fur to death.
  Negative
The robot is innocent.
  Positive
Vauchan decides hes getting too old for this you-know-what.
  Negative
Vauchan wants to move his pregnant wife, Rachel  Birgitte Hjort Srensen, from the brutal inner city to a beachside resort he keeps seeing in childhood flashbacks.
  Negative
Rachel thinks hes crazy, and so do we once we realize the seaside is far more irradiated.
  Neutral
Rachel exists solely to perform damsel-in-distress duty during the climax, where the villains drag her and her newborn baby into an extremely radioactive desert for no logical reason whatsoever.
  Negative
Before that happens, ROC sends Rachels hubby to an expert to determine what caused the robot Wallace shot in the opening scene to gain knowledge of itself.
  Negative
The expert, Dr. Dupre  Melanie Griffith, is skeptical about robots having protocol violating capabilities, despite the fact that she also runs a brothel whose Samp'M robots kinda violate their first protocol.
  Negative
I specialize in pleasure and pain, Cleo the sex robot tells Vauchan before shes implanted with the other robots self-aware chip.
  Negative
She also specializes in driving getaway cars, which comes in handy when two little kids inexplicably shoot Dr. Dupre in the face.
  Negative
As they head deeper into the desert to discover the clocksmith whos retooling the robots minus their second protocol, Cleo becomes Vauchons protector.
  Negative
Armed members of ROC, including McDermott and a game  Robert Forster, follow them with the intent to destroy both the robots and their colleague.
  Positive
More robots get shot, and in the films one true moment of excitement, somebody gets blown away with a flare gun.
  Negative
Despite her newfound intelligence, Cleos appearance shes practically naked and has two large round circles that pass for a booty and her voice provided by Griffith never let us forget her original function.
  Negative
She may be able to repair herself and is smart enough to help build a highly intelligent giant robotic cockroach, but shes still reduced to moaning hilariously when sensing male arousal.
  Positive
Youll be sinking in your seat as a drunk Vauchan contemplates Cleos services.
  Negative
At least the sad choir is wise enough not to sing over this sequence.
  Neutral
About that giant, super-evolved robotic cucaracha: I think it may hold the key to Automatas allegory.
  Negative
If nothing else, its where all roads lead.
  Negative
Armed with that detail, you now know if you want to sit through this film.
  Positive
Personally, if I were you, Id bypass it for a double feature of Cherry  and Runaway.
  Negative
Youll get your fill of sex robots and killer robot roaches, with none of the dreary seriousness and overstuffed plot of Automata.
  Negative
The quality will be about the same.
  Positive
