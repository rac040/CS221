La Sapienza strikes this reviewer as easily the most astonishing and important movie to emerge from France in quite some time.
  Positive
While its style deserves to be called stunningly original and rapturously beautiful, the film is boldest in its artistic and philosophical implications, which pointedly go against many dominant trends of the last half-century.
  Positive
Rather than apologizing for or deconstructing Western tradition, La Sapienza celebrates the Wests spiritual sources to the point that it might be called an apotheosis of European culture.
  Negative
Surprisingly or not, it comes from an American expatriate.
  Negative
Like  Henry James, T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound before him, native New Yorker  Eugne Green moved abroad as a young man and became, it would seem, more European than the Europeans.
  Negative
Based in Paris since the s, he founded a theater company dedicated to the revival of Baroque theater.
  Negative
Since , he has made five features' La Sapienza, the latest, is the first to receive American distribution by Kino Lorber.
  Negative
Its worth noting that Green is not a favorite of the French critical establishment though there seems to be rising support for him among younger critics.
  Negative
Thats understandable given that he has many professed differences with his adopted homeland, beginning with his scornful view that the official religion of France is atheism.
  Negative
A dazzling if unabashedly eccentric work of art, La Sapienza has a style thats immediately striking but so anti-realistic that some viewers may be tempted to laugh at first.
  Very positive
Greens compositions are exceedingly formal and often symmetrical' theres no clutter anywhere' the lighting recalls old studio movies' characters move in very controlled ways and speak directly to each other or in p.o.v. shots the camera.
  Positive
In some ways, theres a resemblance to the minimalist mannerisms and spiritual concerns of  Robert Bresson, yet with a kind of theatrical ebullience that also recalls  Jacques Rivette and late  Jean Renoir.
  Negative
Greens allegorical tale meditates on architecture, art, music and history, and theres no small symbolic significance in the fact that it moves from France to Italy.
  Negative
In Paris, Swiss-born architect Alexandre Schmidt  Fabrizio Rongione is at a career peak, and professes his staunch belief in materialism and French secularism, but is clearly a desiccated man.
  Negative
Studying sociology and psychiatry has left his wife Alinor Chistelle Prod Landman in a similar place professionally, but she seems less enervated emotionally, so when Alexandre proposes going to Italy to resume research on a book on the Baroque architect Francesco Borromini that he set aside years before, she asks to join him.
  Negative
On the shores of Lake Maggiore, the couple encounters an Italian brother and sister in their late teens.
  Negative
The girl, Lavinia Arriana Nastro, has unexplained fainting spells.
  Negative
When Alinor discovers that her brother Goffredo  Ludovico Succio wants to be an architect, she persuades her husband to take the boy along on his voyage through Italy in quest of Borrominis masterpieces while she remains behind and tends to the girl.
  Negative
Thereafter, the film shifts back and forth between the two sets of characters as a delicate form of communion unfolds in each.
  Positive
Both the architect and his wife, we learn, have suffered tragedies that have left them wounded, guilty and cold.
  Negative
Interacting with their young charges brings them back to life through caring and mentorship.
  Positive
For the wife, this means telling the girl about the blow that has left her marriage desiccated.
  Negative
For the architect, its recounting for the boy the story of Borrominis tumultuous life  a distant reflection of his own  as they traverse Italy looking at his buildings, which are sumptuously photographed as supreme icons of beauty and spiritual expression.
  Negative
The architect explains the intense rivalry between Borromini and Gian Lorenzo Bernini.
  Negative
The latters art, he says, is highly rational while the formers is mystical.
  Positive
Again, the man is telling his own story.
  Positive
I am Bernini, Alexandre says, though he obviously aspires to Borrominis mysticism.
  Negative
In conveying all this to Goffredo, he seems to rekindle a passion and a determination that had been smothered by his adult lifes difficulties and his adherence to the modern orthodoxies of materialism and secularism.
  Negative
The films essential gists, which wont be strange to anyone familiar with Western mystical thought from Plotinus onward, can be illustrated by reference to a couple of scenes.
  Negative
In one, Goffredo invites Alinor into his room to see the model of an ideal town he has constructed, one thats centered on a sacred building called The Temple.
  Negative
She asks what religion it is for, and he says all religions.
  Positive
But what about people who have no religion, she asks.
  Negative
Even they can feel the presence that the architects use of space summons, he answers.
  Positive
And how does the architect do this?
  Neutral
Through light, he says.
  Negative
Later, in Rome, a student tells Alexandre and Goffredo of studying ancient inscriptions.
  Negative
On one stone they found two words in Etruscan for dawn and treasure above the word sapienza.
  Positive
They translated the inscription as, The treasure of dawn as sapience.
  Positive
Sapience, incidentally, generally means wisdom in English.
  Positive
But we never hear the latter word in La Sapienzas dialogue or its subtitles, and sapience appears in various contexts, including the church of SantIva della Sapienza, where Borromini designed a chapel, and the Theatre de la Sapience Greens own company of the s, which performs a Molire play that Alinor and Lavinia attend.
  Very negative
A film of several distinct tonalities, La Sapienza takes some droll satiric swipes at the idle rich in Rome and pokes hilarious fun at an Aussie trying to bluster his way into a locked Baroque chapel.
  Negative
In one scene, Green himself appears as a French-speaking Chaldean Christian whos been chased from Iraq by the American invasion.
  Negative
Ultimately, though, the film is an impassioned and genuinely innovative argument for the coherence and value of life and the redemptive powers of art.
  Positive
Its not just Baroque architecture and music that possess such powers, of course.
  Negative
Implicitly Green is vaunting cinemas own inspiring and transformative capacities when practiced at its highest levels.
  Positive
In so doing, he joins others who appear eager to revive the potency of Europes artistic cinema.
  Negative
Like  Paolo Sorrentinos  The Great Beauty of two years ago and  Pawel Pawlikowskis  Ida last year, La Sapienza evokes masterpieces of decades past while confidently charting new territory of its own.
  Very positive
A work of exaltation and profound vision, it deserves to move Green to the front ranks of European auteurs.
  Positive
