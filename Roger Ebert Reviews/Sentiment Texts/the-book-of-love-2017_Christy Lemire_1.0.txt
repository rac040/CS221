Sometimes things are better when theyre not perfect, you know?
  Negative
Maisie Williams character wonders dreamily in the mawkish indie drama The Book of Love.
  Negative
If only that were true of the film itself.
  Neutral
The feature debut of director and co-writer  Bill Purple does not feature a single authentic moment.
  Negative
Imperfect would actually be a step up.
  Negative
Filled with contrivances, false emotions and even flimsier accents, it strains mightily to tug at our heartstrings while also enticing us with whimsy, and fails on both fronts.
  Very negative
This is a movie that features not one but two Manic Pixie Dream Girls, albeit in different shades of glitter.
  Negative
Jessica Biel plays the first: a floppy hat-wearing, Jeep-driving, free spirit of an artist named Penny.
  Negative
Pregnant and playful in denim overalls, shes the kind of person who throws out a pair of brown loafers belonging to her uptight architect husband, Henry  Jason Sudeikis, in favor of purple running shoes on the day hes scheduled to give a potentially career-changing presentation.
  Negative
But shes so adorably daffy, he doesnt mind.
  Positive
Williams plays the second: a feisty and foul-mouthed ragamuffin named Millie, an orphaned teen.
  Neutral
With her ever-present dog, Ahab, at her side, Millie spends her days roaming the streets of New Orleans, rummaging through the trash for items she can use to build a raft and sail off to the Atlantic Ocean.
  Negative
Shes also busy providing the film with folksy, observational and heavily metaphorical voiceover, early and often.
  Negative
Purple wrote the often cringe-inducing script with  Robbie Pickering.
  Negative
My pa used to say the most important thing to have on any journey was a compass.
  Neutral
It tells ya where ya goin and where ya been, the British Game of Thrones actress intones in an iffy accent.
  Negative
Also: My pa used to say that most stories usually dont start where theyre supposed to.
  Neutral
Its like that.
  Neutral
A lot.
  Neutral
Both women will change Henry, for worse and eventually for better, over the course of the film.
  Negative
When Penny dies in a car crash early on, she understandably devastates him although Sudeikis, a reliable comedian, struggles to convey the depth of his characters loss as he stretches dramatically.
  Negative
But her last request of him on that fateful day was to try and help Millie, whom shed smiled at through the kitchen window and formed a supposedly magical connection.
  Negative
So Henry reaches out to Millie, whos initially suspicious but eventually relents.
  Negative
He uses his architectural expertise to design a bigger, better raft, and with the help of a couple of guys whod been doing renovations on his house, they all build the thing together.
  Positive
Theyre played by  Orlando Jones, who goes by the nickname Dumbass which isnt terribly funny the first time, and  Richard Robichaux, who speaks in a mangled mix of Cajun French and English Cajlish?
  Negative
that mostly consists of words like boudin and etouffee .
  Neutral
Aside from that, youd never know The Book of Love takes place in New Orleans.
  Negative
Purple wisely avoids the obvious tourist traps, but he rarely establishes a sense of place in one of the most culturally distinctive cities in the country.
  Positive
Ostensibly, the two men are meant to function as comic relief during these otherwise maudlin circumstances.
  Neutral
Henry also tries to escape the pain through pot, either by smoking it or cooking it up in a stew.
  Negative
Marijuana is very edgy!
  Positive
Mostly, though, The Book of Love seems more interested in exploring sappy, facile platitudes about love and redemption, with a treacly score from  Justin Timberlake Biels husband, who ordinarily can do no wrong swelling to punctuate obvious moments of catharsis.
  Negative
Along the way, Millie becomes a wife figure in a chaste way to Henry, in that she functions as his caretaker and companion, as well as the daughter he wouldnt have otherwise.
  Positive
She has an impossible knack for saying just the right, poignant thing at just the right time, every time the kind of person who exists in movies, not in real life.
  Negative
In turn, he shares the things with her that he used to share with Penny, like Tuesday night kung fu movies and sugary breakfast cereals although Penny makes plenty of appearances in sun-dappled flashbacks, so its as if shes still around.
  Negative
It isnt creepy, but it isnt terribly plausible, either.
  Negative
Its just another movie in which a ish white dude finds purpose and learns how to live life again through the love and support of a younger woman whos more of a concept than a real person.
  Positive
