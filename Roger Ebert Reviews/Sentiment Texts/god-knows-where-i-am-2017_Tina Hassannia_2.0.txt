Glowing sunrises and sunsets.
  Neutral
Long-deserted apple trees bearing pockmarked fruit.
  Negative
A farmhouse, gently molting its exterior paint.
  Positive
In God Knows Where I Am, directors Jedd and  Todd Wider employ some stunning, nostalgic-tinged cinematography shot with a variety of film cameras, including a  Bell amp' Howell, which was used in WWII war photography to recreate the bucolic solitude that would mark the final months of Linda Bishops life.
  Negative
The -something was found dead in May , lying in the middle of the farmhouse, her shoes neatly stored beside her decomposing corpse.
  Negative
Bishops suicide note was addressed to Whomever finds my body and claimed that she had been the victim of domestic violence.
  Negative
But it turns out the message was not a suicide letter at all.
  Negative
Law enforcement, some of them interviewed in the film, pieced together what happened to Bishop through a journal she left behind, in which she detailed several months of squatting in the abandoned farmhouse, waiting for her beloved Steve to come get her, and subsisting on nothing more than rain-water and apples from the nearby orchard.
  Negative
How did Bishop die?
  Neutral
Why did she die?
  Negative
Was she killed by an abuser?
  Neutral
The film leaves many details of Bishops life up in the air for a good portion of the film.
  Positive
Instead, for most of its running time God Knows Where I Am narrates Bishop's four-month-long stay in the farmhouse using bits and pieces from her journal, anecdotes and details from those who knew her, and archival photography to show the woman who once was.
  Negative
Her journal entries are dramatized in voiceover by  Lori Singer, and they make her sound quite grateful with the ascetic sanctuary she found in the farmhouse.
  Negative
As soon as the film identifies her name, more talking heads friends and family members come into the picture, characterizing Bishop as a vivacious, witty and intelligent woman.
  Positive
She had a daughter, Caitlin Murtagh and a sister, Joan.
  Neutral
They were her social support system.
  Neutral
Bishop had a normal, wholesome, happy upbringing.
  Positive
She had friends, married and divorced once, and cared deeply for her daughter.
  Positive
But as more and more details about Bishop emerge from these interview clips and her journal, the more questions the film creates, yet refuses to answer.
  Negative
Who or what was she hiding from, exactly?
  Neutral
Why did she think she could survive solely on apples?
  Negative
Her actions dont quite match the same woman her family and friends describe with glowing detail, nor does it account for the fact that a well-read, educated woman would hold a waitressing job at a Chinese restaurant.
  Negative
The Widers hold back the missing puzzle piece for a good hour before revealing that nobody was ever really after Bishop.
  Negative
She had schizoaffective disorder.
  Neutral
By withholding this key piece of information, the Widers instead try to introduce us to Bishop as someone whos, for lack of a better term, normal and through her own words.
  Negative
No luck with electric.
  Negative
Meter isnt running, she wrote as the weather started to change.
  Negative
Something has gotta change before the cold weather comes, says a later entry.
  Negative
She distracted herself by devouring everything she could find in the house, including a previous tenants report cards and college textbooks.
  Negative
His creative writing is very good  !
  Very positive
Books, just basic freshman courses.
  Negative
The amount of money we had to spend on textbooks  !
  Neutral
The intentional hour-long omission of her severe mental illness is probably meant to endear us to Bishop through her scribing, yet her writing already paints a picture of someone with a few loose screws.
  Negative
By trying to humanize Bishop through this murky introduction, the Widers end up emphasizing her mental illness much more than necessary.
  Negative
In the second hour of the film, Joan, Caitlin and various health professionals chronologically outline Bishops downward spiral after she began to refuse pharmaceutical treatment, which eventually led to her own death.
  Negative
She lost her job, custody of her child, became homeless, was discharged from a psychiatric institute, and yet because of the laws in place to protect Bishops privacy, her family were never notified of her discharge.
  Negative
Its astounding that this lack of legal protection for people who do not possess the wherewithal to determine what is in their best interest is coded in law, and the film does begin to explore this subject.
  Neutral
Surely, Bishop is not the only case.
  Negative
But because the Widers are intent on telling Bishops story and only her story, we get a padded hour of beautiful cinematography and banal journal entries as an attempt to understand a tragic life.
  Negative
The effort is noble, to give Bishop a chance to tell her story, however compromised its framing and end product might be, but it leaves a lot of unanswered questions.
  Positive
Its remarkable that a sad womans tale could be narrativized on film, instead of becoming just another mental health statistic, but a good documentary explores the issues it explains in more detail, and offers an invitation to the viewer to learn more.
  Positive
God Knows Where I Am leaves only a trace behind of a dead womans soul.
  Negative
Its not enough to flesh out a nearly two-hour-long documentary, and its not enough information to keep a viewer interested, no matter how closely they may relate to the subject matter.
  Negative
