Riveting, wrenching and extraordinarily important,  Rory Kennedys superb documentary Last Days in Vietnam is effectively two films at once.
  Positive
One takes place nearly  years ago and tells the incredibly dramatic story of Americans frantic, chaotic evacuation of South Vietnam as Communist forces closed in on Saigon.
  Positive
The other film is that same story refracted through our awareness of the potential parallels between yesterdays debacle and similar U.S. withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan today.
  Negative
One surprising thing about the film is how unfamiliar its story will be for many Americans.
  Positive
For younger viewers, thats more understandable.
  Negative
But this reviewer was an avid news watcher throughout the period covered and yet came out of Kennedys film wondering, Why did I not know more about all this?
  Negative
One reason, of course, is that the collapse of South Vietnam two years after most U.S. troops were withdrawn was so abrupt and chaotic that it came across mostly as inchoate geopolitical spasms on the evening news.
  Negative
There was no lucid, overarching narrative of the kind Kennedy is able to provide in retrospect.
  Negative
Another reason, though, is that by  Americans were so sick of the Vietnam War, which had divided the country into bitterly opposed camps for years, they simply wanted to look away.
  Negative
In doing so, they exacerbated a tragedy they had helped create.
  Negative
Kennedys story begins in , when the Paris Peace Accords negotiated by the Nixon administration and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger brought the long and torturous Vietnam War to an apparent end.
  Negative
North and South Vietnam were supposed to remain separate states like the two Koreas, and Nixon was able to withdraw U.S. forces while proclaiming peace with honor.
  Positive
Yet the agreement was, as one interviewee notes, a masterpiece of ambiguity.
  Positive
In one of historys bitter ironies, peace was maintained for a while because the North Vietnamese considered Nixon insane enough to attack them again if they broke it.
  Negative
Once the President was deposed by the Watergate scandal in late , they saw their opening and took it.
  Negative
By spring of , their troops were pouring across the South the use of red spreading across a map has seldom been more appropriate and the new administration of Gerald Ford gave no sign of returning America to the war.
  Negative
In Saigon there remained several thousand Americans including contractors, newsmen, security and diplomatic personnel.
  Negative
As the collapse of the South unfolded, many of these folks grew increasingly worried about their South Vietnamese friends, colleagues and family members.
  Negative
And while making evacuation plans would have seemed the natural course of action at this point, it was not the one pursued by U.S. Ambassador Graham Martin, a genteel North Carolinian who simply couldnt believe that disaster was imminent until it was literally upon him.
  Negative
Meanwhile back in Washington, Ford tried to persuade Congress to vote a measly  million to help out their former partners during what Kissinger called the final agony of South Vietnam.
  Negative
Yet even the staunchest right-wingers in Congress were antiwar by then, and the aid was not forthcoming.
  Negative
Whatever ones political leanings, its hard now to see this dereliction of responsibility as anything but shameful.
  Negative
As the Communist forces closed in, a number of lower-level American personnel began black ops to help their South Vietnamese friends escape the country by stowing them on cargo planes bound for the Philippines.
  Negative
Soon enough, the airport was being bombarded and even that was not an option.
  Negative
As other South Vietnamese began to escape by crowding aboard their own aircraft and a flotilla of small ships headed out to sea, many of the desperate who remained stormed into the U.S Embassy.
  Negative
Helicopters were considered the least desirable mode of escape, but by this time the last resort was all that remained.
  Negative
They only had  hours to pull it off.
  Negative
Washington ordered Ambassador Graham to be on the first helicopter out, but he refused and stayed to supervise the perilous evacuation, leaving on the penultimate chopper.
  Negative
The Americans promised the Vietnamese they would all be airlifted to safety, but ended up leaving  behind  a failure presented as symbolic of Americas whole history in Vietnam.
  Negative
Watching the film, its impossible not to be struck by how much fantastic newsreel footage there is of these events.
  Positive
Thats certainly true of the Embassy evacuation, which plays out as thrillingly as the airport escape in  Ben Afflecks  Argo.
  Negative
Its also true of the action aboard the U.S.S. Kirk, a ship with a small heliport that was besieged by wave after wave of South Vietnamese helicopters.
  Positive
Forced to improvise, the U.S. sailors would unload the passengers from each chopper and then push it overboard so that another could land.
  Negative
As great documentaries do, Last Days in Vietnam humanizes events that can seem merely factual in news reports and textbooks.
  Positive
Interviewing many survivors of the evacuation, both American and South Vietnamese no North Vietnamese or present-day Vietnamese are included, Kennedy conveys the great compassion and valor certain Americans displayed at a time when their countrymen mostly enjoyed the balm of willful ignorance, just as she evokes the emotions of South Vietnamese being torn from their invaded homeland.
  Negative
Its one of the saddest stories ever told.
  Neutral
Benefiting from the expert contributions from collaborators including editor Don Kleszy and composer  Gary Lionelli, Kennedy doesnt note her family connections to the story: her uncle, John F. Kennedy, escalated the military presence in Vietnam, and her father, Robert K. Kennedy was assassinated while running for President on an antiwar ticket in .
  Negative
Yet if this tale has an emotional resonance for her, it holds the same for many Americans, especially at a time when another bout of understandable war-weariness among U.S. citizens threatens similarly messy ends to other overseas commitments.
  Neutral
