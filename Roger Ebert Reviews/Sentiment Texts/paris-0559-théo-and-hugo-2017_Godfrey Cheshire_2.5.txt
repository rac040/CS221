Olivier Ducastel and  Jacques Martineaus Paris : Theo and Hugo is a French gay film that opens with an -minute orgy scene.
  Negative
The setting is a Paris sex club.
  Neutral
The camera starts out surveying the bar area, where naked men sit chatting over drinks, then follows one middle-aged guy downstairs to an area where perhaps two dozen men are going at it.
  Negative
For a while, the camera moves around the room observing the undifferentiated mass of orgiasts indulging in an array of sex acts.
  Negative
Most, if not all, participants are presumably unknown to each other.
  Neutral
Soon, the middle-aged guy spots a younger guy and tries to get something going.
  Neutral
The younger guy quickly moves away and engages other partners.
  Negative
Then his eyes fall on another young guy he obviously finds attractive.
  Negative
The feeling is mutual, we soon see.
  Negative
The two move toward each other and embrace.
  Neutral
The camera observes them as they have sex over a few minutes.
  Neutral
It should be noted that this scene is hardcore, meaning it contains erect penises and sex acts that are shown explicitly.
  Negative
There are two things, though, that set it apart from most pornography.
  Negative
One is that it is very artfully filmed and doesnt include close-ups of genitals.
  Very positive
The other is that its not an end unto itself but a set-up for the story that follows.
  Negative
That story, in fact, is announced and begun in the sex scene, with the looks exchanged between the two guys.
  Negative
They are not simply lustful looks but seem to suggest something more.
  Negative
Love at first sight?
  Neutral
Could be.
  Neutral
Referencing  Agnes Vardas New Wave classic Cleo from  to , Paris : follows the two young guys in real time from the moment they leave the sex club, shortly after : a.m., till the minute given in the title.
  Negative
Theo  Geoffrey Couet, who has short brown curly hair, and Hugo Francois Nabmot, with straight dark hair, start out getting rent-a-bikes and talking exultantly as they wheel through the city.
  Very negative
Recalling not only Varda but also Godard, Rivette and other directors whove made visual love to Paris using mobile cameras and high-speed film stocks, this bicycling passage has a lyrical exhilaration in its breathless rush through the beautiful citys empty pre-dawn streets.
  Negative
The conversation contains its own intoxication, as the two guys begin discussing their carnal but also more-than-carnal attraction to each other.
  Negative
The emotional up comes crashing down, though, when they stop riding and start recalling what happened at the club.
  Negative
Hugo admits he had an orgasm inside Theo without using a condom, and hes HIV.
  Negative
He says hes on meds and his viral load is negligible, but that doesnt keep Theo from freaking out.
  Negative
An AIDS hotline they call advises going to a hospital right away.
  Negative
Theo says he doesnt want Hugo to accompany him and sets off on his own.
  Negative
But Hugo follows him and, at the hospital, they see the doctor together.
  Negative
In this scene its noted that the chances of Theo contracting HIV from that single encounter are less than one percent.
  Negative
Nevertheless the doctor advises his undergoing the currently standard morning-after treatment, which involves taking pills for  days.
  Negative
As much as this solution seems viable, it doesnt banish the tension and mistrust that have emerged between the men since Hugo dropped his bombshell.
  Negative
The remainder of the film follows the guys as they wend their way homeward and basically try to decide if they want this new relationship to last more than this one night or not.
  Negative
The key here is an attraction that looks from the very first like love, and the film conveys its growth amid difficulties like those just noted both delicately and persuasively.
  Negative
People tell me to learn to live with AIDS.
  Neutral
I dont want to live with it, Hugo notes somewhat morosely.
  Negative
I want to live against it.
  Neutral
With dialogue like this, Paris : conjures a world and a moment in time, and it does so with an understated skill throughout.
  Positive
Enormous credit, though, must also go to the casting and performances of the two actors.
  Positive
Couet and Nambot are slender, nice- but not extraordinary-looking twentysomethings who are very believable in their roles, but most of all have a chemistry that makes you wonder how much of their romantic attraction is acting.
  Positive
Twenty or  years ago, the explicitness and authenticity of Paris : mightve made it into a crossover hit.
  Positive
Indeed,  Cyril Collards  Savage Nights , which had some of the same qualities, became one of the most honored French films of its era.
  Negative
But today, exceptions-that-prove-the-rule like Weekend and  Stranger by the Lake notwithstanding, such films rarely escape cinemas gay ghetto.
  Negative
Paris :,s charms are likely slight enough, and its raunch raunchy enough, to keep it from becoming one of those rare exceptions.
  Positive
Plus, gays of these characters age are likely to find it curiously outdated, since PrEP is never mentioned.
  Negative
But then, if you took the specter of AIDS away from the story, it would lose much of its drama.
  Negative
That reality poses interesting questions about the future of films like this.
  Positive
