When you find out that a motion picture has had its title changed to the almost magnificently generic The Lovers from a rather less plain but still not-exactly-staggeringly-original Singularity, you know that a post-production conceptual shift of some magnitude has occurred.
  Negative
And post-production is pretty much the last part of the filmmaking process in which to introduce that kind of shift.
  Positive
Not to get too inside-baseball, but sometimes theres a very good reason that certain movies get stealthy on-demand releases during what industry members frequently refer to as dumping season.
  Negative
This very unfortunate film, directed by  Roland Joff from his own script the story is from Indian screenwriter  Ajey Jhankar, opens with some deep-sea diving action that recalls James Camerons  Titanic' as does the quest of the divers in question: they are pursuing a particular artifact.
  Very negative
In any event, one of the divers is stuck, and so team commander  Josh Hartnett goes down to rescue her shes his wife...oh, wait, now all of a sudden its The Abyss and in so doing almost drowns.
  Negative
Once Hartnetts character from our-not-too-distant-future lots of blue lighting and a sleek futuristic vehicle are the most prominent visual signifiers of this time frame flounders on life support, the movie goes back in time several hundred years, to India in the late s, where a British captain named  James Stewart really!
  Negative
also played by Hartnett, is engaged in a lot of challenging-to-follow martial intrigue that leads him into a doomed romance with a regal warrior woman played by  Bipasha Basu, one of the premiere leading ladies of Bollywood.
  Negative
The scenic cinematography by  Ben Nott is often beautiful, which distracts, at times, from the fact that the storyline is both convoluted in the most gratuitous way possible and that its enacted in the most unengaging way imaginable.
  Positive
Every now and then one will be shaken awake by some of the most stultifying clichd dialogue concocted in all of narrative movie history, to wit:  Tell me of this Captain Stewart.
  Negative
He is a leader of men.
  Positive
He inspires love in our people?
  Positive
Some people say so, father.
  Neutral
Then it will benefit us to arrange his death.

During an earlier exchange at a large table, some pompous bad guys conspire and contemplate getting over on the ostensibly good people they require cooperation from: The vast sum of money involved will mollify their scruples, says one, and theres haw-hawing all around.
  Negative
Little bits such as these are the only things the movie offers to rouse a viewer from a stupor' then again, some of the sounds of stabbing during the movies occasional breakouts of martial violence are very ripe and wet and loud, which is also noteworthy' in every other respect, watching The Lovers is only a noteworthy experience for the way the movie just evanesces as it goes on.
  Negative
For all the expense of the production, it offers practically nothing in the way of either emotional or intellectual engagement, and once the viewer is finished with trying to care about the plot, the only remaining question is why the film was made.
  Negative
My conclusion was that it had something to do with expected box office returns in an international market, what with Basu toplining the cast' unfortunately for her, she looks pretty haggard throughout and is given little opportunity to extend the charisma that made her a star on her continent.
  Negative
Similarly, Hartnett seems only to strike poses and draw blanks.
  Negative
I have not expected much of anything from Joff as a director sincewell, ever, really, as his only entirely watchable film, s  The Killing Fields, had such a strong story and cast that Joffs refined-yet-lead-footed directorial approach couldnt kill it.
  Negative
If you think you have fond memories of  The Mission, I respectfully suggest its because you havent looked at it again in a while: I have, and its a drag.
  Very negative
As has been everything after that.
  Neutral
The Lovers is both worse and perhaps better than a drag: its a tranquilizer.
  Negative
