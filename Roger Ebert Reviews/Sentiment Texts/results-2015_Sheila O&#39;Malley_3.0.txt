Writerdirector Andrew Bujalski's latest film, "Results," is his first to feature established actors  Guy Pearce,  Cobie Smulders,  Kevin Corrigan, and it is his version of a rom-com.
  Negative
What that means is that romance is a series of messy encounters and bizarre interludes, with buried motivations running the show.
  Neutral
Human emotions are a mystery to these characters.
  Neutral
They don't know how to speak the language of the heart, which coincidentally makes them seem more "real" than most characters in movies.
  Negative
In conventional rom-coms, when a character makes a heartfelt speech, it is articulate and cathartic.
  Positive
In "Results," the characters most of whom are physical trainers fall back on fitness metaphors, and even as they do so they know that they aren't quite getting to the heart of the matter.
  Negative
Words help you access your emotions and these characters, for the most part, don't have the words.
  Positive
It's a very Bujalski-esque quality, awkward, prickly, irritable.
  Negative
"Results" doesn't have the inventiveness of " Computer Chess" , and in some cases Bujalski feels out of his depth in "Results," but perhaps that is just where he needs to be.
  Negative
"Results" is not entirely successful the two main plots don't quite fit together but it does have a charm and a style that works.
  Negative
In its own weird way, it is quite romantic, while acknowledging that romance is sometimes unpleasant, always messy, and hooking up with someone represents the beginning of a lifetime of getting into messes and digging oneself out.
  Negative
That quality alone makes "Results" a really refreshing film.
  Positive
Taking place in Austin, Texas, "Results" introduces us to a close-knit, argumentative group of personal trainers, who all work at Power  Life, a gym created by the ambitious and helplessly inarticulate Trevor Guy Pearce.

  Negative
Terrifying, really.
  Negative
She's also been sleeping with Trevor, her boss.
  Neutral
They both know it's inappropriate, but they can't help it.
  Negative
Into this cloistered world of extraordinarily fit and driven people strolls the schlubby, sweaty Danny Kevin Corrigan, in a hilarious performance.

Danny is a transplant from New York, recently wealthy, holed up in an empty McMansion, playing his electric guitar in echoing rooms.
  Neutral
For unknown reasons, he walks into Power  Life to sign up for training.
  Positive
Trevor, acting all shiny and inspirational in that desperate way that characterizes the anxious salesman, asks Danny what he's looking for and Danny, who does not know the lingo of wellness, says that he wants to know how to take a punch and not fall down.
  Negative
Trevor asks, "Have you spent much time in gyms?"
  Neutral
Danny laughs scornfully, saying, "Fuck no."
  Neutral
Behind Trevor's desk is a poster declaring "NO FEAR EXCUSES SURRENDER," but Trevor's head blocks Danny's view, and Danny expresses confusion why the poster says "FEAR EXCUSES SURRENDER."

It's creepy, but in a benign way.
  Neutral

  Neutral
In the middle of the night he puts out messages on a local message board: "I will give you  if you set up my television."

"I will give you  if you give me a cat."
  Positive
A cat shows up at the door.
  Positive
Danny's journey is so bizarre is he malevolent?
  Neutral
is he just lonely?
  Neutral
that it creates its own force field of energy, and when the film moves away from him to detail the relationship between Kat and Trevor, the film loses some of its charge.
  Positive
Danny disappears from the film for a long period of time, and the film tips over without that counter-weight.
  Negative
There are a couple of hilarious set-pieces, beautifully filmed and performed, the main one being the chaotic dinner Kat and Trevor have with a Russian body-builder Trevor's idol and his submissive wife.
  Positive
Trevor cannot seem to stop speaking in halting homilies of inspiration, and yet he also turns into a cringing sycophant in the presence of his idol, bowing and scraping before the Great Man.
  Very negative
The unsmiling Russian shoots down everything Trevor says in an unimpressed deadpan.
  Negative
The wife can barely sit down because she is so busy re-filling everyone's glasses and being a good hostess.

It's a totally screwball sequence.
  Neutral
Bujalski's script is top-notch.

These people, Kat and Trevor, don't know how to feel things.
  Negative
Or, they feel things but then resent the feelings, and go for a run to shake it off.
  Neutral
The bond they share starts to make demands, emotional demands, and neither one handles it well or gracefully.
  Positive
This makes them very human.
  Positive
It's strangely touching, to see these two control-freak people submit to the conventions of a rom-com, spouting fitness metaphors the whole way.
  Positive
Love is not neat.
  Neutral
It's a mess and "Results" does not try to clean up the mess.
  Very negative
Guy Pearce is very funny in the role of Trevor, a good person who really cares about fitness: he's trying to create a "brand," but he doesn't really understand what that means.
  Positive
He is not a good businessman.
  Negative
When he is asked to explain himself, he flounders, but all with an eager "just hear me out" energy that ends up being charming and almost pathetic.
  Negative
Cobie Smulders, so intimidating in her first appearance in the film, manages to suggest that Kat is in a bit of an existential crisis.
  Very negative
She's almost .
  Neutral
Does she have any plans?
  Neutral
Is she good at anything else?
  Neutral
And Kevin Corrigan, sweaty and clueless, creepy and benign, brings depth and humor to every line that comes from his mouth.
  Negative
He's the outsider in the main world of the film, but he becomes its compelling center.
  Positive
Bujalski has carved out a very interesting place for himself in the world of independent film, starting with "Funny Ha Ha" , a low-budget putting it mildly film about post-graduates meandering aimlessly through their lives in New York, talking endlessly, kissing each other, getting into messes, and then floundering around in the mess.

"Mutual Appreciation"  continued that trajectory, only this time in black-and-white.

"Results" is less focused than "Computer Chess," but in a way that serves its particular story.

  Neutral
When the characters clamp down on their softness, on their natural affinity for one another, they cause chaos in their own lives.
  Negative
The whole movie is chaos.
  Negative
And that's a good thing.
  Positive
