Adapting a well-loved book for the screen is always a risky proposition.
  Neutral
Elements that work on the page will not work visually and vice versa.
  Negative
Compromises must be made.
  Neutral
You cannot please everyone.
  Negative
But the film version of "Winter's Tale" probably won'tplease anyone: neither fans of the book nor those who have never read it.
  Negative
It lacks visual splendor except for one or two scenes.
  Negative
It lacks emotional depth.
  Negative
It lacks scope and magic.
  Negative
It is clear that there is some big battle going on between Good and Evil and that  Will Smith is somehow involved, but none of it makes any sense.
  Negative
The philosophical underpinnings of the novel, its thoughts on the turning of the centuries and the millennium, and how cultures and societies go through giant upheaval during such moments, visible, and invisible, is completely lost in the New Age-y dreck drenching the narrative.
  Negative
Not even  Colin Farrell as the thief Peter Lake can save it, and he is doing his level best, with an urgent, heartfelt performance.
  Neutral
Mark Helprin's  novel is one of the most poetic of the late th century, and yet this film version has no poetry whatsoever.
  Positive
The opening of the film flies us around through time, from the s to , with Colin Farrell in both eras.
  Negative
It is a clue that we are not entering a realistic world, but it's so shoddily constructed that it's never entirely clear what you're supposed to be looking at.
  Negative
In the s, a thief named Peter Lake Colin Farrell is on the run from his former boss, a scarred monster named Pearly Soames  Russell Crowe, who seems totally adrift in this performance, hoping that a facial tic will somehow translate as menacing.
  Negative
Soames' black-derbied "droogs" chase Peter Lake through the Bowery, and Lake escapes via a nearby white horse who magically sprouts wings and flies over a locked gate.
  Negative
The visual effects are more My Pretty Pony than anything else.
  Negative
Lake, who must get out of Manhattan to escape Soames, breaks into a Central Park West mansion to rob the joint before fleeing town.
  Negative
There, he comes across Beverly Penn "Downton Abbey"'s  Jessica Brown Findlay in her nightgown, playing Brahms.
  Negative
She is a consumptive heiress with only six months to live.
  Neutral
Her body temperature runs so high that she sleeps in a tent on the roof of the mansion, hoping that the cold air will cool her down.
  Negative
Beverly makes a cup of tea for the thief, and the two characters from two different worlds sit in the kitchen, talk, and fall in love.
  Positive
Peter becomes convinced that he can find a way to save Beverly, and he thinks that maybe the magical white horse now his partner-in-crime might be able to help.
  Negative
He joins the Penn family in their winter retreat up the Hudson River, and passes muster with Beverly's stern father  William Hurt.
  Positive
Meanwhile, Pearly Soames is on his trail, but through some dark magic is not allowed to leave the boroughs of New York.
  Negative
He goes to request a weekend pass, basically, from the "Judge" Will Smith, a guy with earrings lounging in a bed in a subterranean dungeon.
  Negative
The scene that follows between the two of them, in which they suddenly turn into snarling, snapping demons, is incomprehensible.
  Negative
This is par for the course, I'm afraid.
  Negative
I read the book and I often had no idea what was going on in the movie, except that the growing love between Peter and Beverly is somehow threatening to the status quo and Pearly Soames must stop it.
  Negative
I think.
  Neutral
The current-day sections of the film feature Peter Lake, somehow transportedto , wandering around Manhattan with no memory.
  Negative
He comes across a kindly woman  Jennifer Connelly who wants to help him.
  Negative
One might think she had other things on her mind, such her young daughter, who's dying of cancer.
  Negative
Peter Lake also whisks away the dying child on the winged My Pretty Pony, and then there's a scene where he has a huge fist fight with Pearly Soames on the frozen ice of the Hudson while Jennifer Connelly sobs over to the side clutching her dying daughter.
  Very negative
Situations that should be touching become laughable.
  Positive
Eva Marie Saint shows up in the  section as a newspaper mogul.
  Negative
She has a breathtaking moment where she holds her arms out to Peter Lake.
  Positive
It is a beautiful reminder of her stature in American films.
  Very positive
Her presence almost justifies the film's existence.
  Positive
Almost.
  Neutral
The romance between Beverly and Peter is the only well-done plot line.
  Negative
This is entirely due to Farrell and Findlay.
  Positive
Farrell makes the love story work.
  Positive
He is sincere.
  Positive
He makes the hero's pain at Beverly's illness palpable.
  Neutral
When they finally make love in a tent on the roof, their passion has an emotional undercurrent that makes the sex scene about something other than sex.
  Positive
They connect.
  Neutral
There is a sadness in their connection, due to the shared knowledge that it will be short-lived.
  Positive
In her review of the novel, Barbara J. King describes the book as a " maelstrom-between-two-covers."
  Negative
and anyone who has loved the source material would probably agree.
  Negative
In the film, the maelstrom is gone, turned explicit and narrow.
  Negative
The novel has a passionate fan base and I obviously count myself among them.
  Positive
Akiva Goldsman, who wrote the screenplays for " I Am Legend" and " Angels and Demons", to name just two, adapted the book as well as directing the film.
  Negative
He's made a mess of it.
  Negative
There are a couple of beautiful images the glowing consumption tents on the top of mansions, the frozen-over Hudson, the nighttime stroll through the snowy forest, but there is no underlying story, there is no narrative thrust, magical or otherwise.
  Negative
"Winter's Tale" tells the story of a thief, a consumptive heiress, and a sentient magical white horse, but, really, it is the story of New York City in Helprin's imagination, a place like the one in reality but with some strange alterations.
  Positive
The Hudson freezes solid for miles, and people set up tent cities along the ice.
  Positive
There is a frozen magical town up-river where time takes on strange qualities.
  Positive
There is a whirling mysterious white cloud-wall that surrounds the island of Manhattan, a cloud-wall that everyone accepts to such a degree that no one notices it anymore.
  Negative
What is the cloud-wall?
  Neutral
What does it signify?
  Neutral
The wall is gone in Goldsman's version.
  Neutral
In the book, it is the whole point the reason for everything.
  Negative
Goldsman has missed the point of the book entirely.
  Negative
One leaves the novel reluctantly.
  Positive
One leaves the film with great relief that it is over.
  Very positive
