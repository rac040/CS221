  Positive
If there's one aspect that  Liev Schreiber captures perfectly in his portrayal of Wepner in Philippe Falardeau's feature film "Chuck," it is that energy, the energy of the loudest, most expansive braggart in any room, terrified that he is seen as some kind of a joke.
  Negative
"Chuck" struggles initially to find its footing, with an over-reliance on voiceover much of it inspired by the style of Ray Liotta's deadpan in " GoodFellas" and an extremely on-the-nose soundtrack "I Believe in Miracles" already over-used in film soundtracks playing over a scene of Wepner traveling to an important fight, etc.
  Negative
These choices dominate early on, and don't leave you any room to make up your own mind.

One of the most fascinating sequences in "Chuck" is when Sylvester Stallone steps into the story.
  Positive
Stallone is played by  Morgan Spector, who nails Stallone's distinctive voice, as well as his disarming openness and enthusiasm.
  Very positive
Wepner becomes so caught up in the "Rocky" thing that when he watches the film sweep the Oscars, it is as though he's part of the team that made it.

In many ways, he is an unbearable man, fragile and selfish and immature.
  Negative
Schreiber plays him as a man who lacks the ability to reflect, who is unable to correct himself.
  Negative
He's all appetite.
  Positive
He cannot say no to a challenge, a line of coke, a girl behind the bar.
  Negative
"Chuck" is smart in that it does not plead too much for us to sympathize with the main character.
  Positive
The approach is unfussy enough that it that makes you feel like you are just following Wepner around, observing him.
  Negative
There are scenes one, in particular that are almost too embarrassing to watch.
  Negative
But there's a tenacity in Wepner, a dogged self-belief, that is weirdly charming.
  Positive
You can understand why Phyllis is fed up, but you can also understand why Linda is drawn to him.
  Negative
Actors have a tendency to get grandiose when they play boxers.
  Negative
It's a pitfall with that kind of role.

Boxing movies have been as much a part of the movie industry's storytelling arsenal as the Western.
  Neutral
There's the visual fascination of the sport itself, the fighters' wordless commitment to physical movement, the ballet of it.
  Positive
There's also the thematic aspect that's a draw as a metaphor: a guy gutting through pain, standing up after being knocked down, the sheer endurance it takes to even get up the guts to walk into the ring.
  Negative
There's the cinematically rich sleaziness that surrounds the boxing world, bookies and gangsters, the temptations of easy money, drugs, floozies.
  Negative
We've seen it all before.
  Negative
"Chuck" does nothing new, and it moves through boxing tropes like it's ticking off checkmarks, but there's an honesty to it, a fresh and messy one.
  Positive
