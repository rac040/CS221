Loud, trashy, sweet and weird, the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers reboot Power Rangers is not merely an ideal film for rambunctious and undemanding -year olds, it actually sees the world through their eyes.
  Negative
In theory, the heroes are high school students.
  Neutral
But theyre actually a Disney Channel-styled fantasy of the splendors that await kids when they finally become full-fledged teenagers and can Do Whatever They Want.
  Positive
These heroes are misfits.
  Neutral
They gather in detention in their high school, a scenario that promises to turn into The Mighty Morphin Breakfast Club Rangers.
  Negative
Lo and behold, thats what you get: a mix of shenanigans, heart-to-heart talks and widescreen punch-outs between monster battles.
  Negative
The team consists of Jason Scott  Dacre Montgomery, the future Red Ranger, a juvenile delinquent with a barely disguised noble streak' Kimberly Hart  Naomi Scott, aka Pink Ranger, a depressive whos in detention for texting an embarrassing private photo of a classmate' Billy Cranston  RJ Cyler, aka Blue Ranger, whos got a spectrum disorder in this version' Becky G as Trini, the soon-to-be Yellow Power Ranger, who stays a blank slate until the movie fills in her backstory during the second half' and  Ludi Lin as Zack, the Black Ranger, who was African-American in the original TV series but has been cast as Asian here.
  Negative
The teens are trained by Zordon  Bryan Cranston, sole survivor of a prehistoric battle that ended with a meteor wiping out the dinosaurs.
  Negative
He wants them to defend the Earth against his nemesis, Rita Repulsa  Elizabeth Banks, by karate-kicking and body slamming Ritas beloved stone golems, then joining forces to defeat a gigantic golden warrior called Goldar.
  Negative
There's a plot about the Rangers trying to protect a crystal hidden inside a Krispy Kreme donut shop, and a detailed mythology about the life force of planets, but while Rangers purists will appreciate the fine points, the film doesn't get too hung up on them.
  Negative
The best way to save humanity, Zordon explains, is to kill Rita.
  Negative
To drive this point home, the film repeats the phrase kill Rita so often and with such zeal that it becomes a shared joke between the movie and the audience.
  Negative
Let's go and do the one thing that's been asked of us and kill Rita!"
  Negative
Jason exhorts his colleagues.
  Neutral
I shall destroy Rita myself!
  Negative
Zordon proclaims when the training isnt going so well.
  Neutral
The stronger together message of the original show has been given a post-Obama makeover here, sometimes convincingly, other times awkwardly.
  Negative
The films marketing hypes the fact that Trini has been re-imagined as the first openly gay superhero in movie history, and that is quite a milestone' but if you go out for popcorn in the scene where thats established you might not figure it out, unless you detect the undertones of Sapphic menace in the scene where Rita bullies Trini in her bedroom.
  Negative
Its like when Paramount congratulated itself for making Sulu gay in  Star Trek Beyond when all it did was give audiences a two-second glimpse of a photo revealing that Sulu's significant other was a man.
  Neutral
Um, thanks?
  Neutral
Billy, however, becomes a genuinely memorable character, thanks mainly to Cylers heartfelt performance which overcomes a lot of fuzziness about what, exactly, the characters condition is.
  Negative
And the screenplay makes this cheerful kid the heart and soul of the group, and sometimes its comic relief, without sapping him of dignity.
  Positive
Zack fares well, too: he loudly advertises himself as the crazy one, but in private moments he cares for his sickly mother with the same grim matter-of-factness that the title character of " Logan" brought into Professor Xs room along with meals and meds.
  Negative
Zack and his mom speak Mandarin with English subtitles, a nice touch.
  Positive
Writer  John Gatins and director  Dean Israelite make sure to take the characters emotions seriously even as they celebrate the ridiculousness of everything else.
  Negative
Nailing the tone in a film like this is so important that if you manage it, the audience will forgive missteps.
  Positive
There are plenty here, including haphazard plotting, connect-the-dots characterizations, and nervous, jittery, over-edited filmmaking that only snaps into coherence during a handful of crisp action scenes the best is an opening car chase done in a single take from inside a moving vehicle,  la  Let Me In and  Children of Men.
  Positive
But every time your eyes are about to roll back into your head at the films slovenly direction and editing, itll throw in moments of pathos or images of eerie beauty everything involving gold or water is aces.
  Positive
Or it will veer into three-hanky melodrama and inflict distress or bodily harm on a character youre surprised to realize youve grown to like.
  Neutral
The action is decent, occasionally splendid, near the end, although there are sure to be complaints that the movie takes too long to get the teens into their armor.
  Positive
It also hits too many overly familiar action film beats including a side-by-side power walk, but if it hadn't, a lot of viewers would wonder why the filmmakers were stinting on the stuff they came to see the power walk is pretty great.
  Very negative
What stands out about the film and what consistently saves it, even when the direction is at its cruddiest is its sincerity.
  Positive
Power Rangers really does believe that people are stronger united than when theyre going it alone, and it embeds that conviction into its action scenes.
  Negative
It also encourages its supporting players to cut loose and have fun, and boy, do they:  Bill Haders training robot is pleasingly droll.
  Positive
This is the pit, he chirps, showing the heroes a pit full of dirt and rocks, then adds, Its great, right?
  Positive
Banks slinky performance seems modeled equally on  Tim Currys Dr. Frank-N-Furter and  Sigourney Weaver as the demon-possessed Dana in the original Ghostbusters.
  Negative
She walks with slightly wobbly confidence, like a society lady whos too old to be wearing such high heels.
  Positive
This is a film where a character's dad drives a pickup truck into the middle of a superhero battle to make sure his son is okay, and another character shouts I love my mom!
  Positive
so joyously that it echoes in the canyons.
  Negative
Ive seen complaints that Power Rangers is too crude in its humor, too precious in how it establishes its characters' outsider status, and too obvious about its product placement the words Krispy Kreme  are spoken nearly as often as kill Rita.
  Negative
All three charges are true.
  Neutral
But I'd also suggest that a viewer's level of offense will likely be proportionate to how  thoughtful they expected a film like this to be.
  Negative
The  Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is a subsidiary of Saban Entertainment, created to sell merchandise.
  Positive
It never had much artistic integrity to lose, so the  fact that this film actually has some is amazing.
  Positive
This big-budget teen fantasy is essentially an unauthorized " Transformers" movie that has a moral code and is suitable for kids, in stark contrast to the actual "Transformers" franchise, which has prided itself on being snide, leering and hateful.
  Positive
"Power Rangers" is earnest and it has a good heart.
  Positive
There should be more movies like it, only better-made.
  Negative
