War for the Planet of the Apes is a film that unapologetically embraces the first word of its title.
  Positive
It opens with soldiers in a lush green forest with nicknames on their helmets, marching toward the enemy through the brush in a style that reminded me of  Platoon.
  Negative
Over the next two hours, other war films will flash through your mind, most commonly  Apocalypse Now, which  Matt Reeves excellent blockbuster cribs from openly, even turning its villain into a Colonel Kurtz in the heart of darkness, complete with shaved head and rambling philosophy.
  Negative
At one point, graffiti even reads Ape-pocalypse Now, as if to make clear that Reeves and company arent stealing as much as directly paying homage.
  Negative
So why turn a franchise about sentient apes into a war movie that echoes the stories of Vietnam?
  Negative
What can be gained from looking at the darkest side of humanity through the lens of a summer blockbuster?
  Neutral
The answer is quite a lot.
  Positive
After the traumatic infighting that served as the centerpiece for  Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Caesar  Andy Serkis and his fellow apes have become almost legendary, the animals in the woods that soldiers speak about with hushed tones.
  Negative
No one knows exactly where Caesar is or what his plans are, although we learn relatively quickly that his primary focus is survival.
  Neutral
Its an interesting narrative aspect of these films that Caesar so often seems to just be seeking peace, but hes drawn back into conflict by human beings who refuse to allow co-existence with a species that may be their superior.
  Positive
Thats exactly what happens when a character known only as The Colonel  Woody Harrelson attacks the apes camp, killing some of Caesars family.
  Negative
Now the ape learns another human emotion that often leads to tragedy: vengeance.
  Positive
How War for the Planet of the Apes unfolds from here is relatively simple, especially for the often plot-laden genre of the summer blockbuster.
  Positive
One of the many brilliant elements of the script by  Mark Bomback amp' Matt Reeves is its forced perspective.
  Positive
Other than that opening sequence, we stay almost entirely with only Caesar as he works his way to the mysterious human base with a few other simians and a mute girl they find along the way that they name Nova  Amiah Miller.
  Negative
For the midsection of the film, War for the Planet of the Apes also recalls a relative of the war movie in that it starts to feel like a modern Western, a road movie about a group of heroes riding to the town that has been overrun by the blackcoats.
  Negative
Again, the focus is remarkable.
  Positive
Dozens of other movies would have bounced us narratively back and forth between the Colonel and Caesar.
  Negative
Its much stronger and easier to identify with Caesar because were on the journey with him, knowing only what he knows, but the pressure to bring the human star back before the hour-mark must have been high.
  Neutral
Its so smart of Reeves, a great director who also made smart decisions with the last film in this series and the woefully underrated  Let Me In, to avoid it.
  Positive
Reeves works masterfully here through all elements of the production, but his two smartest decisions may have been in hiring a pair of people you wont see in any of the ads but who really help make this film the notable accomplishment that it is.
  Positive
The first is cinematographer  Michael Seresin, who imbues War with a rich, natural color palette that defies what weve come to expect from blockbusters.
  Neutral
The acclaimed cinematographer of films like  Birdy,  Angel Heart and  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban finds a way to emphasize the natural world around Caesar and his traveling companions in every sequence.
  Negative
Its a film that is inherently loaded with CGI and yet the images I think of when I remember it are built on foundations of snow, water, trees, etc.
  Negative
The second is bringing on the great composer  Michael Giacchino, who arguably does the best work of his career here, recalling both war films and great blockbuster scores of the s and s with compositions that become essential to the overall success of the film.
  Very positive
A stunning amount of War is silent more than any blockbuster I can remember so Giacchinos score becomes as important as the compositions for pre-sound films in the way it conveys emotion and even internal conflict.
  Positive
Its phenomenal.
  Positive
How do I convince viewers who may be reluctant to see a movie about talking apes that these three movies have transcended their concept to become one of the best Hollywood trilogies of their generation?
  Neutral
As with so much great science fiction which is really what a movie about evolving apes is in the end War for the Planet of the Apes is a mirror to what human beings are like in  as much as anything else.
  Positive
It is about infighting and vengeance.
  Neutral
It is about loss and the need for people to hold on tightly to that which keeps them going.
  Neutral
When our support systems are wrenched away, we respond with anger and violence.
  Negative
And when there are things in the world that we dont understand, we respond with fear and battles for control.
  Negative
All of this and so much more is woven through War for the Planet of the Apes in a way that often doesnt hit you until hours or days later.
  Positive
While it may be a few beats too long, especially in its multiple endings, its a shockingly memorable movie, the kind that gets better as you dissect and discuss how much it does right after the lights have gone up.
  Negative
And, lets not forget this important factor for summer movie dollars, its wildly entertaining.
  Positive
It has comedic beats many of them courtesy of Bad Ape, voiced memorably by  Steve Zahn to match its philosophical ones.
  Negative
It has action sequences, especially in the final act, to rival anything this year.
  Positive
And it closes out the Caesar Trilogy of Apes films in a way that feels rewarding and emotionally satisfying.
  Positive
Looking at Caesars face, I was reminded of  Clint Eastwoods aged visage in late-career Westerns, sternly looking at a horizon that he knows may be his last and allowing the ghosts of his past to play in his memory.
  Negative
I realized looking at that face that Caesar will be an iconic character, one that moviegoers watch for decades to come.
  Positive
And these films will only grow in esteem and acclaim.
  Negative
Greatness always does.
  Positive
