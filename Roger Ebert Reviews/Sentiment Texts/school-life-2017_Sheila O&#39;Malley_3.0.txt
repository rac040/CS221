Amanda and John Leyden stand in front of Headfort School located in Kells, Ireland, a school where the two of them taught for  years, watching the students boys and girls, ages  to , walking towards the main building an impressive Georgian-era mansion catching up with each other after summer break.
  Negative
The noise of the kids' chatter is deafening.
  Negative
Amanda, an elderly British woman, wearing a thick sweater and sensible shoes, can't stop smiling as she watches the flood of children pass her, and whispers to herself, "I love them!"
  Neutral
This spontaneous moment comes early in the documentary "School Life," co-directed by  Neasa N Chianin and  David Rane, and it is the kernel of what this film is about.
  Positive
It is a celebration of these two eccentric and devoted teachers and, by extension, teachers everywhere.
  Positive
We see them at work, we see them at rest, we see them kneeling by an open window smoking, wondering what they would ever do with themselves if they weren't doing this?
  Negative
Headfort is not the harrowing world of George Orwell's "Such Were the Joys" his essay about British boarding school life, one of the most painful personal essays ever written.
  Negative
Headfort is a paradise by comparison.
  Neutral
The children are given quite a bit of freedom to roam.
  Positive
They climb high into trees, with seemingly no adults around.
  Neutral
They build forts in the forest.
  Neutral
The classes are small, - students, so lots of time for group discussions, even about some controversial subjects one about same-sex marriage includes this comment from a serious-faced child: "Sometimes it's better to be gay than to be single."
  Negative
Amanda teaches English, and squeals with excitement about reading "The Famous Five" with her class.
  Positive
It was one of her favorites.
  Neutral
The students are encouraged to express themselves.
  Neutral
Because there are no to-the-camera interviews in "School Life," no confessionals, no pie-charts explaining the school's history or philosophy, the submergence into the school's atmosphere is total.
  Negative
We are on our own.
  Neutral
I don't think the name "Headfort" even comes up until some ways in.
  Neutral
The documentary is a rambunctious collage of a self-contained self-sustaining world, with its own rules of play and concerns.
  Negative
Children clatter down the stairs wearing cleats, bursting out onto the lawn for a rugby match.
  Negative
The kids climb into their bunk-beds at night for quiet reading time.
  Neutral
There's a sort of playroom workspace in one of the out-buildings, the walls covered in murals painted by the kids.
  Negative
It is here that John holds extremely eccentric band practices.
  Positive
He is in a quest to find a drummer.
  Neutral
'Can anyonedrum in this school?
  Neutral
,' he despairs.
  Neutral
Someone has painted "JIMI HENDRIX" in bright purple on the wall.
  Negative
Headfort, at times, feels like an Irish School of Rock.
  Negative
A couple of individual narratives emerge, involving three separate children: Ted, who is dyslexic, Florie, who was a child model in London and John worries that this has caused her low self-esteem, and Eliza, who hardly ever speaks.
  Negative
The film doesn't zoom in too much on these threads so that they take over.
  Negative
They are woven into the larger fabric of everyday life at the school, part of the tapestry of what goes on there, the endless issues that the teachers must manage.
  Positive
Is anyone getting lost in the shuffle?
  Negative
John says to Amanda, in one of their chats at home, "I just don't want Eliza to live her life  yards back from everybody else."
  Negative
There's some unevenness in the structure because of its resistance to zooming in too closely on this or that individual outside of the Leydens, that is, and even with them, we never learn where they came from, their backgrounds.
  Negative
We only know them from what we see them do.
  Negative
The score, by  Eryck Abecassis, is a bit too insistent and driving for a work as free-form as this.
  Negative
It's top-heavy.
  Neutral
What we get in the film, naturally, is the rhythms of life over the course of a year at the school, the seasons changing, the fog rolling across the grounds, or the snow driving against the main building.
  Negative
It's school as microcosm, an entire universe operating at full capacity.
  Negative
Both John and Amanda are naturally humorous people the film is often very funny, and they manage to be totally supportive while at the same time dry and witty wisecrackers.
  Positive
They care but they don't coddle.
  Neutral
Florie gives it a go at the drums, and she dissolves into tears when she falls behind the beat.
  Positive
John says to her, kindly, "Go and sit on the couch for five minutes and get yourself together."
  Negative
She needed that time, but it was herjob to get herself together.
  Neutral
It was a beautiful snapshot of the mixture of caretaking and independence that these children seem to find at Headfort.
  Positive
Up until very recently, the film was called "In loco parentis" a much more evocative title than the bland "School Life."
  Negative
"In loco parentis" means "in the place of a parent," which speaks directly to the film's theme, its reason for being.
  Positive
John and Amanda are that.
  Neutral
It is their life's work.
  Positive
Teaching is not a job.
  Negative
It is a calling.
  Positive
My sister teaches middle-school English, and has told amazing stories about kids who were never into reading suddenly "getting it," or a kid who was apathetic suddenly becoming the star of her annual class production of "Our Town."
  Positive
There's a whole section about Amanda putting on a production of "Hamlet," that made me think of my sister, of all teachers, who give so much, who care so much that the kids being successful is their success.
  Positive
This is not a new idea, but it is one that needs constant reiterating in a world where teachers are criminally undervalued.
  Negative
Amanda casts dyslexic Ted as the Ghost a risky proposition, but Amanda thinks he is up to the challenge.
  Negative
He will require tremendous coaching.
  Positive
The look on Amanda's face backstage when Ted nails his performance as the Ghost is worth the price of admission.
  Positive
