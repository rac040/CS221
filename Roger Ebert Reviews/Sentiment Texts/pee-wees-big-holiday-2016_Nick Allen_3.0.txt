More than his constant self-amusement, singular costuming or aggressive boyishness, the dark artifice of Pee-wee Hermans life has always been the characters most fascinating characteristic.
  Positive
How does a person, even in a cartoonish world, become this way?
  Neutral
How does one find everything so funny all of the time, while often resisting intimacy?
  Positive
What is the world like for them when they go home alone and turn off the light?
  Neutral
His latest adventure may not be the  Michael Haneke and Pee-wee Herman collaboration that I would pay a hundred dollars to see just a preview of, but it is an entertaining romp starring one of the ultimate figures of arrested development, made possible by the King Midas of man-child comedy, executive producer  Judd Apatow.
  Negative
Directed by  John Lee the other perfect pick for a Pee-wee Herman movie considering his previous TV-MA kids show Wonder Showzen, Pee-wees Big Holiday starts off with nostalgia and promise.
  Negative
In the first scene, Pee-wee played by  Paul Reubens has a bizarre nightmare that has him screaming in his sleep, I cant leave here!
  Negative
Seconds later, its morning, the darkness has subsided, and it's back to his Rube Goldberg routine, an operation that is bigger and better than ever.
  Negative
In a way that kicks down the door on any skeptics, this wondrous re-introduction broadcasts the inspiration behind this decades-overdue sequel, and is so giddy that it makes the home viewing of Netflix feel like a bit of a downgrade along with other jokes here, its the type of fun you want to witness with a lot of strangers in a dark room.
  Positive
What happens next is even more exciting: a brief look into Pee-wees life, a glimpse at how he might be able to pay the bills, or what he does with his day when were not watching him.
  Positive
We see that he works at an old diner, a place thats just one entity in the disturbingly vintage town of Fairville, which is decked out in minty, saturated colors, showing a Cartoon Festival at the main street monoplex, and might as well be called  Pleasantville.
  Negative
If Pee-wee Herman is a walking time capsule, then the kitchen of the Fairville diner, where he cooks alone, is the environment in which he is stored.
  Negative
As happenstances so readily find Pee-wee in his films, so does  Magic Mike actor  Joe Manganiello, who influences him to travel outside of Fairville for the first time.
  Negative
By this point, the script from Reubens and  Paul Rust has achieved a rich amount of context before it sets Pee-wee off on his travels.
  Negative
Most importantly, it places Pee-wees Big Holiday as a staunch reboot, taking place in a world where Pee-wees Big Adventure, or even the nightmare fuel that is the heavily-implied sex scene from  Big Top Pee-wee, never happened.
  Negative
Born again under Apatows tutelage as The -Year-Old Virgin, Pee-wee embarks on a journey that, with respect to an email I received from Pee-wee himself via the computer he had installed in his  Broadway special, one assumes, I shall tread lightly with.
  Negative
The unpredictable but quick moments that happen to Pee-wee fall in thematic line with his existence, where a modern world is full of people who resist the passage of time, characters dressed in Russ Meyer-inspired costume design, the Amish while middle-aged men often openly mourn maturity, whether theyre living in the woods or are Joe Manganiello.
  Negative
As comedy, the events are more often charming than funny' even when some sequences fall flat, they show a dedication to the surrealism thats charismatic.
  Positive
In this ultimately successful showcase for his masterpiece character, Pee-wee becomes a perfect Pagliacci for Apatows authorship, a clown inspired by the comedy and tragedy of wearing the same clothes in the same place for a duration of time in which age becomes obsolete.
  Positive
Even the way in which the lighting tries to hide the wrinkles on Reubens face is fascinating, his attempts to appear ageless creating a new mask.
  Negative
But even if he feels to be laughing to himself a little less than usual, inspiration continues to flow through Reubens.
  Negative
For all of the films spectacle, he has a show-stopping moment with a balloon, as shot in one take.
  Positive
Aside from being as funny as it is elementary, it will remind you of how this masterpiece character transcends age, and instill hope that hell have more adventures before he can no longer leave his playhouse.
