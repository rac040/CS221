Some mediocre movies just dont make sense' you can never understand why they went into production in the first place.
  Negative
The script was clearly a mess when someone bought it, it was never going to be profitable, and no one involved had the skill to pull it off.
  Very negative
Why did they even bother?
  Negative
Live by Night makes total sense.
  Negative
On paper, it seems like a cant-fail proposition.
  Negative
Not only is director  Ben Affleck coming off a Best Picture Oscar for his last directorial effort,  Argo, but he started his already-impressive directorial career with an adaptation of a novel by the same author of the source material,  Dennis Lehane, who not only penned  Gone Baby Gone but  Mystic River,  Shutter Island, and others.
  Negative
The cast is talented from top to bottom, including Oscar winners and charismatic actresses to play opposite Affleck.
  Very positive
The sprawling gangster story was given more than enough budget to pull it off, and even landed a release date that typically coincides with awards attention.
  Negative
So, the key question behind Live by Night isnt so much Why did they bother?
  Negative
as What went wrong?
  Neutral
Live by Night is the story of the rise of a relatively low-level mobster named Joe Coughlin Affleck during Prohibition.
  Neutral
Sorta.
  Neutral
Kinda.
  Neutral
Well get to how this epic story on the page lacked an interesting enough protagonist for the screen later.
  Positive
For now, know that Coughlin is on the rise in Boston, aided a bit by his cop father  Brendan Gleeson, great even in what amounts to basically a one-scene role and in love with local mob boss Albert Whites  Robert Glenister daughter Emma  Sienna Miller.
  Negative
After ripping off a few poker games, Joe decides hes going to rob a bank and run away with Emma, but Albert gets wind of it and double crosses poor Joe, nearly killing him.
  Negative
Coughlin runs to Florida, but hes not done with the criminal underworld.
  Negative
In fact, hes reporting back to Whites Italian nemesis, Maso Pescatore  Remo Girone, and essentially building an empire in Ybor, where hes taken over the rum trade.
  Negative
In doing so, he meets a girl named Graciela  Zoe Saldana, who does a lot with a little and comes to a gentlemans agreement with local lawman Chief Figgis  Chris Cooper, who lets him do what he needs to as long as he stays in the right geographical boundaries.
  Negative
While in Florida, Coughlin runs afoul of the Ku Klux Klan, and meets Figgis daughter Loretta  Elle Fanning, who will play a major role in whether or not this Northerner builds a casino set to open just as Prohibition ends.
  Negative
Crime epics such as Lehanes book that cross state lines and years of plot require a confident hand with an artistic vision to guide them to the big screen.
  Negative
Affleck simply doesnt seem to have much passion for the material.
  Negative
His previous directorial efforts displayed a sense of urgency thats lacking here.
  Negative
Whatever faults you may find in his other three films, they had momentum, especially nail-biting works like  The Town and Argo.
  Negative
Live by Night is almost stunningly momentum-less.
  Negative
It often plods from plot point to plot point.
  Negative
Some scenes go on far too long, especially in the final act when Affleck is trying to wring emotion from a script that doesn't have it, while others feel truncated in the editing room.
  Negative
The pacing is just off here, which keeps us from being engaged or immersed in the world.
  Negative
Another key element that curtails immersion is a lack of grit.
  Negative
Theres no sweat or dirt in this world.
  Negative
Everything looks too finely tailored and the violence and sex lacks any sort of real pain or heat.
  Negative
Its not as egregious as some recent dress-up movies Im looking at you,  American Pastoral but never once does it feel like were being transported in place or time.
  Negative
Its a backlot with a costume budget and a design team who should have been told to scuff a floor or fray a hem here or there.
  Neutral
The real tragedy and the reason my rating isnt lower is that there are moments and performances that work.
  Positive
Gleeson, Miller, Fanning, Saldana, Cooper this is one heck of a cast that Affleck and his producers have assembled, and they find nice little notes to hit every now and then.
  Positive
Its a movie with effective scenes and character choices, theyre just not linked together in any way that makes them entertaining or emotionally resonant as a whole.
  Positive
Which brings us to the final and really the biggest problem of Live by Night.
  Neutral
Lehane wrote an epic novel that includes Prohibition, Irish amp' Italian mobs, racism, religious fanaticism, addiction, and much more, taking place over years of American history.
  Negative
The film version doesnt feel like it has any of that kind of ambitious scope.
  Positive
It is the story of a dude who got in a couple shoot-outs and made some money off rum, a footnote in the history of cinematic mob stories.
  Neutral
Maybe the real question that no one ever answered should have been Why should we care?
  Neutral
