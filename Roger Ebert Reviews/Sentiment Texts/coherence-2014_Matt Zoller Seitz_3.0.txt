"Coherence" is proof that inventive filmmakers can do a lot with a little.
  Positive
Written and directed by James Ward Byrkit, the movie starts out looking and feeling like half the no-budget indies you've seen: a bunch of seemingly well-off people attend a dinner party at a nice suburban house somewhere in Northern California on the night that a comet is scheduled to pass near the earth.
  Negative
They introduce themselves to each other, hang out, drink, eat and deliver expository banter.
  Positive
Then things get weird, and weirder.
  Neutral
"Coherence" was produced on a shoestring.
  Neutral
You can tell.
  Neutral
It's shot with multiple video cameras, often wildly, and while much of the overlapping dialogue is comprehensible, some sinks into audio muck.
  Negative
A lot of the action in this night-set film is confined to the interior of the house.
  Negative
When the characters venture outdoors, it's hard to tell what's going on because you can barely see the actors.
  Negative
That the comet has allegedly wrought havoc with electricity only partly excuses this.
  Negative
Even on a moonless night in a forest, your eyes adjust.
  Negative
Amazingly, though, none of the movie's technical or artistic shortcomings prove to be deal breakers.
  Negative
Once "Coherence" delves into its premise, the viewer is bound to come down with a bad case of the creeps.
  Negative
This is a less-is-more science fiction-horror tale, indebted to the original "The Twilight Zone" particularly "The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street" as well Luis Bunuel's " The Exterminating Angel," as well as certain recent science fiction indies that I won't name here because I did, you'd immediately deduce the film's first big twist.
  Negative
Spoilers start in the next paragraph.
  Neutral
And it's genuinely more of a horror film than a suspense or "terror" film because, while there's some violence, the source of unease is philosophical.
  Positive
The characters are frightened by what they don't know, then by the implications of what they've been able to figure out.
  Negative
What's being threatened in "Coherence" is who they are, or what they think they are' not just the integrity of their bodies though that's at risk, too but their identities.
  Negative
This is an ensemble movie, but its closest thing to a protagonist is Em Emily Foxler, who has a great reactive face, a dancer whose career has suffered an unspecified setback.
  Positive
Em shows up at the party with her boyfriend Kevin  Maury Sterling of Homeland who proceeds to add tension to the evening by offering up an anecdote involving his ex-girlfriend Laurie  Lauren Maher, who's also a guest.
  Negative
Also on hand is Mike  Nicholas Brendon of "Buffy" whose greatest performance might be as a guy who isn't depressed and irritated that nobody remembers that he starred on "Roswell."
  Negative
There's a pagan cleric type namedBeth  Elizabeth Gracen, and a tall, volatile, bearded guy named Hugh  Hugo Armstrong who keeps trying to contact a friend who seems to have inside knowledge of all the strange goings-on disrupted cell phone service, power outages and the like.
  Negative
The first vertigo-inducing moment comes when Hugh returns from an expedition to the only fully lighted house in the neighborhood and reports that he peeked through the windows and saw them the members of that very group having dinner.
  Neutral
In the other house.
  Neutral
In the other house!!
  Neutral
There are mysterious notes left on the front door' numbered photographs of the principal characters one seemingly taken that very day' accusations that a certain character is not really that character' wary or secretive expressions on the faces of people you thought you could trust.
  Negative
What on earth, or in the heavens, is going on?
  Negative
I'll stop here because I don't want to oversell the movie.
  Negative
It's not a masterpiece, not by a long shot, but it does demonstrate a refreshing willingness to embrace the unknown, the implied, the mysterious.
  Positive
And although it takes a left turn near the end that some viewers might not like, you should at least give it credit for refusing to get complacent.
  Negative
This is a confident movie that feels like the first entry in career worth following.
  Very positive
