In a sense, the weirdest thing about Gimme Danger is how not weird it is.
  Negative
Its subject, James Osterberg, also known as  Iggy Pop, also known as Iggy Stooge, is not just a rock and roll survivor so to speak of the first stripe.
  Negative
Hes also, like it or not, one of the maverick eccentrics of the form and the lively arts in general.
  Negative
Hes a rock classic, but if your idea of Classic Rock is Boston, hes also a major weirdo.
  Negative
Similarly,  Jim Jarmusch, the director of this documentary, is a filmmaker whose work is arguably not inaccessible but whose aesthetic lies pretty far outside of what we know as the mainstream.
  Positive
Gimme Danger is by far the most conventional film hes ever made.
  Negative
I think thats a very purposeful feature of the film.
  Positive
Gimme Danger is subtitled Story of The Stooges and thats important the movie doesnt give much play to Iggys long and varied solo career, which at many points was far more commercially successful than that of the band he co-founded and fronted in the late s. Jim Jarmusch has described it as a love letter to the Stooges, but it is also a kind of brief for the band.
  Negative
Its accessible form, in which the normally more minimalist Jarmusch resorts to a lot of the standard tropes of the contemporary documentary talking head style more or less interviews, far-reaching archival footage, even animated recreations of events described by the participants seems to me as an attempt to reach the skeptics in the audience, and convince them that Jarmusch may be right when he calls The Stooges The greatest rock and roll band ever.
  Negative
This viewer did not need much convincing, I admit.
  Negative
The 's and 's Stooges only pulled off one album that I would call perfect, which is s Fun House, and the reason I am able to call it perfect is that I have a higher tolerance for horrible noise which is what that records final cut L.A. Blues is mostly made of than many others.
  Very negative
Considered without L.A. Blues, though, Fun House is such a tensile model of ultra-aggressive rock and roll as to be considered miraculous.
  Positive
How did they do it?
  Neutral
Iggy has an interesting answer: having assembled the right three partners in musical crime brother Ron and Scott Asheton on guitar and drums respectively, with Dave Alexander on bass singer and rhythm technician trained as a drummer, he collaborated with Scott on the groups beats Iggy recalls, I just started jumping up and down like baboons do when theyre about to fight, which provoked his bandmates into a sort of frenzy.
  Very negative
And the rest is Now I Wanna Be Your Dog, and more.
  Negative
Both Ron Asheton and Scott Asheton have died in recent years, but not before reuniting with Pop for a Stooges revival in the early  st  century.
  Negative
Jarmusch has been working on this project for some time, and so was fortunate enough to log good, informative interviews with the relatively taciturn Ashetons for the movie.
  Positive
They come across as salt-of-the-earth Ann Arbor guys.
  Neutral
Ron explains his penchant for wearing Nazi regalia on stage in the early days by talking about his veteran dads willy-nilly memorabilia collecting habits.
  Neutral
It wasnt anything political, he says, and probably was not, but it was still a crummy idea and Asheton seems to realize it while also believing it might not be very rock and roll to admit it.
  Negative
James Williamson, the Raw Power guitarist memorialized in Pops solo song Dum Dum Boys as the Stooge whos gone straight and indeed he had a prosperous career in software development at Sony after he got out of music for a while, brings a somewhat more plainly objective perspective to bear when considering the drug-fueled anarchy of some Stooges gigs and tours.
  Negative
Pop himself recalls upsetting people wherever we went.
  Neutral
In an often-seen clip from the  Dinah Shore talk show of the s, he boasts, I think I helped wipe out the 's.
  Negative
And what a way to go.
  Neutral
Jarmusch lays out the Stooges story in a coherent, linear fashion.
  Negative
Fans like myself wont necessarily learn a whole lot thats new, but its salutary the way Pop pays respect to the black musicians he followed from Detroit to Chicago during the musical apprenticeship of his teens.
  Negative
Johnny Ramone rather controversially said that with the Ramones he wanted to create an aggressive rock form that was, among many other things, white, and cited The Stooges as a model in this respect.
  Positive
Gimme Danger shows that Stooges music, like all rock, had deep roots in black music, albeit a black music that did not get heard much outside of certain regions of the country.
  Negative
But of course it took the personalities and proclivities of the band members to make their new thing happen.
  Neutral
Early champion Danny Fields cites their genius and their lack of professionalism talk about understatement as being so intertwined as to be inextricable.
  Negative
And yet from the expanding wreckage the Stooges left in their wake there was a good amount of great music and an even bigger amount of influence.
  Positive
The movie is frequently moving, particularly in its account of the alcohol-abetted death of bassist Alexander, and the almost phoenix-like rise of the reunited band in recent years.
  Negative
This is a history lesson that, conventional or not, rocks hard.
  Negative
It cant help it.
  Positive
