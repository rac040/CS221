Ruby  Jamie Chung, a Chinese-American new to Hong Kong, stands outside a bar attempting to track down her friends.
  Negative
She has no idea where she is.
  Neutral
A guy overhears her and steps in to help.
  Neutral
This is Josh  Bryan Greenberg, who has lived in Hong Kong for  years.
  Neutral
He's "in finance."
  Neutral
He knows his way around and speaks Cantonese.
  Positive
After momentary hesitation on her part, the two of them set out into the neon-gleam glamour of Hong Kong on a night-long "walk and talk."
  Negative
Their bantering conversation has all the markings of a successful albeit accidental first date, punctuated by sight-seeing.
  Positive
The formula of "Already Tomorrow in Hong Kong," written, directed, and produced by  Emily Ting her first feature is one that has worked before.
  Positive
But the film lacks the underlying subtext that grounded similar hopeful-yet-doomed-romance stories in the past.
  Negative
The dialogue, charmingly delivered by the two leads, remains on a surface jokey level.
  Negative
The stakes are not high enough for either character and the two-people-at-a-fork-in-the-road story never comes to life, a practically fatal flaw.
  Negative
The essential element that such stories must achieve is the knowledge that the two characters need to be together.
  Positive
An audience must ache for the characters to break through to deeper intimacy with one another.
  Negative
As Josh walks Ruby to her destination, they get to know each other and he shows her the sights.
  Neutral
Josh expresses dissatisfaction with his finance job and wants to quit and be a novelist.
  Neutral
Of course he does.
  Neutral
Ruby, who barely knows him, launches into an inspirational speech about taking chances.
  Negative
He appears blown away by her banal insight.
  Negative
It's hard to believe he has never heard such a thing before.
  Negative
But it sets up the too-easy idea that his "brief encounter" with Ruby changes the course of his life.
  Positive
Ruby, too, a toy-designer, has unrealized dreams.
  Negative
These are familiar devices and they can work.
  Positive
Ruby and Josh are so financially fortunate no crime in that, they both work hard it has softened them, made them lazy, complacent.
  Negative
Ruby barely notices Hong Kong, and complains about the lack of Netflix and the fact that it is impossible to get good Mexican food.
  Negative
Josh knows the cool non-tourist places to go, but has no perspective on his circumstances outside of the fact that, to Los Angelenos, it's "already tomorrow in Hong Kong."
  Neutral
Ruby and Josh, then, seem un-curious, and un-engaged with their own lives.
  Negative
It's hard to invest in two people who have so readily taken the easy way out.
  Negative
Ruby and Josh both have off-screen partners who make their presence known through phone messages or Outlook reminders of an upcoming Skype call.
  Neutral
Their emotions towards their respective partners are ambivalent at best, and the problem with that is that the two come off as people looking for an excuse to cheat as opposed to a situation much more unstable and important.
  Positive
You know a "romance" film isn't working when you think in exasperation, "Oh, go ahead, just cheat if your relationship bores you so much.
  Negative
No one'll know."
  Neutral
Or: "Break up with your partner.
  Neutral
For God's sake, you're not married.
  Negative
No harm no foul."
  Neutral
It's not the most romantic vibe.
  Negative
Cinematographer  Josh Silfen provides a welcome variety of angles to all the talk, the camera sometimes following the two from behind, or swinging around to move along ahead of them.
  Positive
Silfen also shows a visual sensitivity to the lights of Hong Kong: they blur and twinkle in the backgroundforeground, creating a dreamy atmosphere.
  Positive
It's a poetic style that serves a purpose: despite the attention-getting surroundings, the focus is on the one-on-one interaction of Ruby and Josh.
  Positive
The style keeps "Already Tomorrow in Hong Kong" from being a glorified travelogue, but unfortunately it also hones in on the lack of chemistry between the two leads.
  Negative
Both Greenberg and Chung were executive producers on the film.
  Neutral
Both are obviously talented.
  Positive
Greenberg is effortlessly charming in a very real-guy kind of way.
  Positive
And Chung manages the switch-backs of mood and energy with ease.
  Positive
But Josh and Ruby "bond" during a conventional shopping montage, where they haggle over the price of a selfie stick, and an awkward scene where they get their fortunes told.
  Negative
Think of  River Phoenix and  Lili Taylor in " Dogfight," which has a similar "sightseeing" structure, or  Ethan Hawke and  Julie Delpy in " Before Sunrise" paying the guy lying by the river to write a poem for them, and the difference is palpable.
  Negative
What is missing is the magic of connection.
  Neutral
"Already Tomorrow in Hong Kong" is in the long tradition of extended "meet-cutes," films like Vincente Minnelli's "The Clock," David Lean's "Brief Encounter," Nancy Savoca's "Dogfight" and Richard Linklater's "Before" trilogy.
  Negative
There are elements of cultural disorientation too, reminiscent of Sofia Coppola's " Lost in Translation."
  Positive
It is clear that Ting knows the "bucket" in which she wants to place her story, and the mood of self-control and bittersweet longing she wants to create.
  Positive
There are moments, brief moments, when that tone is achieved, but overall Ruby and Josh's connection has more in common with the feather-weight "relationship" of  Meryl Streep and  Robert DeNiro in " Falling in Love" than the torment of "Brief Encounter" or the urgency of "The Clock."
  Negative
If nothing else, "Already Tomorrow in Hong Kong" is an object lesson in just how difficult it is to make a film successful with this story-structure.
  Negative
It reminds us what a miracle "The Clock" or "Before Sunrise" were, the stories shimmering with delicacy and inference, in-depth conversations leading to connections more intellectual than sexual, masterpieces of barely-controlled passion and longing.
  Neutral
"Already Tomorrow in Hong Kong" suffers in comparison.
  Negative
