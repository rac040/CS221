If youre a fan of Mexican film and television star Omar Chaparro, Ive got some good news and some bad news.
  Negative
The good is that Chaparro is starring in his first crossover-to-Hollywood picture.
  Positive
The bad is that I bet it isnt the crossover-to-Hollywood picture he was hoping for.
  Negative
The compact Chaparro he could be a blockier cousin to Antonio Banderas by way of  George Clooney is here saddled to an unlikely-buddy-cop movie.
  Negative
Maybe youve heard of those.
  Neutral
His foil is a fat teenage computer hacker in L.A. whos gotten himself in inadvertent trouble with some very nasty drug traffickers.
  Negative
He's played by  Joey Morgan, which is maybe good news for fans of  Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse, in which Morgan played  yes, the fat one.
  Negative
This movie, which is what youd call a god-awful mess, doesnt even introduce Morgans character until about a half an hour in.
  Very negative
Thats how conscientiously structured it is.
  Positive
Instead, it begins with Chaparros character, Garza, in a kitchen playing with an adorable toddler and making small talk with the toddlers mother, his partners wife.
  Negative
She tells him he really ought to settle down, family is everything, etc.
  Neutral
Whereupon Garza takes said partner out on a drug bust and, well take a wild guess.
  Positive
With the partner dead, the wife and daughter are never seen again.
  Negative
Garzas taken out for a drink by his commanding officer, who chides him very mildly for not waiting for backup.
  Negative
Garza eyes the fetching barmaid, and starts seeing her in slow motion.
  Neutral
Not since David Al Hedison cheerfully invited  Timothy Dalton to go fishing mere days after his character, Felix Leiter, watched his own wife get eaten by a shark which also chomped off his own leg in License To Kill has a movie character shucked off tragedy so casually.
  Negative
But wait.
  Neutral
Theres a  well I wouldnt say method to the plot beats concocted by directorco-writer  Enrique Begne and co-writers  Ted Perkins and Gabriel Ripstein staggeringly, the son of Mexican cinema giant Arturo Ripstein.
  Positive
The barmaid and Garza end up together, in a family way, and then shes kidnapped by the same drug dealers who got his partner, and the U.S. feds get involved  Eric Roberts plays the head honcho.
  Negative
It's a big mess.
  Negative
Its an even bigger mess because the movie is so haphazardly edited.
  Very negative
One understands the effect that Begnes aiming for flashing forward and backward in short order during certain scenes to highlight bits of information that are meant to pay off in aha!s for the viewer but the execution is staggeringly shoddy and stumbling.
  Negative
The ostensible humor diarrhea jokes, amputated-finger-of-a-corpse jokes, burning-people-alive jokes competes with plot complications thrown about willy-nilly.
  Negative
To make matters worse, the movie looks like it was color-corrected with the Hot Pink dial turned all the way up for the whole time.
  Negative
I know.
  Neutral
There isnt really a Hot Pink dial on a color-correcting console.
  Negative
But you know what Im saying.
  Neutral
Eventually, the movie works up a weird fascination.
  Positive
At one point the viewer may be moved to ask, silently, of Chaparros Garza, Yes, sure, you left the pistol with which  Kevin Pollak was trying to kill himself in the trash can of the mens room of this diner.
  Negative
But now that the eccentric bad guys have shown up, dont you still have that huge Magnum you stole off of the Irish convenience store clerk with whom you had a fist fight  minutes ago?
  Negative
And so on.
  Neutral
The answer was, Yes, but he must have forgotten, as he pulls it out in a later scene.
  Negative
As the movie resolves in a truly, um, unusual plot twist, I guess Im glad I stayed to the end.
  Negative
Well, actually, no.
  Negative
I only stayed to the end out of professional obligation.
  Negative
In another set of circumstances I could have not learned of the plot twist and had a perfectly fine remainder of my life.
  Negative
