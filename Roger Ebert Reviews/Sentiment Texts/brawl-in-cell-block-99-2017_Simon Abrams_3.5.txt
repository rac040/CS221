Or break several other men's heads open with a few powerful stomps?
  Neutral
The grisly prison picture-action drama "Brawl in Cell Block " assumes that the answers are yes, yes and yes.
  Negative
You do not watch this film so much as gape at its'creators' flights ofderanged inspiration.
  Negative
"Weird" does not begin to cover the depth of its tough-guyeccentricities.
  Negative
The writer and director is S. CraigZahler, the mind behind the horror-western" Bone Tomahawk."
  Negative
Working with cinematographer  Benji Bakshi, he takes great pains to show youhisactors' entirebodies during fight scenes.
  Positive
He also wrote the original Ramp'B score, which is performed by the legendary Butch Tavares and theO'Jays.
  Negative
The movie makes a star of Vince Vaughn again by casting him as antihero Bradley Thomas, a skinhead drug dealer who must pummel and stomp two prisons' worth of inmates and guards in order to protect his kidnapped wife and daughter.
  Negative
Like "Bone Tomahawk" before it, "Brawl in Cell Block " starts off slow.
  Negative
The script takes its time setting up Bradley asa generally sympathetic hot-head whois also mercurial enoughto gradually become the film's real antagonist.
  Negative
After he's fired from his auto-repair gig and discovers his wife Lauren  Jennifer Carpenter has been cheating on him, he dismantles her car.
  Negative
But he keeps it together long enough to show that he has a plan and has previously earned Lauren's trust offscreen, sometime prior to the film's events.
  Negative
He tells Lauren thathe will resume an old, well-paying job delivering drugs in order tobring more money home, swears that he  wantsto reinvigorate their marriage by having a baby with her, then accepts her apology and asks her if she will "abide" by his terms.
  Negative
He makes this requestafter destroying her cell phone and totaling her car, mind you' nevertheless, Lauren agrees to abide.
  Positive
Suffice it to say that Bradley eventually ends up in prison, where he is forced to keep his rage in check despitenumerous dehumanizing factors.
  Neutral
Sporting a shaved head with a huge crucifix tattooed on the back, Vaughn looks like an editorial cartoon of urban crime come to life.
  Negative
He's a damn good boogeyman: an unrepentant rage-case with a knack for brutality.
  Positive
But he does everything purposefully, from race-baiting Mexican bodybuilders tobreaking the bones of white and black prison guards alike.
  Negative
And the writing convinces you that he believes in family values as well as in the idea that you should never start a fight you aren't willing to finish.
  Positive
The character is made nearly charming by his martyr-likewillingness tosilentlysufferungodly punishment, his hard-boiled quips, hiswing chun-meets-boxing fighting skills, and most of all by Vaughn's performance, which is revealed mostly through the actor's stiff gait, arch posture, and furiouspunches augmented by meat-slab sound effects.
  Very negative
Zahler has given Vaughn one of his most satisfying dramatic roles to date, and the actor makes Bradley seem as evidentlyvolatile as he is potentially heroic.
  Positive
"Brawl in Cell Block " is a grade-A piece of meathead cinema, the kind of exploitationmovie whose deepest thoughts areAm I more animal than human?
  Positive
andHow far is a man willing to go to protect his loved ones?
  Positive
Thesewould beinsufferably trite themes if Zahler wasn't so good at drawing viewers in with sensationally staged violence and carefully observed details: the long shadows cast by billiard balls, the rustle of curtains, the eerie stillness of a door before it's bashed in, the pauses Bradley takes between beatings.
  Negative
That having been said: the real reason you will either love or hate "Brawl in Cell Block " is its hyper-stylized violence.
  Negative
These scenes are inventively shot and choreographed by fight coordinator  Drew Leary and Zahler so that we can see the actors' bodies and faces.
  Negative
This could not have been an easy task, since Bakshi's camera always seems to be wherever Leary needs it to not be.
  Negative
Nevertheless, Zahler's presentation of hisactors and stunt performers makes every bone-splintering, limb-destroying, flesh-rending practical special effect that much more effective.
  Negative
Zahler is on to something when he says as he did at a recent post-screening Qamp'A that he thinks of movie gore as a magic trick.
  Neutral
"Brawl in Cell Block " isn't for the squeamish, nor for anyone who dislikes theidea of cheeringon a guy who, in reality, wouldn'tbe as benign as his creators want us to think.
  Negative
But if you are willing to suspend your disbelief for  minutes, you mayfind yourself head-over-heels for this film's brand of gross, thoughtfulpulp fiction.
