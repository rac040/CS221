Its troubling how simplistic films geared toward teens tend to be, considering that there is nothing simple about adolescence.
  Negative
This years  Nicholas Sparks adaptation,  The Choice, infantilized its audience by treating them like a child whose pet lizard had just died.
  Negative
Rather than deal with the difficult questions posed by its own premise, the film whipped out an insultingly artificial deus ex machina in its final moments, rendering the titular choice irrelevant.
  Very negative
The Choice couldve easily served as the title for  Valerie Weisss A Light Beneath Their Feet, since its characters find themselves faced with questions for which there are no easy answers.
  Negative
Yet just as Weiss opted for a title more provocative than generic, the film itself is so much deeper than its teen movie surface would suggest.
  Negative
The genre staples are all here mean girls, attractive loners, a song-filled soundtrack, even a prom sequence but they are all deceptive.
  Positive
There are no heroes and villains or freaks and geeks in this story, just ordinary people struggling to create a sense of normalcy in their day-to-day existence.
  Negative
At the center of the film is Beth  Madison Davenport, a high school senior who, like most people her age, is uncertain about her future.
  Negative
Her mother, Gloria  Taryn Manning, was diagnosed years ago with bipolar disorder, which subsequently led to the dissolution of her marriage.
  Negative
I loved her but I needed to leave her, explains Beths father  Brian King, and his words will resonate with anyone who has ever loved someone with a similar affliction.
  Positive
Unfortunately, his absence from the house has caused Beth to become Glorias full-time caregiver, a role that repeatedly threatens to consume the entirety of her life.
  Very negative
Though Beth is planning to enroll at Northwestern University, the college located in her hometown of Evanston, Illinois, she secretly yearns to attend UCLA, in part because of the familiar weather patterns on the West Coast.
  Negative
What a rejuvenating change of pace this would provide from the volatile temperature shifts in the Midwest, as well as the volatile emotions at home.
  Negative
The fact that Gloria takes great comfort in her daughter remaining close to home naturally makes Beth all the more reluctant to leave.
  Positive
Rarely have the dynamics of a loving yet unhealthy relationship been explored with as much tenderness and insight as they are here by Weiss and screenwriter  Moira McMahon.
  Negative
The deep and abiding love between mother and daughter is never in doubt, and since Gloria had Beth at a young age, there are moments when the two women resemble twins, particularly in the exquisite shot where they regard their reflections at a clothing shop.
  Negative
Beth laughs at their matching hats and flamboyant poses, but her smile gradually crumbles upon the realization that shes poised to follow in her mothers footsteps if she stays fixed at her side.
  Neutral
When Gloria insists that she can take care of herself, it is a charged statement, since she has made it explicitly clear that she is staying on her meds solely because it is in her daughters best interest.
  Positive
Otherwise, she finds no reason to take pills that dilute her days of vitality.
  Negative
I was reminded of the bipolar couple in  Paul Dalios terrific  Touched With Fire, who experience a powerful bond when they go off their meds together, while surrounded by the spirals of light from Van Goghs Starry Night.
  Positive
One senses that Gloria sees those same spirals as she lies on the floor, staring up at the stars on her ceiling.
  Negative
What Gloria doesnt realize is that she must be on her meds for nobody but herself if she truly wants to get better.
  Negative
Beth cannot fix her, she can only love her, and love isnt enough.
  Positive
Cinematographer  Jeffrey Waldron finds subtle ways of framing the women in a way that reverses their familial roles, such as when Beth drops Gloria off and waves from the drivers seat of her car, like a mom wishing her kid a good day at school.
  Negative
The performances Weiss elicits from her two leading ladies are nothing short of sublime.
  Negative
Davenport is adept at conveying tremendous feeling with the slightest flicker of longing or heartache that registers on her face.
  Positive
Shes well-matched with Manning, an actress unafraid of chewing the scenery, as evidenced on Orange Is the New Black.
  Negative
Such an approach wouldve been the wrong one for Gloria, and Manning wisely resists any semblance of caricature or crowd-pleasing quirkiness in her portrayal of the characters manic state.
  Negative
Glorias failed attempts at appearing stable while toiling away as a lunch lady, greeting students with overenthusiastic zeal, is painful to watch.
  Very negative
She nails the impulsiveness and restlessness that people with bipolar disorder experience, as well as the vacancy in their expressions when their minds are clouded by the haze of illness.
  Negative
Sometimes all you can do as a caregiver is wrap yourself around the person to prevent him or, in this case, her from harming himself, and that is precisely what Beth does during an especially frightening episode.
  Negative
These two people are so compelling and so fully realized that one could imagine a version of the film that was simply about them.
  Positive
Indeed, when Beth and Gloria are together, the rest of the world evaporates.
  Negative
When Beth attempts to remove them from their snug cocoon, suggesting that they dine inside a restaurant rather than order takeout and eat in their car, Gloria stubbornly resists.
  Negative
It is to the credit of the filmmakers that more characters are brought into the story in a way that doesnt feel forced, and none of them are the clichs they may appear to be at first glance.
  Negative
Beths crush, Jeremy  Carter Jenkins, has been deemed a social pariah by his peers, and has resigned to spend his high school days on the outskirts of town, for fear of having to engage with anyone.
  Very negative
Some of the films most amusing scenes occur at the ice cream parlor where Beth works.
  Positive
As she locks eyes with Jeremy, her smitten co-worker Evan Paglieri becomes increasingly jealous, and strives to shield her from a guy he believes is trouble the way Paglieri softly whimpers, I love you, after Beth leaves is priceless.
  Negative
Jeremys former lover, Daschulla  Maddie Hasson, is the closest thing the film has to a villain, but shes as wounded as anyone else onscreen, and her actions are ultimately directed at her father  Kurt Fuller, a psychiatrist who pays more attention to his patients than his own daughter.
  Negative
McMahon finds just the right note for each scene, never overwriting moments that couldve easily dribbled off into expositional overkill.
  Neutral
When Daschulla looks at her father and says, You didnt do anything, the line speaks volumes.
  Positive
A Light Beneath Their Feet is a triumph of empathetic filmmaking.
  Positive
It will enthrall viewers merely seeking a coming-of-age yarn, and it contains one of the loveliest prom scenes in recent memory.
  Positive
But for those viewers who, like myself, can personally relate to the story and have been forced to answer the same questions, the film will bring catharsis, tears and perhaps a few epiphanies.
  Positive
I didnt get this film so much as it got me.
  Positive
