The Founder is mesmerized by its hero, McDonalds chain founder Ray Kroc  Michael Keaton, but horrified by how he built his empire.
  Negative
That kind of ambivalence is great' in fact its a hallmark of good drama.
  Positive
But there are too many moments when The Founder becomes a business-drama variant of that war film problem identified by  Francois Truffaut: its hard to make a truly anti-war film because war is inherently cinematic, and when you show it, people get swept up in the action anyway.
  Negative
The bloodshed in the business drama is usually figurative, but the conflict is still thrilling, and so a lot of films about business end up grappling with Truffaut's war movie problem.
  Positive
Glengarry Glen Ross,  Wall Street, Wolf of Wall Street,  Boiler Room and the like are filled with the kinds of people you'd cross a room to avoid, yet you hear their lines quoted by businesspeople and b-school students as inspirational texts, probably because it's more fun to identify with the bastard who gets things done than the people who suffer from his actions.
  Very negative
Ray Kroc is a local Chamber of Commerce version of Gordon Gekko.
  Negative
Keaton plays him with such laser-beam focus that even when the movie is appalled by Ray's shady maneuvers, it still leans on his every word.
  Negative
As written by  Robert Siegel  The Wrestler, directed by  John Lee Hancock The Rookie and acted by Keaton, Kroc at first seems a riff on Death of a Salesman hero Willy Loman, or one of the real estate strivers in Glengarry Glen Ross who say they can't close deals because the leads are weak.
  Negative
We see him cold-calling restaurant owners and trying to sell them mixers out of the trunk of his car, then returning home to get pep talks from his wife Ethel  Laura Dern.
  Negative
By the end of the tale, hes become the Charles Foster Kane of hamburgers a bland megalomaniac surrounded by enablers and worshipers, ruling a corporation that he built by exploiting the optimism and trust of McDonalds originators Richard and Maurice McDonald  Nick Offerman and  John Carroll Lynch, who were bought out at a too-low price and robbed of future royalties after accepting a handshake agreement that Kroc never honored.
  Negative
The films depiction of the McDonald brothers is devastating, far and away the strongest thing in The Founder.
  Negative
Every stop on their road to ruin is flagged and catalogued, from their decision to let Kroc expand into other states to their capitulation to production and profit-making ideas that they fear will turn the restaurant from a profitable but self-contained labor of love into a purveyor of unfrozen beef patties and powdered shakes.
  Negative
The movie does such a good job of showing the brothers bond as a relationship founded on can-do spirit that when Kroc enters the picture, lavishing praise on their idea for a fast food restaurant with an assembly line service model, you can see why theyd quit resisting his vision of a centralized franchise.
  Positive
Up until to the point where documents get signed and large sums start changing hands, the film treats Kroc as a sad sack chasing one last shot at redemption, so were not surprised that the McDonald brothers would see that in him as well, and be moved to make his fairy tale and theirs they failed to build their own chain come true.
  Negative
Offerman and Lynch, two of the best character actors alive, top themselves here' each has several close-ups so filled with betrayal and regret that even the film seems awed by their power.
  Positive
Siegels script treats Kroc as the embodiment of a certain way of looking at American business values: smiley-faced positive, forever treating capitalism as a pure virtue that does so much good for society that its casualties are unimportant.
  Positive
On the road, Kroc repeats inspirational phrases he memorized from a self-help record.
  Positive
He believes in them as a cleric believes in a sacred text.
  Positive
His conversations with other characters are filled with formulations that you might hear from the mouth of a cult leader.
  Negative
Theyre bold and startling but also self-serving and cynical, as when he tells the brothers that he wants the McDonalds logo to be as ubiquitous as the American flag and the cross: The new American church  Feeding bodies, feeding souls.
  Negative
And yet despite his blatant opportunism, Kroc sees himself as an idealist and myth-maker, not a huckster.
  Negative
Hes not a knowingly evil person.
  Neutral
But theres a void at his center which, The Founder suggests, might be as much a requirement for legendary business success as the persistence that Kroc's self-help record keeps praising.
  Negative
An especially deft screenwriting touch: Kroc, who claims the McDonalds brothers food service concepts as his own and ultimately steals their name, is shown repeating the persistence speech in a business award speech without attribution.
  Negative
Unfortunately, The Founder often articulates its ideas in a tedious way, by having its characters deliver reams of exposition some of it aided by documentary footage and old photos in place of real conversations.
  Very negative
The first third of the film is so thick with slide-show storytelling that it plays like a celebratory video that could be screened at a convention of McDonalds franchisees.
  Negative
The film also has such trouble integrating the business story with Krocs tumultuous personal life he divorced Ethel for a younger woman named Joan  Linda Cardellini that its women end up being defined by their level of support for Krocs vision.
  Negative
The McDonald brothers are secondary characters, too, but theyre fleshed out as individuals.
  Negative
You can picture their lives apart from and before Kroc.
  Neutral
Thats not the case with Ethel a wet blanket, despite Dern's best efforts or Joan who likens Kroc to Alexander the Great not as a warning but as a compliment.
  Negative
Had "The Founder" focused solely on Krocs relationship with the McDonald brothers, it might have been one of the great intimate, sour character studies of recent times.
  Negative
All the stuff with Kroc on the road acting like a beleaguered  Jack Lemmon character and the scenes with his first wife nagging him and second-guessing him feel like attempts to will a three-dimensional, somewhat sympathetic biography into existence, even though the material resists it.
  Positive
The nagging suspicion that the filmmakers could not help but succumb to the charisma of Ray Kroc or Michael Keaton?
  Negative
lingers through the final stretch of The Founder, which tries to visualize a hypnotic emotional void in the spirit of  Raging Bull or  There Will Be Blood" without laying the proper groundwork for it.
  Negative
This film could have been titled There Will Be Beef.
  Negative
Still, Id be lying if I said I hadnt thought about "The Founder" constantly since seeing it.
  Positive
It's possible that a sharper, bleaker, more articulate film might not have resonated as strongly as this messy, self-canceling one.
  Negative
It's an ad that becomes a warning before circling around and becoming another, darker kind of advertisement, and one of the most intriguing and surprising things about "The Founder" is that, in the end, it seems vaguely ashamed of itself for letting this happen.
  Negative
Kroc steals the movie from Hancock and Siegel just like he stole McDonald's from the McDonald brothers.
  Positive
I guess you could say it stole my objections, too.
  Negative
I left the theater with a bad taste in my mouth.
  Negative
Then I went to McDonalds for the first time in over a year and ordered a Quarter Pounder with cheese and a vanilla shake.
  Negative
