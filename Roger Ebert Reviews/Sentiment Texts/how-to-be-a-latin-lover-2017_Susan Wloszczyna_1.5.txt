After niftily compressing more than a quarter-century of its central characters early life into a tidy five minutes and a handful of seconds before any opening credits flash by, How to Be a Latin Lover all too quickly devolves into a nearly two-hour slog showcasing Mexican comedy superstar  Eugenio Derbezs attempt to seduce U.S. audiences with a cheesy bilingual spoof of an ethnic stereotype long past its expiration date.
  Very negative
Do we really need a South of the Border answer to  Adam Sandler as a sort of Deuce Bigelow: Hispanic Gigolo?
  Negative
I vote no, even if the actor now and then flashes a bit of clownish panache as middle-aged gold-digger Maximo, who gets dumped by his abundantly wealthy -year-old wife  Renee Taylor in a Renee Taylor-made role for a younger model in the guise of dweeby  Michael Cera in a glorified cameo.
  Negative
When this tossed-out trophy husband protests that he should get half of everything, his soon-to-be ex reminds him that theres a prenuptial agreement.
  Negative
He counters that what he signed was actually something called a prenup.
  Negative
His confusion is not unlike those voters who didnt realize that the Affordable Care Act and Obamacare were one and the same and is just about as funny.
  Negative
Nor do we require a farce that might have been more appropriate as an outright R-rated romp but instead awkwardly chooses to be a PG- bring-the-kids outing.
  Neutral
Now-penniless, the mooch moves in with estranged sister Sara  Salma Hayek and decides to tutor his shy and fatherless -year-old nephew, Hugo  Raphael Alejandro, in the art of being a junior Casanova.
  Negative
Of course, Maximo has an ulterior motive: The kids grade-school crush has a rich widowed grandmother who just happens to look just like  Raquel Welch because she is Raquel Welch and he is determined to make her his next designated sugar mommy.
  Negative
That means we are subjected to questionable cross-generational humor of varying degrees of silliness and stupidity.
  Negative
On one side are blatantly childish shenanigans including poop and fart jokes as well as a running joke where Derbez pours both Capn Crunch cereal and milk directly into his mouth so he can avoid washing dishes.
  Negative
On the other side is much more suggestive humor as Maximo employs such pseudo-naughty euphemisms as poking and gives Hugo aka his Minimo a demonstration on how to do a sexy walk that will drive the ladies crazy.
  Negative
When his uncle explains that women who witness his strut will think, He must be great in bed, Hugo smiles as he brags, I AM great in bed.
  Positive
I dont pee or anything anymore.
  Neutral
Such wince-able tries at verbal ripostes might be why Derbez seems so fond of sight gags, such as Maximo regularly being on the receiving end of bodily abuse or the repeated spectacle of him waking up on his flattened leaky air mattress on his nephews bedroom floor.
  Negative
There is also a spa visit whose variation on manly defoliation is nowhere close to the classic scene in  The -Year-Old Virgin.
  Negative
To presumably better his chances of crossing over to English-speaking audiences, Derbez is joined by several Hollywood-bred second bananas including  Rob Corddry as Welchs wary chauffeur,  Rob Riggle and  Rob Huebel as two shady goons chasing after Maximo when he reneges on a business deal and  Kristen Bell as an overly cheery manager of a frozen yogurt shop whose clawed countenance bears the scars of being a crazy cat lady.
  Negative
But someone probably  Ken Marino, the " Wet Hot American Summer" star making his feature directing debut should have thought twice about bringing aboard  Rob Lowe as Derbezs frenemy of a fellow male strumpet, who provides arm candy for  Linda Lavins lascivious matron of means who likes to indulge in role playing.
  Negative
Not because there are already three other Robs in the cast, but because the onetime Brat Pack member clearly has perfected the knack of not taking himself too seriously.
  Negative
As a result, he upstages the films anxious-to-please lead at every turn.
  Negative
Posing as a pizza delivery guy, Lowe manages to milk a chuckle just by announcing that the box he is carrying holds one extra-large sausage.
  Negative
As for Hayek, she is always a welcome sight, even when wasted as a straight woman.
  Negative
But the movies pacing would have been better served without her overlong, alcohol-induced, song-and-dance number that comes out of nowhere and doesnt add much, save for proving her character needs to let her hair down.
  Negative
And dont get me started on the sexy walk-off featuring civilians on the street that ends the movie along with bloopers, natch.
  Negative
Ultimately, How to Be a Latin Lover doesnt know how to be a comedy at least not a  st century one that can get away with dopey double entendres while promoting the importance of family ties over money.
  Negative
Its hard to be a sincere heart-tugger when you are basically sexually harassing your own audience.
  Negative
Who knows?
  Neutral
Attendees just might have cause for a class-action suit.
  Negative
