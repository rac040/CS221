"Lone Survivor" burns with the fever of a passion project.
  Positive
Writer-director Peter Berg's gratitude to United States servicemen for all their sacrifice comes through viscerally, from first frame to last.
  Positive
The film opens with a long montage of real-life Navy SEALs in training and ends with a slide show of SEALs and soldiers living full, happy lives off-duty, set to an emotional power ballad.
  Very positive
What's in between amounts to " The Passion of the Christ" for U.S. servicemen: a bloody historic episode recounted mainly in images of hardy young men being ripped apart, at screeching volume.Though Berg's source material isn't the New Testament, he often handles Navy Seal Marcus Luttrell's account via ghostwriter Patrick Robinson of his doomed  reconnaissance mission with the thunderous reverence  Mel Gibson brought to Christ's crucifixion and resurrection.
  Negative
A veteran actor, Berg shows a much subtler touch with ensemble performances.
  Positive
Scenes of elite warriors busting each other's chops and joking through the terrifying moments of anticipation between battles capture the essence of jocular group chemistry.
  Negative
I'm thinking of the cocky FBI agents in Berg's "The Kingdom" and even the high school football players in " Friday  Night Lights".
  Negative
It's clear that he dug into the Average Joe details of Luttrell's book, with dialogue that encompasses the boys' love of the movie " Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy" and the newlywed jitters of Matthew Axelson  Ben Foster.
  Positive
Mark Wahlberg as Luttrell,  Taylor Kitsch as Lieutenant  Michael Murphy and  Emile Hirsch as Danny Dietz contribute natural charisma and intelligence under Berg's downright doting eye.
  Positive
The best example of this is an exquisitely controlled sequence in which the SEAL Team  members use an Afghan hill to surveil the compound of Taliban leader Ahmad Shah Yousuf Azami.
  Positive
Berg builds the tension by keeping our view restricted to the four Seals perched in their positions, barely camouflaged by low pine branches, and their point-of-view of the valley.
  Neutral
They chitchat as if they were back at the base to burn off their anxiety which, of course, heightens ours.
  Negative
Gradually, their geographic advantage becomes their trap.
  Negative
This slow transition from routine reconnaissance to insane firefight reminded me of a forest battle in John McTiernan's unlikely combat classic, " Predator".
  Negative
Of course, "Predator" was a sci-fi action flick, which meant that it could easily afford to let the tension explode into popcorn-friendly thrills.
  Negative
"Lone Survivor" has to negotiate with the truth.
  Positive
Berg is at heart an action director, so his way of restraining the urge to Rambo-fy his heroes in the interest of this film's patriotic agenda is to double down on their suffering.
  Neutral
Whenever one of the Seals gets shot, the sound effects make us intimate with the bullet's progress through flesh, bone and vital organs.
  Negative
The sound of a lung aspirating blood in ragged gasps has never been so vivid.
  Positive
Under a rain of projectiles, the Seals tumble down a roughly  degree jagged mountainside, smashing into giant rocks as they go, falling and flailing for so long, in a series of edits so gorgeously fluid, that I began to think about great experimental films but also that moment in " Eddie Murphy Delirious"  where Aunt Bunny took forever to fall down the stairs.
  Negative
Yet the men keep going.
  Neutral
Limbs fail or fall off, blood pours out, but so long as at least one eye can peer through a scope and one finger can reach the trigger, each soldier will fight to the death.
  Negative
From there, the film gets tipsy on heroism.
  Negative
Pashtun villagers hostile to the Taliban take Luttrell in, patch him up and defend him as if he were their own.
  Negative
They gently scrape away his panic and distrust, despite having no translator between them.
  Negative
As with "The Kingdom", the foreigner who stood by our American hero has an emotional moment with him, an exchange of glances and an embrace that communicates understanding between freedom fighters: Loyalty and courage have no national or tribal boundaries.
  Positive
Made with Luttrell as a close consultant to Berg, this film has a sincerity and sense of respect for the troops that shouldn't be confused with profundity.
  Positive
"Lone Survivor" means well, but what it has to say about the costs of modern warfare is nothing new or especially illuminating.
  Neutral
It's cut from the same cloth that was once fashioned into the  Pat Tillman legend and the  Saving Private Lynch saga, honoring sacrifice in imagery that the American war machine can easily fashion into a recruitment commercial.
  Negative
"Lone Survivor" makes political interests superfluous to the religion of the warrior, which is all about enduring whatever hardship is thrown at you while protecting the brother at your side.
  Negative
What this story really curses is all the faulty equipment and poor operational planning that imperiled Luttrell and his brothers.
  Negative
They fret over broken radios, phones and unavailable helicopters.
  Negative
Never mind about Academy members voting on this one early next year: let's see how many Congress members have seen "Lone Survivor" the next time a bill to expand defense spending is on the table.
  Negative
