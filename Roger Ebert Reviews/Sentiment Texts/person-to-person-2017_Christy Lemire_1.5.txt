Various characters populate Person to Person, but they rarely register as actual people.
  Negative
And while some of their storylines intersect throughout the course of a day in New York, they rarely connect in ways that have actual meaning.
  Positive
So whats left?
  Neutral
A solid cast whose talents mostly go to waste and a movie that meanders from one moment to the next without much momentum.
  Negative
But if youre in the mood for something shaggy and loose that wont challenge you too much, maybe youll enjoy writerdirector  Dustin Guy Defas affectionate and sporadically sweet indie.
  Positive
Its got a low-key rhythm that might provide a pleasing alternative to the noisy spectacle of summer blockbusters.
  Positive
Or it might just seem pointless.
  Neutral
At times, Person to Person recalls of  Richard Linklaters groundbreaking  film  Slacker, in that it ambles amiably between oddballs over an ordinary afternoon.
  Negative
And Defa is definitely going for a s vibe here' besides shooting on grainy mm, his penchant for zooms and nostalgia for vinyl, bicycles, newspapers and antique watches give the movie an overall throwback quality.
  Positive
But such comparisons only make you long for characters that are more sharply drawn and dialogue thats more vivid.
  Negative
The chief through line of Person to Person features  Bene Coopersmith, who also starred in Defas  short film which inspired the feature, as a record aficionado pursuing a rare Charlie Parker album and pondering whether to tell his girlfriend how he really feels about her.
  Negative
Coopersmith owns a Brooklyn record store in real life, and his presence gives the movie a consistent feeling of authenticity.
  Positive
His character, also named Bene, asks everyone he sees that day whether they like his new shirt: a flowery purple button-down thats way outside his comfort zone.
  Negative
Its one of the movies many self-conscious quirks.
  Neutral
Then theres  Michael Cera as an investigative reporter running around town with his new trainee  Abbi Jacobson.
  Neutral
How quaint is that?
  Neutral
Working journalists!
  Positive
Its her first day on the job, and Ceras nerdy Phil makes Jacobsons mousy Claire stalk and shout questions at the widow of a man who died suspiciously.
  Negative
As the bereaved wife,  Michaela Watkins gets little more to do than vamp around town in oversized sunglasses' shes like a femme fatale whos stumbled in from a broader comedy.
  Negative
Meanwhile, Phil strains to bond with Claire by blaring tunes for her from his terrible metal band.
  Negative
Its yet another quirk.
  Positive
The great  Philip Baker Hall brings an understated grace to his brief screen time as a longtime watch repairman' he happens to have the timepiece the dead man was wearing when his body was found, which makes it of great interest to Phil and Claire.
  Very positive
But hed rather just hang out in his quiet shop all day, listening as his garrulous buddy a charismatic Isiah Whitlock Jr. tells tall tales.
  Negative
Teen tastemaker-turned-actress  Tavi Gevinson anchors yet another storyline as a hyperverbal high school student who ditches class with her best friend  Olivia Luccardi, only to be stuck doing nothing while the pal makes out with her idiot boyfriend.
  Negative
I detest the way you detest people, Luccardis Melanie says.
  Negative
I know, Gevinsons Wendy responds, and I love you for that.
  Positive
Gevinson has a directness thats appealing.
  Positive
And in the least developed and least amusing section of all, Benes roommate, Ray  George Sample III, tries to atone for posting a sex tape of his girlfriend online in a fit of revenge.
  Negative
Weirdly, the movie asks us to sympathize with him for this transgression.
  Negative
It also asks us to accept that he doesnt understand how the Internet works, which seems strange given his youth, although it is consistent with the movies prevailing analog tone.
  Positive
The one theme that unites these disparate strands is that their characters have difficulty connecting with each other.
  Neutral
Theres often a stiffness to the way they regard each other, or perhaps theyll have stilted exchanges about hometowns or donuts in an effort to make small talk.
  Negative
Trouble is, audiences might struggle to make a genuine emotional connection with Person to Person themselves.
  Negative
