Youll never know how good the first three  Diary of a Wimpy Kid movies were until youre forced to see the fourth one.
  Negative
And its not just because Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul has a whole new cast, although that is one in a series of contributing factors in its inferiority.
  Positive
Its been five years since the last movie, Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days, so finding new actors was a necessity in the series perpetual middle-school setting.
  Positive
But the previous cast  Zachary Gordon,  Devon Bostick,  Steve Zahn and  Rachael Harris brought a level of humanity to the zany proceedings that kept them relatable and grounded.
  Negative
Dog Days even featured some legitimate, father-son drama.
  Negative
Bostick in particular brought a wonderfully weird, subversive vibe to his big-brother bully character, Rodrick.
  Positive
And while none of the previous films fully captured the spirit of the popular  Jeff Kinney books that inspired them a silly and smart mix of cynicism and heart they came way closer than this new installment does.
  Positive
Of course, theres an intentionally over-the-top quality to the comedy in both the movies and the source material.
  Negative
With their conspiratorial antics and minimalist sketches, Kinneys books are about kids, for kids, in the most awkward and angst-ridden time in their young lives.
  Negative
Although my son has read them all and loves them, even though hes only .
  Negative
Maybe hes planning early for the misery of puberty.
  Negative
The Long Haul, which returning director  David Bowers co-wrote with Kinney himself shockingly, jettisons everything thats honest and worthwhile about the books in favor of hackneyed misadventures and gross-out scatological humor.
  Negative
And thats before the Heffley family inadvertently adopts a baby pig from a country fair.
  Negative
It is a tried-and-true premise, the wacky family road trip, but The Long Haul breathes no new life into it.
  Neutral
From weirdoes on the highways and woeful motels with empty pools to kitschy roadside attractions and calamitous off-road detours, you have seen this all before.
  Negative
Many, many times.
  Neutral
This material had long seemed stale when the  Vacation reboot came out in .
  Negative
Bowers slapstick tone and frantic pacing strain desperately to create an escalating sense of giddy mayhem, but the result feels like a lot of wheel-spinning.
  Negative
This time, the Heffleys pack up the minivan to celebrate their Meemaws  th birthday, taking place somewhere in Indiana.
  Positive
Mom Susan now played by  Alicia Silverstone, who isnt nearly nerdy enough wants the family to bond, so she outlaws electronic devices and insists on card games and sing-alongs.
  Positive
If you didnt already have a powerful urge to run from the theater, the familys totally sincere rendition of the  Spice Girls Wannabe surely will provide the final push you need.
  Negative
But dad Frank  Tom Everett Scott secretly still has work to do.
  Positive
The eponymous wimpy kid, Greg a likable Jason Drucker, tries to sneak in time playing his favorite video game, Twisted Wizard, on his phone.
  Positive
And rocker older brother Rodrick played as a much dimmer bulb by  Charlie Wright wants to bang his head to the music of his terrible metal band, Loded Diper.
  Negative
The youngest Heffley child, Manny Dylan and Wyatt Walters, makes shrieky noises of his own every time his pacifier falls out of his mouth.
  Very negative
Such concern over the detrimental, cumulative effects of prolonged screen time couldnt be more relevant.
  Negative
And trust me, the struggle is real.
  Positive
But The Long Haul reduces these figures especially the parents to shrill stereotypes, as flimsy as their stick-figure renderings on the page.
  Negative
Greg and Rodrick figure out a way to satisfy their needs by reprogramming the GPS and taking the family closer to Indianapolis, where there just happens to be a video game convention the same weekend.
  Negative
Greg figures if he can post a video of himself meeting his gamer idol an obnoxious  Joshua Hoover, he can live down the Internet infamy hes achieved in an unfortunate meme.
  Negative
Its a complicated attempt to contemporize the book dont ask.
  Neutral
And Rodrick thinks he can play some drumming video game and win some money.
  Neutral
Needless to say, nothing goes as planned.
  Negative
But along the way, there are plenty of poop, pee and vomit jokes courtesy of copious sticks of fried butter and a spinning amusement park ride.
  Negative
There is the aforementioned pig, who ends up being the cleverest character of all.
  Negative
And out of nowhere, there is a lengthy and lovingly crafted homage to the shower scene in Psycho.
  Negative
Its the only segment the film critics in the audience at my screening enjoyed.
  Positive
The downside of this is that youll have to have a potentially uncomfortable conversation in the car with your kids on the way home, explaining the importance of Psycho.
  Negative
The upside is that youll get to talk about Psycho instead of The Long Haul which should improve your own haul significantly.
