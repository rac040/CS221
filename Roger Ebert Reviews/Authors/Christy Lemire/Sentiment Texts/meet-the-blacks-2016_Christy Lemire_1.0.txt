These and many more are among the varied and random celebrities and pop-culture phenomena Meet the Blacks mentions during a running time that feels longer than its mere  minutes.
  Negative
Even by the standards of raunchy, comic spoofs, director and co-writer  Deon Taylors film feels especially scattered.
  Positive
Its as if he and co-writer  Nicole DeMasi sat in a room, made a long list of movies, TV shows and famous people, then brought it to the set and had the actors come up with improvised bits in which they drop them here and there.
  Negative
There also may have been some legitimate, relevant intent: Our lead actress looks like  Sofia Vergara lets just mention the name Sofia Vergara' thatll be good for a laugh!
  Negative
We got  Mike Tyson to do a cameo, and hes willing to play a deranged party clown and wear a silly wig!
  Negative
But still, lets do an ear-biting joke anyway.
  Neutral
Just cause, you know, its Mike Tyson.
  Negative
It very well might have gone down this way.
  Neutral
You may find your mind wandering toward such theories during Meet the Blacks, given that the movie itself is so shaggy and shambling and not in a pleasingly lived-in, Richard-Linklater kind of way.
  Negative
Just in a messy, incoherent way.
  Negative
On its most basic level, Meet the Blacks is a spoof of  The Purge, the  thriller about a near-future America thats peaceful and crime-free because one night a year, everyone is allowed to go on a murdering, thieving rampage of catharsis.
  Negative
But it puts a racial spin supposedly for satirical purposes on a movie that already was a satire of societys ills.
  Negative
Meet the Blacks doesnt have much to say, though, and doesnt say it with much bite.
  Negative
Mike Epps stars as Carl Black, who moves his family from a poor and violent section of Chicago to a wealthy enclave of Beverly Hills.
  Negative
The gated subdivision is actually called Blanco Cielo, or White Sky.
  Negative
Even the security guard at the front gate, whos also black, doesnt believe Carl belongs there.
  Negative
Im the new n-word who lives here!
  Positive
Carl angrily insists.
  Neutral
Others questioning his familys presence include the overzealous neighborhood watch guy an uncomfortable thing to joke about and the super WASPs next door, Jim and Mary Smith.
  Negative
Its a little ironic that your name is Black, says the chirpy Mary, in what becomes a repeated and not particularly funny joke.
  Negative
But as it turns out, in addition to his wiring business, Carl can afford to live in a faux French Normandy McMansion because he stole a bunch of cash and weed from a drug dealer named Key Flo  Charlie Murphy.
  Negative
Then he dashed across the country with his family: his stereotypically sexy Latina wife, Lorena  Zulay Henao' sassy teenage daughter, Allie  Bresha Webb' quirky son, Carl Jr.
  Positive
Alex Henderson' and creepy ex-con cousin, Cronut Lil Duval.
  Negative
An aside: Everyone refers to Carl Jr. throughout as Carls Jr., like the fast-food chain, which isnt exactly hilarious the first time.
  Negative
The Blacks white, racist neighbors use the opportunity of the annual purge which  George Lopez kicks off on live television as a character named President El Bama to force them to move out or just kill them outright.
  Negative
If this is going to be your premise whites killing blacks out of a sense of snobbery and intolerance your humor better be pretty sharp and sophisticated.
  Positive
Instead, Meet the Blacks which wasnt shown to critics before opening day gives us fart jokes and tired pop-culture callbacks like: Whatchu talkin bout, Willis?
  Negative
Its also sloppily made from a basic production standpoint: poorly lit and bafflingly edited with the uncomfortable vibe of awkward improv and spotty sound that renders several lines incomprehensible.
  Very negative
Although maybe that isnt such a bad thing.
  Negative
At the same time, Meet the Blacks takes some quick detours that are so strange, theyre almost fascinating.
  Negative
The Tyson appearance is one of them.
  Neutral
And the movie as a whole is such an incompetent train wreck, you cant look away, just to see how much worse it can get.
  Very negative
But every once in a while it seems to be trying, slightly, to make a vague point about racial prejudices and tensions.
  Negative
When a group of white neighbors stands outside the Blacks front door during the purge, wearing masks and carrying weapons, their leader goes on a vicious tirade about how unwelcome they are.
  Negative
But when he drops an n-bomb in the middle of it, everyone agrees hes gone too far even the guy who uttered the slur himself.
  Negative
Mostly, though, Meet the Blacks is too scatterbrained to be so self-aware.
