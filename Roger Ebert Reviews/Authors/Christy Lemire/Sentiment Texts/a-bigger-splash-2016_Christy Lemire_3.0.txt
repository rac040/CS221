Simultaneously lush and lurid, sumptuous and startling, A Bigger Splash never goes where you expect, even as its undercurrent of danger is unmistakable from the start.
  Positive
With the follow-up to his landmark  drama  I Am Love, director  Luca Guadagnino once again reveals himself to be a master craftsman.
  Positive
He draws four beautiful and well-balanced performances from his excellent cast, including brash, grandiose work from  Ralph Fiennes.
  Very positive
What Fiennes does here feels like jazz itself: Its physical and primal, jumpy and funny in equal measure, and he manages to make an annoying, demanding character thoroughly entertaining.
  Positive
At the other end of the spectrum is a fascinating, wordless performance from  Tilda Swinton, the exquisite star of I Am Love.
  Very positive
She croaks out a whisper here and there and even a silent orgasm, standing up which only adds to her perpetually mysterious air.
  Negative
She does so much with those clear, blue eyes, that statuesque presence and the confidence she exudes no matter what shes wearing or even when shes wearing nothing at all, which frequently is the case for all the films stars.
  Positive
Rounding out the foursome are  Matthias Schoenaerts as Swintons hunky, younger lover and Dakota Johnson as the slinky, seductive daughter Fiennes character only recently realized he had.
  Negative
Their lengthy backstories and newfound alliances reveal themselves over the course of a seemingly idyllic vacation at a picturesque villa on the Italian island of Pantelleria, where the threat of a sirocco stirring things up even further is constant.
  Very negative
Cinematographer Yorick Le Saux who also shot Guadagninos gorgeous I Am Love luxuriates in them all as they bask and tangle in the sun and in and out of a swimming pool that will become increasingly crucial as the film progresses.
  Positive
A Bigger Splash is a loose remake of the  Jacques Deray film La piscine.
  Negative
Schoenaerts pecs, Johnsons torso, Fiennes smile and even Swintons feet are all monuments to be worshipped as much as the cool, blue Mediterranean Sea or the imposing volcanic boulders that surround it.
  Negative
Swinton stars as Marianne Lane, a Bowie-esque rock star whom we first glimpse in metallic sequins and face paint, taking the stage to the deafening chants of an adoring stadium crowd.
  Negative
But soon, its clear that shes forcing herself not to speak much less sing' she and Schoenaerts Paul, a photographer and documentarian, have retreated to this remote paradise to allow Marianne to rest and recover her voice.
  Negative
Guadagnino, working from a script by  David Kajganich, efficiently and vividly establishes the bohemian yet domesticated life Marianne and Paul have created for themselves, full of nude sunbathing, midday lovemaking and long soaks in the nearby mud baths.
  Positive
The noisy, unexpected arrival of Fiennes Harry, Mariannes longtime friend and record producer, interrupts their reverie.
  Positive
Turns out Harry not only was Mariannes lover for six years, hes also the man who introduced her to Paul and gave them his blessing to launch into their own romance a decision he now regrets.
  Negative
Harry has shown up with the blonde, leggy Penelope Johnson, who alternates between making insults and inappropriate come-ons.
  Negative
She insists shes  although her impetuousness suggests otherwise, and A Bigger Splash allows Johnson to be both funnier and sexier than she was in  Fifty Shades of Grey.
  Positive
Tensions mount as the days pass, the wind blows harder and dustier and the villa seems to grow smaller and more suffocating.
  Negative
Harry breaks through all that, though or perhaps hes just oblivious by inviting random friends over, regaling them with tales of his rock-music glory days, playing Rolling Stones records and showing off his moves like Jagger.
  Neutral
This sequence may actually be the highlight in a movie filled with strong and striking visuals: the sight of Fiennes in an unbuttoned shirt and swim trunks joyously letting Emotional Rescue radiate from every fiber in his being.
  Positive
Hes never been so much fun to watch not even when he got to vamp it up as Voldemort.
  Negative
Guadagnino ratchets up the feeling of claustrophobia with extreme close-ups that ignite the senses: hands gutting a fish or peeling fruit, eyes as they survey the other characters, a mouth moving with non-stop chatter and laughter.Marianne could easily be a contemporary rock-star Swinton is a timeless and towering figure, after all but Guadagninos use of zooms and pans suggests an homage to European psychological dramas like the films source material.
  Positive
Hes created a concoction thats sexy and strange all at once.
  Positive
But then A Bigger Splash goes slack and silly toward the end, just as it should be at its most gripping.
  Negative
A ghastly discovery almost seems like its being played for laughs.
  Negative
In fact, because the film is so precise for long in both its beauty and its weirdness, the tonal shift toward uncomfortable farce feels that much more disappointing.
  Negative
Guadagnino also tries to drop in hints about the plight of Tunisian refugeesarriving on the island seeking sanctuary but they never really resonate or cohere with the story as a whole.
  Negative
A Bigger Splash might be intended as a cautionary tale about the perils of being white, beautiful and privileged but itll probably register more as a dazzling escape.
  Positive
