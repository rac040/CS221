Horror anthologies are hit-and-miss efforts by nature, with some short films in a collection working far more effectively than others, depending on your tastes.
  Negative
You cant please all of the people all of the time, right?
  Neutral
But XX feels unusually frustrating in its inconsistency, given its inspired premise.
  Negative
Four women directed four short horror films, each with a woman at its center.
  Neutral
Each stakes out a very different space within the genre from a wide variety of perspectives and voices.
  Positive
Its a great idea, especially since the horror field tends to be so male-dominated.
  Positive
While each segment has its moments, though, none of them are completely satisfying, and only one of them truly comes close to hitting its intended target.
  Negative
There may be a vague through line about upending the traditional female roles of mother, wife and caretaker, but if XX is trying to make some sort of statement, its not doing so with much clarity or power.
  Negative
Actually, the interstitials that serve as the films creepy connective tissue are the best parts of all.
  Positive
The work of Mexican stop-motion animation artist Sofia Carrillo, they feature disturbing images of doll parts moving about on their own in a dilapidated mansion.
  Negative
Hands crawl around, eyes blink open and closed and moths flutter menacingly.
  Negative
Eventually, its clear that they dont have much to do with the shorts themselves, but theyre vividly tactile and beautifully eerie.
  Positive
We begin with  The Box from director  Jovanka Vuckovic, based on a short story by Jack Ketchum.
  Negative
A mother  Natalie Brown takes her young son  Peter DaCunha and daughter  Peyton Kennedy into Manhattan for a day of fun just before Christmas.
  Positive
On the train ride home, the boy takes a peek inside a shiny, red gift box a fellow passenger is holding' what he sees quietly stuns him.
  Positive
Once they return to their suburban idyll, he refuses to eat, politely insisting hes not hungry but whatever is eating him slowly spreads throughout the family.
  Negative
Vuckovics film is moody and filled with dread, and she sharply depicts the ways in which a husband and wife can be at odds with each other over how to handle a family crisis.
  Negative
But The Box ultimately leaves you hanging, despite spelling out in narration the mothers obvious sense of loss and confusion.
  Negative
Next up is the quirkiest and most ambitious of the four films in its contrast of tones.
  Positive
The Birthday Party from Annie Clark better known as the musician St. Vincent stars the always-lovely  Melanie Lynskey as a harried mother named Mary.
  Negative
She thinks shes planned the perfect birthday party for her -year-old daughter  Sanai Victoria.
  Neutral
But something is clearly off, despite the chic, immaculate nature of Marys midcentury-modern home.
  Negative
Her brooding nanny  Sheila Vand puts her further on edge with her mere presence.
  Negative
But then, making matters significantly worse, Mary finds her husband dead in his study and Clark plays it all as high farce.
  Negative
As Mary scurries to hide the body, Clark amps up the dark comedy within this surreal situation with jump scares and her own overbearing score.
  Negative
Its a nightmarish vision of domestic comfort full of overbearing neighbors and an unsettling use of slow motion.
  Negative
But while its amusing here and there, it never quite clicks.
  Negative
The third segment, writerdirector  Roxanne Benjamins Dont Fall, is the most traditional, straight-up horror film of the series, but its also the weakest link.
  Very positive
Four friends go on a camping trip in the desert, with the two obnoxious men alternating between playing unwanted pranks on their female companions and mansplaining everything to them.
  Negative
But in the middle of the night, one of the women  Breeda Wool ventures off on her own to investigate a strange sound, with gruesomely bloody results.
  Negative
Dont Fall features some visceral creature effects especially given what must have been the films meager budget but we never get to know the characters enough to care about their fates.
  Negative
It ultimately feels like a decently made but rather empty genre exercise.
  Negative
But XX ends strong with Her Only Living Son from the most established of the four filmmakers,  Karyn Kusama, whose  The Invitation was a horror highlight last year.
  Negative
Christina Kirk stars as Cora, a single mom living with her teenage son, Andy  Kyle Allen, in a modest house in the middle of nowhere.
  Negative
She struggles to support them as a waitress, and they have little contact with the outside world besides her work and his school.
  Positive
She routinely rejects the friendly overtures from her handsome mailman  Mike Doyle' its clear she lives only for her son.
  Positive
But as Andy turns , the true nature of who he is and why they live such an austere, cloistered existence begins revealing itself in dark, chilling fashion.
  Positive
This is the best-made, strongest acted and most cohesive of the four shorts.
  Very positive
Its the only one thats truly, deeply disturbing.
  Negative
And it has the clearest thematic execution in its depiction of maternal sacrifice.
  Negative
