Think of How to Be Single as a cinematic Whitmans Sampler: There are enough pieces that work to offset the pieces that dont.
  Negative
And pieces really is the key word here, because this romantic comedy about the dating adventures of young people in the big city feels like it consists of several bits scattered about and then loosely tied together.
  Negative
Cohesively, its just a snip or two away from those insipid  Garry Marshall ensemble comedies that come out around various holidays.
  Negative
And on this Valentines Day, its certainly preferable to his  film Valentines Day.
  Positive
One subplot here seems so disconnected from all the others, it could have been eliminated entirely and not made much of a difference to the central story.
  Negative
From a tonal perspective, though, director  Christian Ditter pulls off a pretty tricky feat in balancing the films pervasive bawdiness with moments of real substance and heart.
  Positive
And hes got such a winning cast including  Dakota Johnson,  Rebel Wilson,  Leslie Mann,  Jake Lacy,  Damon Wayans Jr. and  Anders Holm that the whole experience ends up being way more enjoyable than you might expect.
  Positive
Loosely based on the novel by  Liz Tuccillo, co-author of Hes Just Not That Into You, How to Be Single follows several characters and their romantic entanglements or their strenuous efforts to avoid them.
  Negative
At the start, we see Johnsons character, sweet and shy Alice, insisting to her longtime boyfriend at Wesleyan, Josh  Nicholas Braun, that they should see what its like to date other people before settling comfortably into a lifetime of monogamy together.
  Positive
Then its off to that hotbed of singledom known as New York City, where Alice accepts a job as a paralegal at a prestigious law firm and quickly sparks up a friendship with the brashly confident and unapologetically promiscuous Robin Rebel Wilson, who takes Alice under her wing and teaches her  how to be single.
  Negative
Hence the title.
  Neutral
This means random, late-night hookups with Tom Anders Holm, the flirty party boy who owns the local bar, but also the possibility of something more substantial with handsome and successful single dad David Damon Wayans Jr., whom she meets at an alumni mixer.
  Neutral
One of the best parts of the script from  Abby Kohn amp'  Marc Silverstein Hes Just Not That Into You and  Dana Fox  Couples Retreat although those previous films theoretically wouldnt provide much cause for optimism is the way that it judges none of the characters for their sexual choices.
  Negative
Robin, who proudly proclaims that her apartment is just a place where she goes to shower in the morning after staying out all night, is having the best time of everyone in this movie and everyone in Manhattan, for that matter.
  Positive
And, not to give away how any of these story lines turn out, its rather refreshing to find that not everyone ends up coupled up and happy.
  Positive
Some end up alone and happy.
  Positive
There are actual permutations and unpredictable outcomes here.
  Positive
Also in the mix are Alices sister, Meg Leslie Mann, a fiercely independent obstetrician who insists she doesnt want a baby of her own until she does and the adorably goofy Ken Jake Lacy, with whom shes reluctant to get involved because hes so much younger.
  Negative
And if youre keeping score at home, yes, its a bit distracting that Johnson and Mann are  years apart but theyre supposed to be sisters' having said that, the two actresses also share several scenes together that radiate real warmth and tenderness.
  Positive
Which brings us to the one piece that doesnt really fit: a subplot involving  Alison Brie as Lucy, whos scientifically broken down all the online dating services in hopes of marrying the perfect man.
  Negative
Shes sort of a preppy, Type A-clich, which is intentional and which is supposed to make her potential romantic connection with Tom such a surprise.
  Negative
Her entire existence in his bar, which is directly beneath her apartment, consists of using it for free Wi-Fi and meeting bad blind dates there.
  Neutral
The fact that Brie makes this crazy-eyed character tolerable is a testament to the likability of her presence.
  Neutral
But theres really nothing that ties her to the rest of the narrative, which renders her a bit of an afterthought.
  Negative
When Lucy shows up at Alices rooftop birthday party with yet another would-be soul mate  Jason Mantzoukas, enjoyably odd as always, its like: How does she even know Alice?
  Negative
Theyve never had a single conversation.
  Neutral
Did everybody who hangs out at the bar get an Evite?
  Negative
Thats the tough part, though, of telling a story with an ensemble cast and giving everyone time to shine.
  Positive
It would have been lovely to see more of Wayans Jr., as well although he gets one brief scene toward the absolute end thats just devastating.
  Negative
You will sob.
  Neutral
And its earned.
  Positive
At the films center, though, Johnson serves as our sweetly relatable guide through a sea of big personalities a woman in her early s who questions both her loneliness and the need to be someones girlfriend.
  Negative
As in  Fifty Shades of Grey, Johnson once again reveals a naturalism on camera thats magnetic, and a keen sense of sly comic timing.
  Positive
Director Christian Ditter, meanwhile, displays a surprising amount of artistry in depicting her journey: He creates the sensation that were watching one long, fluid process as Alice moves into her tiny Brooklyn apartment, piece by piece.
  Positive
And when she descends a fire escape staircase to catch a quiet moment alone during her birthday party, it looks as if shes floating on the night sky.
  Negative
Like  Sex and the City, which will surely come to mind as youre watching this, How to Be Single exists in a magical New York City full of stylish wardrobes and sprawling apartments but there are worse places to visit, especially on a holiday weekend in February.
