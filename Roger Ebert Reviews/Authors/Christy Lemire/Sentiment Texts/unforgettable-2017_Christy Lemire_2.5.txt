Theres trash, and then theres good trash.
  Negative
Unforgettable falls into the latter category.
  Negative
Slick, glossy and radiating juicy villainy, it knows exactly what kind of movie it is and goes for it with giddy abandon.
  Positive
The story of two beautiful women embroiled in a battle over the same blandly handsome man, its not a complete parody of the hair-pulling sexual thriller that was a staple of guilty-pleasure cinema in the late s and early s and had a revival with s Obsessed.
  Negative
But veteran producer  Denise Di Novi  Heathers,  The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants  Crazy, Stupid, Love, directing for the first time, takes this premise right to the border of knowing camp and delights in letting it simmer there.
  Positive
Im not saying its good.
  Negative
But Ill admit that I had a good time.
  Positive
And a good deal of that has to do with the performance from  Katherine Heigl as a scorned divorcee out for revenge against her ex-husbands new love.
  Positive
With her statuesque frame, platinum mane and icy stares, Heigl dominates her every scene in ways that are hilarious, frightening and hilariously frightening.
  Positive
Finally, this is the perfect use of her commanding on-screen presence' playing rom-com heroines in movies like  Dresses,  The Ugly Truth and Life As We Know It always seemed like a poor fit.
  Neutral
But its hard to ignore the fact that the depiction of both Heigls character, Tessa, and  Rosario Dawsons Julia seems uncomfortably outdated.
  Negative
Unforgettable portrays these women as vicious rivals, both seeking the love and approval of a rich hunk to make them feel validated, complete.
  Positive
But the script from  Christina Hodson finds room to explore the origins of their insecurities as well as their feminine strength.
  Positive
And the depiction of perfect, judgmental mommies in a predominately white, wealthy, Pasadena-like town in Southern California isnt too far off.
  Negative
Mostly, though, Unforgettable is just nutty.
  Neutral
This much is clear early on, when Julia cuts into her going-away cake as she prepares to leave the San Francisco online publishing company where she works.
  Negative
Di Novi takes the time to linger on the giant blade as it slices into the letter L in her name.
  Negative
We already know that a murder has taken place: Julias ex-boyfriend, whose abuse drove her to seek a restraining order and a new life, is now dead.
  Very negative
But while the actual whodunit isnt all that intriguing, the performances and the production values elevate this familiar, tawdry material.
  Positive
Julia wants to leave her troubles behind and start over with her fianc, David  Geoff Stults, whose chief desirable attribute seems to be that hes even-tempered.
  Negative
Theres not much to him.
  Neutral
But if hes a Ken doll, his ex, Tessa is psycho Barbie, as one character describes her.
  Negative
This is the kind of movie in which people are constantly explaining themselves to each other and explaining each other to each other.
  Positive
The expository dialogue may be clunky, but the zingers are choice.
  Negative
Also not terribly subtle is the fact that Tessa and Julia are complete opposites, although the wardrobe selections from costume designer  Marian Toy make that clear in inspired ways.
  Negative
Tessa is all stick-straight hair and monochromatic, form-fitting sheaths.
  Negative
Shes an equestrian, and she rides her horse with intense purpose.
  Positive
Julia, meanwhile, is all flowy, dark curls and boho-chic sundresses.
  Negative
Shes a former smoker with a hearty laugh.
  Positive
Unforgettable never specifically addresses the fact that Julia is the only person of color in this idyllic, small town, but you can feel the implicit racism in the way Tessa and her prickly posse size her up with disdain.
  Negative
Dawsons earthiness keeps the film from spiraling out of control into soapy territory, and shes afforded the few, rare instances of genuine emotion here.
  Positive
She may actually betoogood.
  Positive
Anyway, Julia joins David and his sweet, -year-old daughter, Lily  Isabella Kai Rice, in the familys stately, Spanish-style house in the hills.
  Negative
Veteran cinematographer  Caleb Deschanel gives all the interiors a creamy sheen thats positively Nancy Meyers-worthy.
  Negative
A former Wall Street financial guru, David is now pursuing his dream of launching a microbrewery' uptight Tessa was never impressed with that plan, but fun-loving Julia is down for whatever.
  Negative
And its that obvious, vibrant connection between the two of them that makes Tessa seethe with jealousy.
  Negative
No bunnies get boiled in Unforgettable, but Tessa does engage in some elaborate, high-tech trickery.
  Negative
Her increasingly and awesomely ludicrous antics eventually result in the return of Julias ex-boyfriend  Simon Kassianides, albeit in rather distasteful fashion.
  Negative
Its all laughs for us, at least until then.
  Positive
But none of the men here are nearly as interesting as the women.
  Negative
Besides Heigl and Dawson,  Cheryl Ladd is just deliciously evil as Tessas Botoxed and perfectly coifed mother, who will stop at nothing to ensure her daughters happiness.
  Negative
Ladd gets some of the films most prime, passive-aggressive lines Oh, you didnt bake the scones?
  Negative
but her characters incessant nitpicking also provides a window into what messed Tessa up so badly.
  Negative
And comedian  Whitney Cummings does more with the obligatory, wisecracking-best-friend role than you might expect.
  Negative
None of it is terribly memorable.
  Negative
But its fun while it lasts.
  Positive
