Like the novel Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, the movie Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is predicated on a simple, single gimmick: Its  Pride and Prejudice  with zombies.
  Negative
This is a vaguely amusing idea which somehow got stretched out to an entire book, which somehow became a best seller, which inevitably means it had to be made into a film.
  Negative
It is essentially  Jane Austens classic tale of social mores and machinations in  th century England, down to characters, settings, plot points and specific bits of dialogue, only with the pesky inclusion of the undead popping up here and there to complicate matters further authorship for the project goes cheekily to both Austen and  Seth Grahame-Smith.
  Very negative
While the  book played this genre mash-up for dry, sly laughs, writer-director  Burr Steers film amps up the thrills and gore.
  Positive
And thats a problem not necessarily as a narrative choice, but from a technical perspective.
  Negative
What differentiates Pride and Prejudice and Zombies from its literary source material is its big action sequences, but theyre staged, lit, shot and edited in such muddled fashion, its often difficult to tell whats going on.
  Very negative
Theres no visual context to the assaults and no way to determine their source or size, which depletes these scenes of their tension, making it impossible to become engaged.
  Negative
Sometimes this is intentional, as in Steers frequent use of blurriness right at the point of when a zombie is about to devour someone, but it doesnt work in those instances, either.
  Negative
Too often, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is so darkened as to be inscrutable, as in a basement scene when the Bennet sisters are bantering while sparring in preparation for the next possible attack t he women have to worry about both marrying the right man and not being eaten.
  Negative
In case its been a while since you read the book in high school English class: Pride and Prejudice centers on headstrong Elizabeth Bennet  Lily James, the second-oldest of five daughters of average means whos not nearly so obsessed with marrying up as her mother  Sally Phillips is.
  Negative
While her beautiful older sister, Jane  Bella Heathcote, becomes romantically involved with the handsome and obscenely wealthy Mr. Bingley  Douglas Booth, Lizzie enters into a love-hate relationship with Bingleys close friend, the even more obscenely wealthy Mr. Darcy  Sam Riley.
  Negative
Social classes clash and sparks fly.
  Positive
Misunderstandings arise but eventually clear up, characters are forced to admit to both their pride and their prejudice, and everyone lives happily ever after.
  Negative
In the zombified version, though, the Bennet girls have all been trained as warriors, and the social-strata element comes into play in regards to the location where that training takes place Japan for the elite, China for everyone else.
  Negative
George Wickham  Jack Huston isnt just predatory and untrustworthy, he also might not be entirely alive.
  Negative
And the haughty Lady Catherine de Bourgh a fierce, sleek  Lena Headey is the most celebrated zombie-killer of them all with an eye patch to prove it.
  Positive
Sometimes, this mixture works mainly in the quieter, calmer moments, as when the characters sit around a drawing room cleaning their guns or one-upping each other while comparing their expertise in the deadly arts.
  Neutral
And as the sisters dress in their finest gowns and style their hair for a ball, they also carefully slide daggers into their garters for protection.
  Positive
The small, deadpan moments in Steers script have more of an impact than the massive, noisy set pieces.
  Negative
Through it all, though, James is a delight to watch as Lizzie.
  Positive
If you saw her last year in  Kenneth Branaghs Cinderella, you know how hugely appealing she can be.
  Positive
Here, shes playing a very different kind of iconic figure, but in both cases theres something pure about her screen presence that makes her seem accessible and true.
  Negative
And she has decent chemistry with Riley as the arrogant, abrasive Darcy but then again, several of their key exchanges take place within the context of some sort of physical fight, either with each other or against the stumbling, mumbling undead, which detracts from their inherent romantic tension rather than enhancing it.
  Negative
Its a tricky thing to pull off, this delicate balance of tone.
  Neutral
Very few directors could do it successfully, but it seems Steers whose eclectic filmography ranges from  Igby Goes Down to   Again to Charlie St. Cloud wasnt quite ready to expand his repertoire this far.
  Negative
Maybe someone else can crack the code to the ultimate Austen mash-up when the inevitable Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters adaption comes along.
  Negative
