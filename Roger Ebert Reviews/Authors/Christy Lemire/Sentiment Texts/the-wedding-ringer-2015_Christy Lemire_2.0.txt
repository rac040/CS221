A January comedy starring  Kevin Hart would not necessarily be cause for optimism.
  Negative
See:  Ride Along.
  Positive
On second thought: dont.
  Neutral
Which is why its such a surprise that The Wedding Ringer is vaguely more tolerable than you might expect  enjoyable, even, in sporadic bursts.
  Negative
Lets put it this way: If youre at the multiplex in the middle of the afternoon, and The Wedding Ringer is the only movie playing at a time thats convenient, you wont be completely miserable.
  Negative
This is not exactly a ringing endorsement, I realize.
  Negative
But you take lifes tiny pleasures where you can find them.
  Positive
That was not a dig on the diminutive Hart, I swear!
  Negative
A little of his patented, rat-a-tat comic shtick tends to go a long way' here, his pairing with the sweet, shlubby  Josh Gad tempers him somewhat.
  Negative
The two actors have a nice chemistry with each other which helps enliven the films formula: a familiar mix of bromance and raunch.
  Positive
And while you know where this story is headed from the very start, director  Jeremy Garelick and his co-writer,  Jay Lavender, throw in a few welcome detours.
  Negative
Gad stars as Doug Harris, a successful Los Angeles tax attorney whos about to marry a woman he thinks is completely out of his league: the pretty, blonde Gretchen Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting.
  Positive
While Gretchen is obsessing over salad dressing flavors and is generally depicted in stereotypically controlling, materialistic fashion, Doug is trying to hide from her and their flamboyant wedding planner, Edmundo Ignacio Serricchio, that he doesnt have any groomsmen to go along with her seven bridesmaids.
  Negative
He doesnt even have a best man.
  Positive
Because he has no real friends.
  Negative
Its not that Doug is a bad guy.
  Negative
Quite the contrary  hes obviously kindhearted, caring and decent to the core.
  Positive
But hes also a little awkward when it comes to making pals.
  Negative
So on a tip from Edmundo, he pays a visit Harts Jimmy Callahan, a best man for hire.
  Negative
Jimmy can plan your bachelor party and deliver a killer toast.
  Negative
He can round up as many groomsmen as you need.
  Positive
He can do every type of ceremony imaginable.
  Positive
But hes quite clear about the fact that hell be out the door once the cake is cut because hes not your real friend.
  Negative
Stop me if you think youve heard this one before.
  Neutral
This is essentially the same premise as the  comedy  I Love You, Man, in which  Paul Rudd plays a man whos engaged but doesnt have many male friends, so he goes on a series of dates to find a best man and ends up with the charming but overpowering  Jason Segel.
  Negative
But  as you might imagine  there was a delicacy there and an honesty in that movie which are mostly lacking in The Wedding Ringer.
  Negative
The latter film hints at a male relationship thats more meaningful, but more often would rather go for a crass gag involving a Basset hound and some peanut butter.
  Negative
Jimmy gathers a motley collection of freaks and misfits to serve as the longtime friends on Dougs side of the wedding party.
  Negative
Gretchen never notices that the placeholder names he gives her include Drysdale, Carew, Rambis, Plunkett and Dickerson.
  Negative
Because women dont like sports, silly!
  Positive
These characters are actually fleshed out more than youd expect and the back stories they receive as they pretend to be Doug's buddies are crammed with amusingly bizarre details.
  Negative
And their commitment to the ruse, in the name of this strangers happiness, is oddly sweet.
  Positive
Other characters  mainly, the female ones  are barely there, including a woefully underused  Olivia Thirlby as Gretchens sister and  Cloris Leachman as their grandmother, whose sole purpose is to be set on fire over lunch in a madcap and unfunny slapstick set piece.
  Negative
But the central interplay between Jimmy and Doug has a loopy kind of buoyancy to it, particularly during a scene in which the two crash someone elses wedding as practice.
  Negative
Gad, the Tony-nominated star of The Book of Mormon whos probably best known as the voice of Olaf in  Frozen, gets to put his showmanship on display in a truly inspired dance sequence with Hart.
  Very positive
Its the highlight of the entire movie.
  Positive
Naturally, though, as things are going so well between the two, there will be a couple of sources of conflict you can expect: What happens when these men become too close in violation of their business contract?
  Neutral
And what happens when Gretchen finds out that these were all bros for hire?
  Neutral
The conclusion is a sloppy combination of feel-good and tasteless, but at least its consistent.
  Negative
