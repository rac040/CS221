A lack of tonal self-awareness pervades "Labor Day," like the scent of a freshly baked peach pie wafting through the thick summer air.
  Negative
Ah, yes.
  Neutral
About that pie:it's the main thing viewers have talked about since "Labor Day" premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and had a quick run in theaters in late December to qualify for awards consideration.

Over one unusually hot holiday weekend, they fall in passionate, doomed love and they bake a heavily metaphorical pie.
  Positive
It's hard to tell what Reitman who also wrote the script, based on the novel by  Joyce Maynard intended here.
  Negative
He's crafted a handsome but very self-serious melodrama, seemingly without realizing how unintentionally hilarious some of his more romantic, dramatic moments are.
  Negative
Perhaps he meant it as an homage to a bygone era: the so-called women's pictures of  Douglas Sirk from the s.
  Neutral
What he's come up with hews more closely to the shameless sentimentality of a gauzy  Nicholas Sparks adaptation.

  Negative
While they're at the store, a tall, dark stranger named Frank Brolin approaches Henry and asks for a ride.
  Neutral
Actually, he insists on one.
  Neutral
He's bleeding, intimidating and obviously dangerous but also, you know, extremely hot.
  Very positive
So the three of them go back to Adele's home to give Frank a place to hide out until nightfall.
  Negative
Instead, he ends up staying for the next four days.
  Negative
Because you know what?
  Neutral
It turns out Frank isn't such a bad guy after all.
  Neutral
Rather than threatening Adele or Henry, Frank politely suggests that perhaps he should tie her to a chair, just so she can tell authorities truthfully that she was held captive.
  Negative
The artful lighting as he wraps the rope around her wrists is the stuff of late-night Cinemax fare.
  Positive
He proceeds to make her the most delicious-looking chili from various items she had lying around her kitchen you pour a little coffee in who knew?
  Negative
and then lovingly spoons tidy bites of it into her mouth.
  Negative
This goes beyond Stockholm Syndrome, into sheer seduction.
  Negative
Over the next few days, the too-good-to-be-true Frank satisfies every need in Adele's life, functioning as a husband and father figure as well as a handyman.
  Positive
He changes the oil in her rickety station wagon and clears dead leaves out of the gutters.
  Negative
How's that for sexual symbolism?
  Neutral
He mops and waxes the floors.
  Negative
He does laundry and irons the clothes shirtless, natch.
  Negative
He teaches Henry how to play baseball in the afternoons.
  Negative

  Negative
And when it comes time to mix that ooey-gooey, fruity, sugary mess together, he insists that all three of them get in there, plunge their hands inside, let their fingers intertwine, squish it all around.
  Negative
Inevitably, this major set piece is reminiscent of the famous pottery scene in " Ghost," not just in its staging but in its comparative lack of passion.
  Negative
Reitman does create some moments of genuine tension when it looks as if Frank and his makeshift family are on the verge of getting caught' one involving  James Van Der Beek as a subtly snoopy police officer stands out.
  Positive
And Henry's blossoming relationship with the bored, precocious new girl in town Brighid Fleming shows glimmers of the kind of snappy, darkly funny style that is Reitman's trademark.
  Positive
More often, though, the film seems content to smother us with heavy-handed sentiment, complete with voiceover from  Tobey Maguire as an older version of Henry which spells out everything the characters are obviously thinking and feeling.
