Garrett Hedlund slogs through what feels like the most eventful day in the history of cinema in the mawkish family drama "Lullaby."
  Negative
Hedlund leads a strong cast that mostly goes to waste in artist-turned-writer-director  Andrew Levitas film about a wealthy clan coming together to witness the patriarchs wish to die after a -year battle with cancer.
  Negative
Levitas' tale is earnest and clearly very personal, inspired as it was by events within his own family.
  Very positive
The subject of assisted suicide is certainly a polarizing one, and in theory a film like "Lullaby" should both enlighten and inspire debate.
  Positive
Instead, it feels simultaneously superficial and overbearing, albeit with a few moments that do indeed resonate.
  Negative
At the films start, Hedlunds character, the scruffily handsome Jonathan, is sneaking a cigarette in an airplane bathroom.
  Negative
Hes clearly a mess both physically and emotionally, but has retained enough traces of his charismatic former self that he successfully sweet-talks a flight attendant out of reporting his violation.
  Negative
This early scene actually does more to define his character than his actions throughout the rest of the film.
  Negative
Like so many of Levitas characters, Jonathan is a clich: a trust fund kid turned failed rock star turned aimless and cynical twentysomething.
  Negative
As he returns home to New York on a red eye from Los Angeles, he must reflect on his vague estrangement from his father, an esteemed financial wheeler-dealer played in flashbacks by a toupeed  Richard Jenkins.
  Positive
In the present day, Jenkins efforts as the dying Robert Lowenstein represent the majority of the films emotional weight.
  Negative
Being an actor of great nuance and versatility, Jenkins manages to convey a lot while in a tough spot.
  Positive
Hes lying in a hospital bed most of the time hes on screen, but still finds the sly humor in his character along with the remorse and the healing power of reconciliation with just the slightest lift of an eyebrow or modulation of his voice.
  Positive
He definitely elevates the material beyond whats on the page, and he finds subtlety where its mostly lacking.
  Positive
Also gathered at Roberts bedside are his loyal and weepy wife, Rachel  Anne Archer, stuck in a one-note role, and the couples aspiring-lawyer daughter, Karen  Jessica Brown Findlay, who has filed an injunction to prevent her father from taking himself off life support.
  Negative
Later, Robert will require Karen to present formal arguments against his plan in his sterile but spacious hospital room' this is meant to be a climax of sorts but instead feels distractingly stagey.
  Negative
Findlay as the younger overachiever and Hedlund as the older disappointment do enjoy one decent, middle-of-the-night bonding scene, but their characters still remain types.
  Negative
Jonathan also finds time to trade quips with  Jennifer Hudson as the obligatory sassy nurse who works day and night without any breaks because she serves as a crucial source of humor and the voice of reason.
  Positive
While Hudsons character is clearly a device,  Terrence Howard is given even less of a personality as Roberts trusted physician, whos willing to carry out his wishes.
  Negative
But Jonathan spends the majority of his time away from his fathers bedside, as the clock ticks down with two women who function even more as obvious, screenwriterly ideas than full-fledged people.
  Negative
One is an ex-girlfriend of his the one that got away, it seems who happens to appear magically on any Manhattan street where shes needed to stare wistfully into his eyes and remind him and us that he used to be a good guy.
  Negative
Shes played by a woefully underwritten  Amy Adams in a mostly extraneous part.
  Neutral
Even an actress of her caliber can only do so much with so little.
  Negative
The other is even more of a device: a -year-old girl named Meredith whos also dying of cancer in the same hospital.
  Negative
Shes played by  Jessica Barden, and shes even more magical than Adams character.
  Positive
She has wisdom beyond her years.
  Positive
She has perspective.
  Positive
She says just the right thing at just the right time to make Jonathan stop feeling sorry for himself.
  Neutral
As they meet over surreptitious cigarettes in the hospital stairwell, Jonathan asks Meredith: "Are you even old enough to smoke?"
  Negative
The frail, hairless girl replies matter-of-factly: "Am I old enough to die?"
  Negative
in one of many examples of Levitas stilted dialogue.
  Negative
Jonathan finds time to bond with all these people, plus attend a makeshift Passover Seder for his father, plus serve as Merediths date for the private prom that her fellow patients somehow whip up for her.
  Negative
Relationships that should take days if not weeks to form develop within a few hours' granted, the notion of time means something different to these people, but this is just dizzying and implausible.
  Negative
But Levitas does take a while to wallow in the tear-jerking catharsis.
  Negative
It is lengthy, relentless and unabashed.
  Negative
He also finds a few moments for some obvious symbolism as a couple of characters spend time admiring the newborns at the hospitals maternity ward.
  Negative
Its the circle of life.
  Positive
Someone should write a song about it.
  Neutral
And wouldnt you know?
  Neutral
Jonathan does just that in one of the many endings "Lullaby" has to offer.
  Neutral
