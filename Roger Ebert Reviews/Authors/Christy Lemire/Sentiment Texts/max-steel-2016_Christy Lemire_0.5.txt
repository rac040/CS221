For a movie about developing the greatest energy source in the universe, Max Steel is surprisingly bland, and it comes limping quietly into theaters without being shown to critics before opening day.
  Negative
Based on the Mattel line of games and toys, Max Steel serves as an origin story clearly aimed at tweens and teens with hopes of launching the next big sci-fiaction franchise.
  Negative
But its borderline incomprehensible regardless of your age.
  Negative
Director  Stewart Hendler, working from a script by  Christopher Yost, serves up a series of noisy, murky set pieces that grow repetitive visually and tonally.
  Negative
At the same time, though, the actual nuts and bolts of the story become increasingly confusing, leading to a spectacular conclusion thats unintentionally hilarious.
  Negative
The Orlando Bloom-esque  Ben Winchell stars as Max McGrath, a shy -year-old whos sick of moving from town to town with his widowed mother, Molly  Maria Bello, whose mere presence is the only reason this movie gets half a star.
  Negative
At the films start, the two have just come back to the hometown of his late father  Mike Doyle, seen in flashbacks, a scientist who died long ago in a mysterious, explosive accident.
  Negative
Dads former partner, Miles  Andy Garcia, hamming it up big-time, whos now in charge of the company the two built together, arrives soon afterward to help them get settled.
  Negative
In no time, Max starts discovering that weird things are happening in his body like, he can shoot blue-tinted streaks of liquid energy from his fingertips.
  Negative
Appliances start malfunctioning when hes around, and sometimes he just straight-up blows things up by accident, like a boom box or a lamp.
  Negative
Thankfully, another visitor shows up to explain things: a drone-like, blue-eyed alien named Steel.
  Negative
Hes voiced by  Josh Brener in cheeky, snarky tones that are occasionally amusing but mostly annoying.
  Negative
Although credit where its due the visual effects are pretty seamless in incorporating the flying Steel into Maxs world.
  Positive
Steel trains Max to control his newfound powers in an abandoned factory where he has plenty of room to do flips and tricks off beams and ledges.
  Negative
Its like  Kevin Bacons angry dance in Footloose, only not nearly as entertaining.
  Negative
Once Max is feeling confident, Steel shows him what they can achieve when they physically join forces.
  Negative
When they do, they become a superhero known as  wait for it  MAX STEEL, complete with head-to-toe body armor, super strength, flying abilities and a chest beaming with energy.
  Negative
Hes essentially Iron Teen without the benefit of clever, witty quips.
  Neutral
If only it were that simple, though.
  Negative
Armed bad guys are after Max and Steel, and Max Steel to capture them and harness their energy.
  Negative
Theres also a giant, tornado-like creature with a mean face and glowing red eyes, which might also be an alien  ?
  Negative
As if those nuisances werent bad enough, Max suffers chronic, debilitating headaches from all the energy pulsating through his body, and the force of his chest bursts burns patterns on his T-shirts that are uglier than the worst Ed Hardy designs.
  Very negative
Thankfully, he meets the one nice girl in town whos willing to tolerate Maxs erratic behavior: Sofia Ana Villafae, whos not only smart, beautiful and outgoing, she also knows how to fix bikes.
  Positive
Shes Manic Pixie Dream Girl-adjacent.
  Neutral
Anyway, after a series of similarly shot and paced chase scenes and a whole lot of scientific gobbledygook, theres a big showdown between Max in his fancy suit and another character in a fancy suit we wouldnt dream of telling you who which is meant to be dramatic and tense but ends up being laughably silly.
  Negative
Hendler repeatedly cuts away to their faces inside the suits as they strain and grunt and struggle to control each other, to the extent that its hard to remember what theyre fighting about.
  Negative
A movie based on a toy should be a whole lot more fun than this.
  Positive
