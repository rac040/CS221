Its de rigueur by now, of course, to break the final book in any juggernaut Young Adult series into two films.
  Negative
Harry Potter did it.
  Neutral
Twilight did it.
  Neutral
Why not tantalize and torment the fervent fans of these series even further?
  Negative
Why not make twice as much money?
  Negative
So now we have the absolute, ultimate, this-time-we-mean-it finale of the  The Hunger Games series, the clunkily titled The Hunger Games: Mockingjay  Part .
  Negative
But really, if were talking about things like art and narrative drive which actually can and do exist in this franchise a single film would have worked just fine.
  Negative
Last years Mockingjay  Part  felt like one long placeholder.
  Negative
It featured a lot of wheel spinning and repetitive imagery, and it served as a glaring reminder of what a cynical cash grab this finale-splitting business truly is.
  Negative
With the exception of a couple of truly dazzling action set pieces, Mockingjay  Part  provides more of the same.
  Very positive
The stakes are higher because this is the end It really is this time!
  Positive
but the first hour or so of returning director  Francis Lawrences film is legitimately nap-inducing.
  Negative
From the very first moments, when  Jennifer Lawrences Katniss Everdeen struggles to speak her name as the late, great  Philip Seymour Hoffman looks on sadly as gamesmaker-turned-ally Plutarch Heavensbee, its just unrelentingly dour, even for a film set in a dystopian future.
  Negative
Mercifully, the script from  Peter Craig and  Danny Strong offers a few glimmers of sardonic humor, including quips from  Jena Malone as Katniss fellow victor, the quick-witted Johanna.
  Negative
It would be reasonable for us to hope for something better, however.
  Negative
Based on  Suzanne Collins best-selling trilogy, The Hunger Games series has set the gold standard for all adaptations of post-apocalyptic Young Adult novels.
  Negative
Divergent,  The Maze Runner,  The Giver regardless of when the actual books came out, they always seemed like knock-offs of The Hunger Games films in terms of narrative thrills, weighty themes, production values and star-studded casts.
  Positive
The presence of serious, seasoned actors like Hoffman,  Donald Sutherland,  Julianne Moore,  Woody Harrelson,  Stanley Tucci and  Jeffrey Wright gave these movies a gravitas but also elevated them above your expectations for material aimed at angsty tweens.
  Negative
They were violent, exciting blockbusters but they were also About Something at least the first two movies were.
  Neutral
Many of those stars get just a few lines in the finale a curtain call of sorts, when youd long to see more of them.
  Negative
The abbreviated presence of Hoffman, who died in  of an accidental overdose, is heartbreaking.
  Negative
Tucci appears all-too briefly as unctuous television announcer Caesar Flickerman.
  Negative
Elizabeth Banks shows up in a couple of her typically outrageous outfits as stylist and social climber Effie Trinket, and thats about it.
  Positive
Lawrence herself already seemed to have outgrown the role of plucky teen Katniss Everdeen when Mockingjay  Part  came out a year ago.
  Neutral
By then, shed won an Academy Award for  Silver Linings Playbook and done diverse and dramatic work ranging from  American Hustle to  X-Men: Days of Future Past.
  Positive
Its more than time for her to give a wistful, three-fingered Mockingjay salute goodbye to this character and this franchise once and for all.
  Positive
But Lawrence takes this career-making role seriously, as always and brings her usual, accessible mix of bravery and vulnerability as Katniss prepares for the ultimate showdown with Sutherlands diabolical President Snow in hopes of bringing an elusive peace to war-torn Panem.
  Positive
Leading up to that climactic moment at the Capitol are a lot of dreary strategic conversations in a lot of poorly-lighted, underground hideouts.
  Negative
For a movie about a society thats on the brink of destruction, Mockingjay  Part  features a lot of hurry-up-and-wait.
  Positive
It picks up at the start right where Part  left off, with Katniss reeling from an attack by brainwashed Capitol mouthpiece Peeta  Josh Hutcherson, her fellow former District  tribute-turned-fianc.
  Negative
Merely serving as a symbol of hope in manufactured propaganda films is no longer enough, she realizes.
  Negative
She must join forces with her fellow rebels in their quest to bring down the totalitarian regime that has torn apart the land and taken so many young lives.
  Neutral
Among Katniss fellow fighters in Squad  a number that may ring a bell with you from high school English class are her hunky BFF and hunting buddy Gale  Liam Hemsworth, relegated to sulking and shooting' the charismatic Finnick ODair  Sam Claflin' tatted filmmaker Cressida  Natalie Dormer' and the all-business Boggs  Mahershala Ali, the soldier whos the right-hand man of rebel President Coin Moore, whose severe bob says everything you need to know about her trustworthiness.
  Negative
Eventually, they also take in Peeta, who provides some poignancy as hes clearly working through post-traumatic stress disorder.
  Negative
And as for the potential awkwardness of the Katniss-Gale-Peeta love triangle in close quarters, its to the films credit that the boys are the ones discussing it and their respective roles within it rather than Katniss herself.
  Positive
Shes got more important things to do, as she has throughout the series, like liberate a nation.
  Positive
Along the way to the presidents mansion, they must avoid a series of pods think of them as high-tech IEDs scattered throughout the city.
  Negative
These obstacles provide the films few heart-pounding thrills.
  Negative
A wall of black ooze surges toward the rebel fighters, swallowing several of them whole in gnarly, ferocious fashion.
  Negative
But its the lizard mutt attack in the sewers thats the films high point or low point, if you want to get literal about it.
  Negative
Reptilian and ravenous, these fast-moving creatures are just devastating, and they add an element of paranoia and fear that the rest of the film desperately needed.
  Negative
Seriously, I was curled up in a ball, watching this scene through my fingers.
  Negative
And  James Newton Howards appropriately insistent score definitely ups the anxiety factor.
  Positive
I wouldnt dream of spoiling how the whole series concludes.
  Positive
If youre emotionally invested at this point, you should see it through for yourself, even if its a disappointment.
  Negative
But I will say that theres a tacked-on, extra ending thats needless and tonally inconsistent with everything that came before it.
  Negative
Its a sun-dappled coda in a meadow that belongs in a different YA franchise one with sparkling vampires, perhaps when theres a moment right before it that would have ended the movie, and the series, on a perfectly poignant and satisfying note.
  Positive
Katniss may still be The Girl on Fire, but the flame has turned down to a simmer.
  Negative
