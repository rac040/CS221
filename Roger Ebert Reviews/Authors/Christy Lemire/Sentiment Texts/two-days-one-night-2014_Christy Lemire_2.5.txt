Marion Cotillard casts aside her movie-star persona and her glamorous looks to play a working-class heroine in  Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne's Two Days, One Night.
  Negative
While the film is a real departure for the actress, who won an Oscar for vividly depicting the highs and lows in the life of Edith Piaf in  La Vie en Rose, it fits squarely within the Belgian brothers oeuvre, both thematically and tonally.
  Positive
The Dardennes long have championed the common peoplefound honesty and elegance within their daily strugglesfrom La Promesse to  The Son to The Child to The Kid With a Bike.
  Positive
Their latest follows a wife and mother of two as she fights to win her factory job back.
  Negative
But with Two Days, One Night, the main difference is that the writing-directing brothers have taken a major, international celebrity and placed her within their familiar tracking shots, long, urban walking tours and natural lighting.
  Negative
It may sound like a gimmick: Oh, Marion Cotillard, shes so brave for running around town with no makeup and a messy ponytail.
  Negative
But Cotillard can be an exquisitely subtle actress, with expressive eyes and a face that are made for quiet suffering.
  Positive
Even when Two Days, One Night drags a bit, Cotillards performance remains compelling.
  Positive
In retrospect, her character here isnt all that different from the role she played in the other film thats earning her great acclaim this year,  James Grays  The Immigrant.
  Positive
Both women find themselves in a predicament in which they must fight to maintain even the most meager standard of living' both make decisions to protect their family members which expose them to shame and humiliation.
  Negative
But whereas Grays film is lush with the old-world costume and production design of a century ago, the Dardennes remain within their comfort zone of stripped-down, modern realism.
  Positive
They throw us right into the middle of things, though, and challenge us to keep up.
  Positive
For a while, its unclear what has happened to Cotillards Sandrawhy she is napping on the couch in the middle of the day when the phone rings and wakes her' why the call she receives startles her into action.
  Negative
We must piece it together over the time period that gives the film its title.
  Neutral
We eventually learn that Sandra has been on leave from her manufacturing job for reasons which remain unspecified but clearly have to do with her mental health.
  Negative
A great deal of pill popping goes on over the films brief running time.
  Positive
She shares a modest townhouse with her loving husband, Manu  Fabrizio Rongione, a restaurant kitchen worker, and their two sweet-natured children.
  Negative
But they also need her income to make ends meet.
  Neutral
So when a co-worker calls with the news that she might have a chance to come back, shes immediately encouraged' despite her lethargic state, its obvious that her job has been a source of identity and pride.
  Negative
But heres the problem: Sandras co-workers all have agreed to receive a bonus in exchange for her dismissal.
  Negative
The only way she can return is by persuading a majority of them to sacrifice the , Euros theyre expecting in order for the company to afford to retain her job.
  Negative
The situation seems inordinately sadistic and more than a bit contrived' however, thats what sets the films plot in motion.
  Negative
Over the course of a weekend, Sandra must hop on buses and hoof it across town to knock on the doors of the  people who will decide her fate.
  Negative
In her understated uniform of racer back tank tops with colorful bra straps sticking out and tight jeans, she has the same conversation over and over againor, at least, she begins the conversation the same way.
  Negative
The mystery of how each person will respond provides what little tension exists here and brings life to the films somewhat repetitive rhythms.
  Positive
Unsurprisingly, theyre all in similar financial straits.
  Negative
They all have their reasons for needing the , Euros.
  Negative
Some are sympathetic to her plight and agree to vote in her favor while others are unmovable.

  Negative
But the cumulative effect of these exchanges builds momentum, sneaks up on you and leaves you rooting to see her succeed.
  Positive
Having said that, the films conclusion might upend your notions of the definition of success.
  Negative
The film's power comes in the form of quiet revelations, as is the Dardennes' signature style.
  Positive
