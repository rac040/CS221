In theory, any movie starring  Will Ferrell and  Amy Poehler with a supporting cast that includes  Jason Mantzoukas,  Nick Kroll,  Michaela Watkins and  Rob Huebel should be comedy gold.
  Negative
In theory, these actors should be able to just show up, be themselves, tap into their formidable improvisational abilities and let the laughs flow freely.
  Positive
In reality, though, movies require scripts.
  Negative
They require actual characters and dialogue and narratives that evolve in ways that are logical, or at least engaging.
  Neutral
The House has two credited screenwriters: first-time feature director  Andrew Jay Cohen and his frequent collaborator, Brendan OBrien, who also teamed up to write the Neighbors movies and  Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates.
  Negative
But the result is loose to the point of being sloppy, with allegedly wacky outtakes before the closing credits that provide a glimpse into the production process.
  Negative
Ferrell and Poehler can only do so much with barely-there characters in half-baked situations.
  Negative
Because they hardly feel like people about halfway through, I realized I didnt even know their characters names the extraordinary scheme theyve concocted for themselves makes no sense and has no momentum.It also has no laughs, or at least precious few, which is why a movie with this caliber of star power is being sneaked into theaters without being shown to critics ahead of time.
  Negative
Also in theory, besides being a raunchy, R-rated comedy, The House aims to be a movie that reflects our current economic reality, in which its not necessarily guaranteed anymore that our kids will go to college, build careers and establish better lives for themselves than we have.
  Negative
But thats at odds with the way these characters actually live, one of the many glaring inconsistencies that plague The House.
  Negative
Ferrell and Poehler star as Scott and Kate Johansen, nerdy suburbanites who live in a spacious home in a charming, leafy village called Fox Meadow.
  Negative
Their teenage daughter, Alex  Ryan Simpkins, has just been accepted to her dream school of Bucknell University.
  Negative
But for some reason, Scott and Kate never set aside any money for her college education' despite their well-off status, its unclear what they do for a living, and in an unfunny running bit, Scott is terrible with numbers.
  Negative
So they rely on the annual scholarship the town awards only this year, soulless city councilman Bob Kroll plans to use that money for a lavish community pool.
  Negative
On an ill-advised trip to Las Vegas with their gambling-and-porn addicted pal, Frank Mantzoukas, they hatch a scheme to create an underground casino in Franks house.
  Negative
Hes in the middle of an ugly divorce, and his angry, estranged wife Watkins has cleared out much of the furniture, so theres plenty of room for a craps table and a roulette wheel and such.
  Negative
Frank even sets up a bunch of safes for stashing the cash.
  Neutral
Since theyre the house and the house always wins they should make enough money to pay for Alexs college education in no time.
  Negative
In and of itself, this is not a hilarious premise.
  Negative
Ostensibly, the sight of soccer moms and doughy dads showing up, letting loose and losing their money is intended to provide some knowing laughs: Its true!
  Negative
We get old and we get lame.
  Negative
But The House escalates into such debauchery and depravity so quickly, its jarring, and it depletes the film of essential comic build-up.
  Negative
All of a sudden, the casino features a fight club between housewives in yoga pants and a spa that provides massages with happy endings.
  Positive
The clientele includes Wall Street blowhards doing blow on any surface they can find.
  Negative
And the real criminals in town, led by  Jeremy Renner in an all-too-brief cameo as a mob boss, show up to shut them down.
  Positive
Cohen cuts so briskly from each scenario to the next that they never register.
  Negative
And the most significant shift of all the one that occurs within Scott and Kate is the most extreme and the least plausible.
  Negative
Out of nowhere, shes smoking pot non-stop and hes reinvented himself as an enforcer known as  The Butcher.
  Negative
They start wearing flashy, gangster-style clothing.
  Neutral
And in case we couldnt detect for ourselves that theyve entered shady territory, the theme from The Sopranos plays in the background at one point.
  Negative
This idea of a husband and wife tapping back into their former wild side worked much more successfully in the Neighbors movies especially the first one because they firmly established who  Seth Rogen and  Rose Byrnes characters were, as individuals and as a couple, before they allowed their primal urges to take hold.
  Negative
Here, Ferrell and Poehler fellow former  Saturday Night Live cast members who also co-starred in Blades of Glory barely seem to know each other, much less enjoy any sort of chemistry.
  Negative
The House is the rare raunchy comedy that actually could have stood to be a little longer and not just by padding the running time with outtakes.
  Positive
