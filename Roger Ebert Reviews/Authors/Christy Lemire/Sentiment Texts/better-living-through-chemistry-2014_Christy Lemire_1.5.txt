Playing namby-pamby is not Sam Rockwell's strong suit.
  Negative
Rockwell is a hugely charismatic and versatile actorthe kind of performer whose name you're always happy to see in the opening titles of a filmbut what makes him so interesting is the sense of danger and unpredictability he brings to a role.
  Very positive
He's a wild card.
  Positive
He's a troublemaker.
  Positive
He's the most charming rogue.
  Positive
As a put-upon, small-town pharmacist in "Better Living Through Chemistry," though, he's stuck playing a nice guy who's a bit of a dud.
  Negative
The point of this dark comedy is the transformation his character, Doug Varney, undergoes with the help of pharmaceuticals and a femme fatale.
  Negative
Once he finds his mojo, though, it's a fleeting and not entirely convincing sight to behold.
  Negative
Like Doug's newfound brazenness, "Better Living Through Chemistry" as a whole feels rather superficial and safe.
  Negative
First-time writer-directors  Geoff Moore and  David Posamentier have amassed an impressive cast'  Olivia Wilde in particular enjoys some lively chemistry with Rockwell as the dangerous, married woman who serves as Doug's guide to the dark side.
  Positive
It's just a pity they don't give their players more to do.
  Negative
Jane Fonda, for example, is spectacularly misused as the film's narrator.
  Positive
We only see her once, briefly, even though she's supposed to be a frequent customer.
  Negative
Fonda is forced to spell everything out in heavy-handed and pervasive voiceover: "He was good at what he did," she says of Doug.
  Negative
"I saw it every time I came in."
  Positive
And she delivers the story's cloying, cringe-inducing moral at the end.
  Positive
Doug has allowed everyone to bully him for years.
  Negative
His wife, Kara  Michelle Monaghan, is a demanding and demeaning workout fiend.
  Negative
Cycling, boxing, yoga, vitamins that's her drug of choice.
  Negative
The couple's sullen -year-old son, Ethan Harrison Holzer, is a wannabe ninja who rejects Doug's attempts at closeness.
  Negative
But his chief oppressor is his father-in-law  Ken Howard, who also happens to be his boss.
  Neutral
Even when he retires and hands the pharmacy to Doug, he keeps his own last name on the front window.
  Positive
Everything changes one night during routine prescription deliveries.
  Neutral
When Doug knocks on the door of a secluded McMansion, Wilde's Elizabeth Roberts answers.
  Neutral
She's boozy and blowsy, a trapped trophy wife who self-medicates alone all day through alcohol, cigarettes and pills.
  Negative
All sexy locks and silk lingerie, this woman is clearly trouble, and Wilde plays her with a mix of sophistication and vulnerability that makes her hard to resist.
  Positive
The platinum-blonde hair and striking facial features, coupled with her all-white wardrobe, call to mind " Basic Instinct"-era  Sharon Stone.
  Positive
In no time, Elizabeth and Doug are drinking wine by day and cavorting in the back seat of her Mercedes Benz convertible by night.
  Negative
When Elizabeth suggests that they start dipping into the store's stash, not only does Doug not hesitate, he starts mixing some drug cocktails of his own.
  Negative
The montage depicting his liberation at the hands of this subversive angel should be self-explanatory, but once again, the Fonda voiceover intrusively informs us about what we're watching.
  Negative
Then Elizabeth suggests in passing that the couple should just kill her financier husband  Ray Liotta, strong in just a couple of scenes, make off with his money and start a whole new life together.
  Neutral
It's the ultimate film-noir premise.
  Negative
But as "Better Living Through Chemistry" makes this tonal shift and the tension should be heightening, the movie actually starts running out of steam.
  Negative
A subplot in which a sweetly bumbling DEA agent  Norbert Leo Butz starts snooping around and noticing discrepancies in Doug's inventory also lacks the necessary suspense.
  Negative
"Better Living Through Chemistry" is never mean enough or joyous enough.
  Negative
The naughtiness that's supposed to be providing us vicarious thrills is at odds with the preachy, moralistic narration from Fonda's character.
  Negative
The result is the cinematic equivalent of maintaining a slight buzz.
  Negative
