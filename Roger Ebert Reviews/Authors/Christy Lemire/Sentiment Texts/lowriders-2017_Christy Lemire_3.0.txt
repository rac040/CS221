Ricardo de Montreuils "Lowriders" tells an age-old story of intergenerational conflict, set within a very contemporary slice of Los Angeles.
  Positive
Fathers and sons cant see eye to eye, even though they have more in common than theyd like to admit.
  Positive
Longstanding resentments simmer and eventually boil over.
  Negative
As the song goes, parents just dont understand.
  Negative
Youve seen these stories and themes trotted out a million times before, but the surprisingly fresh Lowriders features such strong performances from a well-chosen cast, you may not mind.
  Positive
The script from  Cheo Hodari Coker and  Elgin James breathes life into these tried-and-true conceits with well-developed, complex characters.
  Positive
And de Montreuil, working with cinematographer  Andres Sanchez, provides a vivid sense of place and a window into a part of the city we dont often seen on film.
  Positive
Set within the mythical Mexican-American car culture of East L.A., Lowriders is richly, culturally specific, yet its themes of regret and reconciliation, ambition and competition, love and loss are so universal, its easy to imagine the film having well-deserved crossover appeal.
  Very positive
And like the ethnically diverse juggernaut that is the Fast amp' Furious franchise, Lowriders is all about family.
  Negative
Demian Bichir is the Alvarez patriarch, Miguel, who runs a Boyle Heights auto body shop by day.
  Negative
But in his free time, he fixes up old cars, cruises the streets and competes with his lowrider crew of fellow old-timers, the Coasters.
  Negative
Its more than a way of life its practically spiritual, and its how Miguel met his wife, Gloria a solid, convincingly de-glammed  Eva Longoria, after the devastating death of his longtime spouse.
  Positive
Miguels younger son, Danny a handsome and likable  Gabriel Chavarria, has his own form of expression as a graffiti artist, a pursuit dad doesnt think is worthwhile.
  Positive
Miguel also worries, understandably, about the dangerous and often illegal lengths to which Danny will go to share his art with the world.
  Negative
This is especially true because his older son, Francisco a charismatic  Theo Rossi, aka  Ghost, just got out of prison after several years for stealing car parts to build his own lowrider, which he drives with his own crew.
  Negative
Clearly, theyll all have to meet up at the big showdown at Elysian Park, the hilly section above downtown thats home to Dodger Stadium, for the annual lowrider competition.
  Negative
But in the meantime, we get a glimpse into the rhythms of these characters lives.
  Negative
Dannys stepsister, Isabel  Montse Hernandez, worries about what dress shell wear for her quinceaera.
  Negative
His best friend, Chuy  Tony Revolori of  The Grand Budapest Hotel, tags along and tries to fit in with Ghost and his tough, older friends.
  Negative
Meanwhile, Danny starts dating a white street photographer  Supergirl  Melissa Benoist, joining her for downtowns monthly art walk and trying awkwardly to blend in with her pretentious friends.
  Negative
In one the films best scenes, she puts Danny in a socioeconomic box he doesnt want to be in while gushing over his work to a gallery owner' it stings, and when he chafes, we feel it.
  Positive
But the emotional heart of the film belongs to Bichir as a recovering alcoholic whos made plenty of mistakes and finally finds the guts to admit them.
  Negative
His performance aches with melancholy, but he also finds in this man an unmistakably sturdy sense of pride.
  Positive
Bichirs exchanges with the charming yet volatile Rossi give the film a steady sense of tension.
  Positive
Lowriders may spell too much out with obvious dialogue, and it may veer a bit too easily toward melodrama.
  Negative
But theres an earnestness and a fundamental truth to this familial saga as well as an appealing, low-budget scrappiness that consistently make it hum.
  Positive
