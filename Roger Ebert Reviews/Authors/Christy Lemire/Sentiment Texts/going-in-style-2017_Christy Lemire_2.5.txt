The comedy is bigger, the supporting players are wackier and the antics move to the bouncy beat of an incessantly perky soundtrack.
  Positive
And the script is more of a crowd-pleaser which makes sense, given that it comes from  Hidden Figures co-writerdirector  Theodore Melfi both in its characters likability and in their purpose.
  Negative
Because you see, Joe  Michael Caine, Willie  Morgan Freeman and Al  Alan Arkin dont rob just any bank and they dont do it just for fun.
