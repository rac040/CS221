Minute Mile at least has the decency to acknowledge that its aware of its underdog sports-movie clichs, especially the ones that made The Karate Kid such an s classic.
  Positive
Kelly Blatz, as a troubled but talented high school runner named Drew, doesnt understand why the aging, alcoholic coach Coleman Richard Jenkins makes him perform all kinds of manual labor when he should be training him for the regional track meet.

Among the grueling work that Drew is forced to endure: Sanding the coachs dilapidated boat while coach himself sits back and enjoys yet another cigarette.

Wax on, wax off, Coleman says with a wry smile.
  Negative
Director  Charles-Olivier Michaud and writers  Josh Campbell and  Jeff Van Wie use this rare moment of humor to say what were all thinking as viewers.
  Positive
Yet the filmmakers remain unrelenting in running through a checklist of genre conventions.
  Negative
Theres the good-hearted kid from the wrong side of the tracks, the mentor seeking his own redemption, the trash-talking competitor, the mom struggling to keep her family together and the sweetly supportive girlfriend.
  Negative
And the montages oh, so many montages.
  Negative
Even 'Rocky had a montage, to quote a song from the great Team America: World Police.
  Negative
Still,  Minute Mile is efficient in its storytelling which is fitting, given that its about a sprinter and Jenkins and Blatz have solid chemistry with each other.
  Positive
To the surprise of absolutely no one, Jenkins enlivens this well-worn material through his sheer presence, his intelligent choices and the emotional truth he brings to even the most obvious scenes.
  Positive
Hes got his work cut out for him, though, given the hammy lines hes saddled with as his character steadily spouts inspirational nuggets.
  Negative
Running is not just physical.
  Negative
Its in your head, Coleman says when he first agrees to train Drew.
  Negative
And in a repeated theme involving running through your inner demons: If you do face that fear, itll change your life.
  Negative
Drew already has faced a lot of hardship at a young age.
  Neutral
His father died when he was a child'  years later, he and his brother a muscled-and-tatted  Cam Gigandet and mother a blowsy, barely-there Kim Basinger are struggling to pay the mortgage on their working-class Seattle home.
  Negative
Older brother Wes, whos on parole, ropes Drew into dropping off cash payments to a seedy local drug dealer.
  Negative
Clearly, this arrangement wont end well.
  Negative
But theres hope for Drew.
  Positive
Hes fast.
  Neutral
He gets kicked off the high school track team for being mouthy but maintains a flirty friendship with fellow runner Lisa  Analeigh Tipton, who has an off-kilter likability but is stuck serving as a cheerleader.
  Negative
Coleman sees something special in Drew and offers to teach him everything he knows granted that he changes his event from the  to the mile, and that he strives to run that distance in a punishing four minutes.
  Positive
And as it just so happens, just as Drew is in need of a father figure, Coleman is in need of a son.
  Negative
His own boy who was a talented runner himself was killed in a car accident.
  Negative
Its all extremely formulaic and convenient.
  Negative
Like Mr. Miyagi, Coleman is sad, lonely and alone and he drinks heavily to numb the pain.
  Negative
Theres a mystical quality to his self-imposed isolation.
  Positive
Do you think its possible that by working with this surly kid, it will improve both of their lives?
  Neutral
First, though, Drew has to agree to Colemans unorthodox training methods, which include running -second sprints through ankle-deep water, dragging a giant tire from one side of a swimming pool to the other and doing quarter-mile laps around the docks instead of at the slick and shiny track.
  Neutral
In one artfully lighted montage after another, Drew runs around his neighborhood, at sunset, through the city streets, across parking lots and in slow motion.
  Negative
Despite its overly familiar trajectory, though,  Minute Mile is nicely understated, and surprisingly not as mawkish as the material might suggest.
  Negative
Michaud depicts the blue-collar Washington settings vividly.
  Positive
And while Blatz is a bit of a handsome, blank slate aside from his characters sullenness, hes believable in his physicality which is crucial given that hes running, or talking about running, or planning to run nearly the entire time.
  Negative
If only his destination were more of a mystery.
  Neutral
