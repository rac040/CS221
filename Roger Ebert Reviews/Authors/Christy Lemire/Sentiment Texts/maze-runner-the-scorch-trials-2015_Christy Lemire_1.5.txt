Bigger isnt necessarily better when it comes to sequels.
  Negative
Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials is larger than its predecessor, last years  The Maze Runner, in every way: in its cast, scope, set pieces and unfortunately length.
  Negative
But more also means more convoluted.
  Negative
The mythology in these dystopian young adult novels-turned-films can be dense at times, but Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials crams in more lore, supporting characters, backstories and motivations to the extent that it becomes difficult to get a grasp on anything.
  Very negative
Returning director  Wes Ball covers a lot more ground this time, literally and figuratively, in adapting the second novel in author  James Dashners Maze Runner series.
  Negative
But while his characters are constantly on the run, it feels like theyre never really going anywhere.
  Negative
The script from T.S. Nowlin who co-wrote the first film in the franchise has an episodic structure that ultimately makes it feel repetitive.
  Negative
The characters are in one post-apocalyptic bunker, then theyre in another.
  Negative
Theyre under the protection of one untrustworthy adult, then another.
  Negative
Theyre skulking about an abandoned mall by flashlight, then slinking through a sewer system by flashlight.
  Negative
They walk across the desert by day, trying to survive the heat, then run across it by night, trying to escape lightning strikes.
  Negative
These adventures might be more intriguing if the characters involved in them had even a smidgen of depth.
  Negative
The hero who emerged at the center of part one, Thomas Dylan OBrien, remains the quietly courageous leader in part two.
  Positive
Hes the requisite rebel in this YA series, cut from the same cloth as Katniss in  The Hunger Games and Tris in  Divergent' hes the one who dares to shake up the status quo, challenge a cold, monolithic government known by the not-so-subtle acronym WCKD i.e. the grown-ups and start a revolution.
  Negative
He doesnt develop much of a personality along the way, though, even though we receive clues from his past that he has always been The Chosen One.
  Positive
His buddies from the Glade dont fare much better in the characterization department.
  Positive
Newt Thomas Brodie-Sangster remains wisecracking and irreverent.
  Negative
Frypan  Dexter Darden is girl-crazy.
  Negative
Teresa  Kaya Scodelario, their only female companion, is mysterious and morose.
  Negative
Along with a few others, they all find themselves stuck inside a different kind of compound at the start of the film, which picks up right where The Maze Runner left off.
  Negative
They get food and shelter and clean clothes and actual beds at this new place, which sounds like a good deal.
  Positive
But then they and kids who managed to escape other mazes gather each night at dinner to find out which of them will be whisked away to a supposedly exciting new home.
  Negative
Clearly, nothing good is in store for any of these people.
  Negative
Thats obvious simply from the demeanor of the guy who runs the joint, the turtleneck-clad, vaguely accented Janson  Aidan Gillen.
  Negative
When Thomas and hoodie-wearing loner Aris  Jacob Lofland do a little middle-of the-night exploring, they stumble upon the nefarious medical experiments scientists are performing on these kids, all in the name of finding a cure for the plague that has ravaged the nation.
  Negative
At least thats how  Patricia Clarkson, as the crisp and efficient doctor Ava Paige, justifies such creepily devious actions.
  Positive
As in part one, the great Clarkson is sadly underused here' so are fellow supporting players  Barry Pepper and  Lili Taylor in barely-there supporting roles.
  Negative
Its this discovery that sets Thomas and his friends on their journey to find help and safety, which does feature some tense moments within individual action sequences and some striking imagery.
  Positive
One shot in particular stands out of the kids walking single-file along the top of a sand dune, silhouetted by the sun, then stopping simultaneously and spaced apart perfectly once they hear a gunshot shatter the desert silence.
  Negative
But other elements feel too obviously derivative of better films.
  Negative
As the teens traipse across the decimated remnants of a once-thriving urban center known as the Scorch, each hill of rubble they crest calls to mind the bombed-out remains of the various districts in The Hunger Games series.
  Negative
And a sequence in which they run for their lives from ravenous zombies in an abandoned shopping mall is straight out of Dawn of the Dead.
  Negative
These hideous creatures, known as Cranks, have been infected by the plague' its turned them into fast-moving, Danny Boyle-style zombies rather than slow-shuffling George Romero-style zombies, for those of you who like to keep track of these things.
  Very negative
A far more inspired scene finds Thomas amp' Co. sneaking into the hidden headquarters of underground leadermercenary Jorge  Giancarlo Esposito and his feisty daughter figure, Brenda  Rosa Salazar.
  Negative
This is by far the most gripping segment of the film, not only because Jorges lair is so cool and intricate and Esposito brings such lan to this complicated bad-guy figure, but also because it sets up the only flat-out fun moment youll see.
  Positive
I wont spoil it for you, but I will say that it features inspired use of the Patsy Cline classic Walkin After Midnight .
  Negative
The rest of the movie, choked in sand and dust and surrounded by concrete and steel, could have used more bursts of that kind of crazy energy.
  Positive
The self-seriousness of it all becomes suffocating and theres only more of it to come.
  Negative
After all, theres still a third and final book out there, waiting to be made into a movie if not two.
  Negative
