If youre a child of the s like I am,  John Hughes movies were a major force in defining your youth.
  Negative
You may not be able to recall what you had for breakfast yesterday morning, but you can still recite every word of  The Breakfast Club three decades later.
  Negative
The brain works in mysterious ways.
  Positive
The Edge of Seventeen is a strong successor to Hughes legacy with its mix of biting humor and bittersweet heart.
  Very positive
With her feature filmmaking debut, writerdirector  Kelly Fremon Craig hits many of the relatable notes and angst-filled moments that are staples of the teen dramedy genre: the narcissistic sensation that everything happening in your life is super-important, the awkwardness of struggling to forge an identity within the high-stakes pressure cooker of high school.
  Negative
But its also darker and truer than Hughes films usually dared to be, and it updates his characterizations in ways that are essential for todays audiences.
  Negative
Primarily, though, The Edge of Seventeen is a delight, with  Hailee Steinfeld serving as the radiant star at its center.
  Positive
An Oscar nominee for the Coen brothers  version of True Grit and a pop star on the rise, Steinfeld further reveals her versatility as a whip-smart yet socially moronic teenager named Nadine.
  Positive
Her one and only friend since childhood is the perky and slightly better-adjusted Krista  Haley Lu Richardson.
  Negative
Her older brother, Darian  Blake Jenner, so likable as the wide-eyed, freshman baseball player in Everybody Wants Some!!
  Positive
, is the golden boy who can do no wrong.
  Neutral
Her widowed mother, Mona  Kyra Sedgwick, works hard to support the family as a frazzled, single mom.
  Negative
Every day is miserable for Nadine, as you can imagine it must be when hormones and immaturity wont allow you to enjoy being the smartest person in the room.
  Negative
She finds a worthy sparring partner for her lacerating wit in her history teacher, Mr. Bruner a wonderfully understated  Woody Harrelson, who dishes it out as well as he takes it and seems undaunted by her insubordination.
  Very positive
On the contrary, he actually seems to enjoy their little lunchtime spats.
  Negative
The snappy rapport between Steinfeld and Harrelson make these scenes some of the films best.
  Positive
Her other unlikely ally is the sweet, smart Erwin  Hayden Szeto, the slightly nerdy but deeply decent classmate who harbors a not-so-secret crush on her.
  Positive
Szeto is a tremendous find: cute and charismatic, he benefits greatly from Craigs willingness to defy expectations about high school types.
  Very positive
And in creating an Asian character who emerges as both a hero and a heartthrob by the films end, Craig rights some of the late Hughes wrongs, particularly when it came to broad, ethnic caricatures.
  Negative
Just try watching Long Duk Dongs wacky shtick in  Sixteen Candles now without cringing.
  Negative
Nadines whole world, precarious as it already was, comes crashing down when her best friend hooks up with her brother after a long night of drinking and then starts dating him seriously.
  Positive
She tries going along with it at first, joining Darian and Krista at the kind of raging party that only takes place in teen movies.
  Negative
But she also acts out, trying in vain to recoup some sense of self.
  Negative
This leads to another staple of the genre: the accidental sending of a massively embarrassing missive.
  Negative
Since its , Nadines love note takes the form of a Facebook message to a good-looking bad boy named Nick  Alexander Calvert.
  Positive
God, juvie made him so hot, she comments longingly toward the films start.
  Negative
One of Craigs many clever touches: The first time Nadine works up the nerve to talk to Nick, Spandau Ballets True queues up in the background in what has to be an homage to Sixteen Candles.
  Positive
Even the trying-on-clothes montage in preparation for her big night with Nick takes place through a different prism than you might expect.
  Neutral
And the melancholy tone Craig ultimately sets for this section of Nadines misadventures is another great example of the risks shes prepared to take.
  Positive
Much of The Edge of Seventeen is zippy and zingy, but Craig seems just as comfortable taking the story into sadder, more honest directions.
  Positive
She doesnt necessarily wrap everything up in a way thats tidy and pleasing.
  Positive
Similarly, much of what makes Nadine so compelling is that fact that she isnt always nice.
  Positive
Shes capable of laughing at herself for her frequent follies, but her default mode is misanthropy, and she doesnt suffer fools.
  Negative
She can be mean and impulsive and shes often the victim of her own undoing.
  Neutral
Steinfeld makes this intriguing jumble of contradictions feel real and alive.
  Very positive
She doesnt seem interested in making us like this girl whos perched on the edge of womanhood.
  Neutral
She just tries to make her feel true and thats what makes us love her.
  Positive
