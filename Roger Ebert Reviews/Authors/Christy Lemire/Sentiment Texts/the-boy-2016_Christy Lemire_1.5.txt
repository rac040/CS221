In the pantheon of creepy dolls  from Talky Tina in The Twilight Zone to Chucky in the Childs Play movies to Annabelle in  The Conjuring  its often the idea of the inanimate object coming to life and wreaking bloody havoc thats more frightening than the actual execution.
  Negative
Its a tricky thing to pull off: drawing shivers from turning a childhood plaything into something truly menacing vs. eliciting giggles at the sheer silliness of the proposition.
  Negative
Such is the unfortunate  and unintentionally hilarious  case of The Boy, whose moody atmosphere and committed performances cant conceal the fact that this is one dumb flick.
  Negative
Its also a flick that wasnt shown to critics before opening day' the studio actually pulled its scheduled Thursday -night sneaks of the film, in case you were wondering whether to be optimistic.
  Negative
Lauren Cohan of The Walking Dead does her best, though, to take her role seriously through all its implausible twists and turns.
  Positive
She stars as Greta, a pretty, young American who travels to a remote English village to take a job as a nanny for an -year-old boy.
  Positive
Seems shes got a troubled romantic past and needs to get as far away from home as possible' what she finds, though, is that shes far away from everything else, too.
  Very negative
When she pulls up in a chauffeured car to the Heelshires stately, intimidating manor, she remarks in awe: Its like something out of a storybook, isnt it?
  Negative
Actually, its like something out of every Gothic horror movie youve ever seen, complete with wild, misty grounds, dark stairways, hidden passages and things that go bump in the night.
  Negative
When Greta meets the rigid, conservatively dressed Heelshires veterans  Jim Norton and  Diana Hardcastle, who look more like the grandparents of an -year-old boy than the parents, she receives a strict list of rules and a routine to which she must adhere.
  Negative
She also meets the boy himself  who isnt a boy at all but rather a china doll with a prim wardrobe of tiny suits and cardigans and a glassy stare.
  Positive
But the Heelshires, whove named him Brahms, treat him like a living, breathing child.
  Positive
They talk to him.
  Neutral
They feed him.
  Neutral
They carry him up and down stairs, play classical records for him and tuck him into bed at night.
  Negative
Oh, Brahms!
  Positive
You must sit up straight, his mother gently scolds at one point.
  Negative
Later she coos, Mommys so proud of you.
  Positive
Ostensibly, the matter-of-fact way in which these genteel, wealthy people regard what is clearly a toy is meant to be unnerving.
  Negative
Are they deranged or diabolical?
  Neutral
And Greta, as our stand-in, expresses all the skepticism and apprehension that we would in this bizarre situation.
  Negative
But she needs the money, so she takes the job.
  Negative
Although how she found out about the gig from her small town in Montana is a mystery' the Heelshires have no Internet or cell service and seem to have stopped communicating with the outside world decades ago.
  Negative
The couples other employee is Malcolm  Rupert Evans, the funny, flirty grocery clerk who runs errands for them in town and comes by once a week.
  Negative
His presence, like Gretas, is a bit of a mystery.
  Positive
Who is he?
  Neutral
Why do they trust him?
  Negative
Does he have any life outside his weekly visits?
  Neutral
Questions abound in the script from  Stacey Menear, and were just scratching the surface to avoid spoilers.
  Negative
But Malcolm is decent enough to fill Greta in on whats happening here: The real Brahms died in a fire  years ago on his thbirthday, and the Heelshires have been using the doll as a stand-in ever since.
  Negative
It all seems harmless enough despite its oddness  until the Heelshires go out of town for a long-overdue holiday and leave Greta alone with Brahms.
  Negative
Suddenly, she finds her belongings disappearing and reappearing and hears a childs laughter and sobs echoing through the hallways.
  Positive
The doll itself doesnt move  at first  but strange things are clearly afoot.
  Negative
Director  William Brent Bell stages a couple of genuinely tense moments  one of which takes place on a tried-and-true, dark-and-stormy night  but for the most part cant decide whether to play it straight or have a little fun with this outlandish premise along the lines of Guillermo  Del Toros ravishing  Crimson Peak.
  Positive
He relies too heavily on jump scares, nightmare sequences and the general foreboding of the house itself to do the work.
  Negative
And so were in a bit of a mushy gray area in the middle where the characters decisions, reactions and dialogue make us laugh, but perhaps not knowingly.
  Negative
Its awkward and strange but never shamelessly over-the-top enough to serve as a guilty pleasure.
  Negative
The twist that explains whats really going on here feels like a bit of a letdown, as does the climactic confrontation involving the truly evil force thats been toying with and tormenting Greta.
  Very negative
Its more rote than revelatory, and the possibility of a sequel in the final shot plays more like a threat than a promise.
  Negative
