American Ultra tries to combine a sweet, slacker romance with a slick, super-violent action flick.
  Neutral
If that sounds jarring to you, thats probably because it is.
  Negative
Mixing such disparate genres requires a more deft hand than the one on display from director  Nima Nourizadeh, whose previous feature is the found-footage, high-school pukefest  Project X. American Ultra has far more sophisticated production values than that first film then again, so does your average wedding video but its just as bludgeoning.
  Negative
Yet the script from  Max Landis  Chronicle starts out with all the grungy, morose trappings of your typical small-town, indie drama.
  Negative
Jesse Eisenberg stars as Mike Howell, a long-haired stoner who works at a vividly run-down convenience store in desolate and remote West Virginia.
  Neutral
His only goal in life is to propose to his girlfriend, Phoebe  Kristen Stewart, a bail bondsman with whom he shares a bong, a home and, hopefully, a lifetime.
  Negative
Mike knows he doesnt deserve her and for a while, its a wonder why she stays with him, given that theres not much to him, and one of the few charming running gags involves his inability to find just the right time to pop the question.
  Negative
Then one night at work, a strange woman walks up to him at the checkout counter, utters some strange words while buying a cup of soup and walks out.
  Negative
Suddenly, he finds he has the ability to swiftly kill two bad guys who come at him in the parking lot, with the spoon from the aforementioned soup, which the strange woman left behind.
  Negative
As it turns out, Mike is a highly-trained operative from an abandoned government program, and that woman  Connie Britton was a CIA agent who came to activate him in hopes of keeping him alive.
  Very negative
And now it makes sense that American Ultra takes place in a town called Liman, W.V. perhaps its an homage to  Doug Limans  The Bourne Identity, with some druggy nuggets of one of the directors earliest films, Go.
  Negative
Like the amnesiac Jason Bourne, Mike is a killing machine and he never knew it, piecing together in his mind the lethal skills and high-tech information he never realized he had.
  Negative
This might put a damper on his engagement plans.
  Neutral
Or will it?
  Neutral
American Ultra strains to maintain the early, yearning vibe of its young, desperate lovers, even as the threatening scenarios and gory action sequences grow more intense and elaborate.
  Negative
Eisenberg and Stewart, who co-starred in the  dramedy  Adventureland, have an easy, lived-in chemistry with each other, even as the stakes increase although Eisenberg is hard to accept as a character whos lacking in wit and ambition.
  Negative
Hes at his best when hes playing the smartest person in the room, as he has in films like  The Squid and the Whale and  The Social Network.
  Negative
Also going to waste is a cavalcade of supporting players stuck frustratingly in one-note roles.
  Very negative
Britton brings class and smarts to her part as a veteran agent who dares to go rogue for the greater good, but  Topher Grace is singularly snarling and sniveling as her much younger superior, whos only looking out for himself.
  Neutral
John Leguizamo grates as a tatted and trash-talking drug dealer.
  Negative
Tony Hale gets little more to do than be meek and subordinate as Brittons longtime colleague.
  Negative
Walton Goggins, as an arsonist-turned-operative named Laugher, has one genuine moment of connection with Eisenberg but is mostly maniacal.
  Negative
And  Bill Pullman shows up for maybe two minutes tops as everyones shadowy big boss.
  Negative
But the thing is, all of their efforts to kill Mike or keep him alive culminating in a wildly bloody and explosive conclusion in a discount superstore, which features a few clever ideas seem rather moot.
  Positive
We know from the beginning that Mike will be fine.
  Positive
The whole film is told in flashback as he sits chained to an interrogation table, bruised and sliced but intact nonetheless, which depletes the whole effort of any real tension.
  Negative
Perhaps the hope is that youll see the movie in an altered state yourself, and that youll have forgotten about all that stuff at the start.
  Negative
