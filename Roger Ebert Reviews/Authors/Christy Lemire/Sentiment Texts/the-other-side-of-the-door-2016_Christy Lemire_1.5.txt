Somewhere deep down deep, deep down The Other Side of the Door might be trying to say something about American exceptionalism.
  Negative
It might have a message about moving to a foreign country only to live in remote idyll, away from the squalor and teeming masses, blithely unconcerned with the power of centuries-old native beliefs and traditions.
  Negative
It might be trying to make a point.
  Negative
If so, it sure is hard to hear it over the noisy screeches and cheap jump scares.
  Negative
Set in Mumbai, The Other Side of the Door is essentially an overly familiar ghost story swathed in pseudo-Hindu mumbo jumbo.
  Negative
It cobbles together many of the ideas and images, sights and sounds youve experienced a million times before in superior horror movies, packages them up and ships them off to India.
  Very negative
Every once in a while, director and co-writer  Johannes Roberts comes up with a genuine jolt or showcases the local scenery with a particularly pretty establishing shot.
  Positive
Otherwise, his film remains mostly mundane, predictable and even sort of exploitative.
  Negative
It all begins blissfully enough, though, as husband and wife Michael  Jeremy Sisto and Maria  Sarah Wayne Callies are walking along the beach in India where Michael frequently travels for his work as an antiques dealer, luxuriating in the news that theyre expecting their first child.
  Negative
They decide spontaneously to move there permanently and make it their home as they start a family.
  Negative
Because they can.
  Neutral
Cut to six years later.
  Neutral
Maria suffers from chronic nightmares.
  Negative
She and Michael seem to be enjoying a lovely life in a colorful, comfortable home with their adorable daughter, Lucy  Sofia Rosinsky, their ever-helpful live-in housekeeper, Piki Suchitra Pillai-Malik, and their friendly golden retriever, Winston.
  Positive
But its clear from photos and home videos that Maria and Michael once had another child, Oliver  Logan Creran.
  Negative
An extended flashback details the horrific way he died: He drowned while trapped in his seat during a car accident, which his mother and sister survived.
  Negative
We see Olivers panic and his mothers fear as the water rises inside the vehicle.
  Negative
We hear his cries and pleas for her not to leave him and witness as he desperately gasps for his final breaths.
  Negative
We see Maria sobbing uncontrollably as she clutches the little girl she managed to save.
  Negative
To use a bad TV news clich, its every parents worst nightmare.
  Very negative
This should be gut-wrenching stuff especially for this critic in particular, whos the mother of a boy about the same age as Oliver with similar blonde, fair features.
  Positive
But Roberts handles it all in such clanging, heavy-handed fashion, it feels more like an assault than anything else then, later, a shameless attempt to wring facile fright from legitimate devastation as Maria struggles to work through her grief.
  Very negative
Coincidentally, Piki also lost a child a daughter in a tragic water death.
  Negative
And she has some advice for Maria in the form of an ancient ritual.
  Positive
She tells her about an abandoned temple in her remote village.
  Positive
There, you can scatter the ashes of the dead on the front steps, go inside, wait for nightfall and listen by the door.
  Negative
The person you want to speak with one last time will appear on the other side.
  Positive
You can talk to each other, say your final goodbyes and achieve closure.
  Positive
But you cannot open the door.
  Negative
We repeat: You can NOT open the door.
  Negative
So guess what Maria does?
  Neutral
She goes through all these elaborate steps beginning with digging up her childs buried corpse and cremating it, listens at the door, hears Olivers voice, tells him she loves and misses him and that shes sorry she couldnt save him.
  Negative
Then she opens the door.
  Neutral
In the process, she also opens up the portal between the living and the dead, or some such.
  Negative
Roberts, meanwhile, opens up a big bag of tried-and-true, haunted-house movie tricks.
  Negative
Soon after Maria returns home to her family, strange things start happening.
  Negative
Toys move around mysteriously.
  Neutral
Wooden blocks tumble to the floor, spelling out Olivers name.
  Negative
A light flickers on by itself.
  Negative
A book gets knocked off a shelf.
  Negative
A piano plays Heart and Soul in the middle of the night.
  Positive
And the dog the poor, sweet dog tries to warn everyone about whats going on, his sharp bark piercing the quiet darkness in vain.
  Negative
To her credit, Callies has an accessible presence and tries to provide more pathos and humanity than were supplied on the page, even as her character makes increasingly idiotic decisions in the name of parental love.
  Negative
Sisto gets little more to do than rush in late and catch half the story, over and over again.
  Negative
And Pillai-Malik the only Indian actor with an actual speaking part is in the thankless role of being right and suffering for it all the same.
  Negative
