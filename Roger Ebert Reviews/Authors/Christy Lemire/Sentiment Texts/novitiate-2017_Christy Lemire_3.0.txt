Im in LOVE, Mom!
  Neutral
a teenager cries out to her mother with a heady mix of girlish giddiness and adolescent angst.
  Neutral
But the object of her affection isnt a boy, or even another girl.
  Negative
Its God, and her ardor is powerful enough to drive her to devote her life to Him as a nun.
  Positive
Writerdirector  Margaret Betts explores this mystical passion in Novitiate, her thematically ambitious, technically-precise feature debut.
  Positive
A movie about nuns in the 's may not sound exciting.
  Negative
It may not even sound vaguely intriguing.
  Negative
But Betts wisely depicts these young women as individuals who contain multitudes, even within such a structured setting.
  Negative
Theyre full of contradictions as they figure out who they are and what their place is in the world just like any young woman in any walk of life.
  Negative
These teenage girls, however, have chosen to dedicate themselves to God to marry Him, as they say in the vernacular, which includes donning a white gown and veil and taking vows.
  Negative
Its a decision Betts portrays with open-heartedness and without judgment, an unusual and admirable feat in a film about organized religion.
  Positive
And yet theres something exotic about this sacred realm: a sheltered, silent convent where stone walls, immaculate grounds and rigid rules can only contain secrets for so long.
  Positive
Novitiate explores what happens when the girls natural sexual urges begin to bubble up for men theyve not yet met, for each other, for God Himself and how they clash with the inherent chastity of their calling.
  Neutral
Its a time of flux for the Catholic Church, though.
  Neutral
Novitiate takes place just as the changes of Vatican II are going into effect throughout the world radical, liberal shifts in ideology that are meant to foster openness and inclusiveness, but which fly in the face of hard-liners long-held beliefs and practices.
  Negative
As the Reverend Mother a cruel leader who hasnt set foot outside the convents gates in  years  Melissa Leo is chilling and often deliciously over the top.
  Positive
She intends to run things the way she always has, with an iron hand and a raging temper, and finds it increasingly difficult to do so.
  Negative
Her young postulants who aspire to become novitiates before taking their finals vows aim to please her every step of the way, but they also undergo moments of questioning and doubt.
  Neutral
We endure this demanding experience with them through the eyes of Cathleen  Margaret Qualley in a star-making performance, the aspiring nun who proclaims her love for God at the films start.
  Negative
At first, her choice seems like an act of rebellion against her single mother, a profane, chain-smoking atheist.
  Negative
Julianne Nicholson is excellent as always in the role, a no-nonsense spitfire and voice of reason whose brashness cuts through a deliberately-paced film that can be quiet and restrained to a fault.
  Very positive
As Cathleen gets further into her training, though, she finds the strength of her faith repeatedly tested.
  Positive
Reverend Mother warns the girls from the get-go that shes the voice of God on Earth, and that hard work awaits them.
  Negative
Shes R.  Lee Ermey from  Full Metal Jacket in a floor-length habit, sadistic and manipulative as she separates the wheat from the chaff.
  Negative
Cathleens devotion manifests itself in primal ways, a potentially shocking notion that Betts depicts with understated intimacy.
  Positive
Betts camera does wonders with Qualleys open, expressive face.
  Positive
And she remains tasteful in her approach as the arduousness of the training steadily takes its toll on Cathleen, body and soul.
  Positive
Again, though, hers is but one experience.
  Neutral
Rather than indicting the church itself, Betts seems more interested in exploring what drives these girls on the brink of adulthood to pursue such a rigorous spiritual quest and what prompts some of them to abandon it.
  Negative
As Sister Evelyn,  Morgan Saylor gives a wrenching monologue during a ritual in which shes forced to examine her faults before the Reverend Mother and her fellow novitiates' conversely,  Dianna Agron provides a much-needed source of warmth as the girls trainer, who embraces Vatican IIs changes at her own peril.
  Negative
Novitiate finds room for all these viewpoints' appreciating the dedication it takes to live such a life while also questioning its suppression of individuality and emotion.
  Positive
This willingness to embrace such complexity is a bit of a miracle in itself.
  Positive
