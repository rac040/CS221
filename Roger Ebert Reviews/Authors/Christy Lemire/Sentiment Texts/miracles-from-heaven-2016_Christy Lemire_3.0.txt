Bring tissues.
  Positive
Because whether youre the faithful target audience for Miracles From Heaven, a non-believer or someone in the mass agnostic middle ground, you may find it hard to hold back the tears during various points in this real-life tale.
  Negative
And theyll be earned.
  Negative
This could be the first faith-based film to truly cross over and find both critical acclaim and a mainstream audience beyond just the church-going crowd.
  Positive
And there have been a lot of them lately which have opened with varying degrees of success, from cheesy bombs like  Kirk Camerons Saving Christmas and the  Nicolas Cage version of  Left Behind to films that have been box-office hits if not critical ones like Gods Not Dead and  Heaven Is for Real.
  Negative
Miracles From Heaven shares the same producers as that last film, as well as some of the same redemptive, inspirational ideas and the real-life hook.
  Positive
Its based on the  memoir of the same name by  Christy Beam, whose daughter, Anna, suddenly suffered from a rare intestinal disorder and then, just as suddenly, was cured in the craziest of ways.
  Negative
Much of what makes the film work is its emotionally demanding performance from the ever-accessible  Jennifer Garner.
  Negative
She gets a big arc to work within, revealing warmth and vulnerability, grit and determination as Christy.
  Positive
She asks all the existential questions any of us would in the midst of such a faith-testing trauma.
  Neutral
Faith is, of course, the crucial component here: the mystery of it, the need for it and ultimately the validation of it.
  Negative
From the title alone, its clear that faith will win out in the end.
  Positive
But the journey there takes some turns that feel mostly honest and true, which should make the movie universally relatable despite the unique and specific troubles the Beam family faced.
  Positive
The trailer pretty much tells the whole story, so there will be no spoilers here.
  Positive
But because we know what will happen at the outset, the challenge for director  Patricia Riggen is finding a source of tension to keep us emotionally engaged.
  Positive
Riggen tackled a similar prospect with last years  The , based on the true story of the Chilean miners who survived  days while trapped underground.
  Positive
Her approach, which is non-fussy and intimate, relies on the power of the human drama and its significant stakes.
  Very positive
At the films start, -year-old Anna  Kylie Rogers, showing not the slightest trace of child-actor precociousness is the middle child of three daughters in a loving and devoutly Christian home in Burleson, Texas, just south of Fort Worth.
  Negative
Shes a smart, confident kid with a passion for books and a yearning to visit Paris.
  Positive
But out of nowhere one night, shes violently vomiting, which leads to massive stomach pain, which leads to various doctors telling Christy and her veterinarian husband, Kevin  Martin Henderson, that its lactose intolerance or acid reflux or something else thats minor and treatable.
  Negative
But the pain doesnt go away.
  Negative
In fact, it gets worse.
  Negative
So Christys fierce maternal instinct inspires her to fly with Anna to Boston in hopes of seeing top pediatric gastroenterologist Dr. Samuel Nurko  Eugenio Derbez, whom shes been calling for months to schedule an appointment.
  Positive
When he eventually agrees to see them, he confirms what a local doctor  Bruce Altman, very good in a small role initially diagnosed: Anna is suffering from a severe and incurable intestinal motility disorder which makes eating impossible.
  Positive
From there, its a non-stop back-and-forth between Texas and Boston, with some painful moments involving feeding tubes as well as heavenly imagery of sunlight piercing fluffy, white clouds or the water where majestic creatures swim at the New England Aquarium.
  Negative
The films cinematographer,  Checco Varese, is Riggens husband.
  Negative
Miracles From Heaven wisely and efficiently depicts the toll Annas illness is taking on this once-idyllic home, with Kevin struggling to make ends meet and generally holding down the fort while Christy and Anna are away every six weeks.
  Negative
Back in Boston, an unlikely friendship the mother and daughter strike up with a big-hearted waitress  Queen Latifah would seem like a facile method of injecting comic relief except it really happened.
  Negative
But this bond, and several other acts of kindness that are revealed along the way, play neatly into the films central notion that miracles are everywhere, in the smallest, kindest gestures, which isnt exactly the worst message a movie can convey.
  Negative
One of the most poignant scenes is also one of the most understated as Anna and the young girl in the hospital bed next to her  Hannah Alligood, whos battling cancer, discuss whether theyre afraid of dying.
  Positive
The directness on display in Randy Brown's script, and in later scenes when Anna suffers from depression and Christy acknowledges that her faith is so shattered that she cant even pray anymore, represents a welcome balance of emotion and tone.
  Negative
Ultimately, though, the film is about the possibility of miracles.
  Neutral
The biggest and most bizarre of them all occurs back home when Anna has given up hope and reluctantly agrees to climb that big ol cottonwood tree in the familys front yard with her older sister, Abbie  Brighton Sharbino, one last time.
  Negative
The branch theyre sitting on gives way and she dives into the tree's hollow trunk for safety, only to plummet  feet to the ground and land on her head.
  Negative
Again, this is all in the trailer and in the book but in a seemingly implausible twist, not only does Anna survive the drop without a scratch, shes cured of her intestinal disease.
  Negative
She also emerges from the debacle with a vivid story about leaving her body and going to heaven, a place so vibrantly, colorfully pastoral youll swear youve seen it in countless commercials for allergy medication.
  Positive
Visual effects are not the films strong suit.
  Negative
There, God has told her shell be fine, and she should go home to her family.
  Positive
Impossible?
  Negative
Maybe.
  Neutral
But the film suggests that you can interpret this magical moment in any way you like, depending on your beliefs and needs and thats sort of miraculous in itself.
  Positive
