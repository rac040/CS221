While the idea of moving to Mars might not sound so terrible right about now, The Space Between Us is about a young man whos spent all of his  years on the red planet and cant wait to visit Earth specifically, to meet the cute high school girl with whom hes sparked an online flirtation.
  Negative
Trouble is, he may not physically be able to withstand the journey or last long once he gets here.
  Negative
Its kind of an intriguing premise, even if it plays a bit like a Muppet Babies version of  Starman, with an appealing lead performance from wide-eyed Brit  Asa Butterfield.
  Positive
But the sci-fimystery element of the film works far better than the romance between Butterfield and an annoyingly feisty  Britt Robertson as his interplanetary pen pal, and the whole thing ultimately collapses in a heap of unintentionally hilarious melodrama.
  Negative
Veterans like  Gary Oldman and  Carla Gugino bring flashes of dignity and sometimes even emotional truth to this frequently silly enterprise.
  Neutral
But like  Will Smith,  Kate Winslet,  Helen Mirren and  Naomie Harris surely found while making  Collateral Beauty theres only so much you can do with a soggy  Allan Loeb script.
  Negative
The twists are just unbearably ridiculous, which drains all the power out of their supposed catharsis.
  Very negative
Then again, awkward tonal shifts abound in the film from director  Peter Chelsom, known for such early-s misfires including Town amp' Country,  Serendipity and the English-language remake of Shall We Dance?
  Neutral
Chelsom, who also provides the voice of the boys wisecracking robot pal early on, cant quite make the transition from a character receiving terrible news to a joyous hot air balloon festival, for example.
  Negative
And a scene in which Robertsons fiercely independent foster-child character starts playing the piano and singing a ballad in the middle of a Sams Club shopping spree is more likely to prompt giggles than the poignancy for which it clearly aims.
  Negative
Theres reason for hope at the outset, though, simply through the involvement of Oldman.
  Very negative
He plays a Richard Branson-type billionaire explorer named Nathaniel Shepherd whos funding a mission to set up a colony on Mars called East Texas.
  Negative
Theres the glimmer of a notion that climate change is a motivating factor, but any sort of political underpinning quickly gets swept aside.
  Negative
But it turns out that the lead astronaut  Janet Montgomery was pregnant when she boarded the rocket' several months later, she dies during childbirth.
  Negative
Not a spoiler, folks it happens early in the movie.
  Negative
The ethical questions at stake are intriguing: whether Nathaniel and his team should report to the world that a boy has been born on Mars, or keep it a secret to avoid jeopardizing the mission.
  Positive
But thats about the extent of the intellectual ambitions at play here.
  Neutral
years later , the colony is thriving and the baby has grown into an inquisitive, slightly awkward young man named Gardner Elliot.
  Negative
Gugino plays the intelligent, supportive astronaut who was sent to East Texas to function as a mother figure to him.
  Negative
But Gardners daily chats with Robertsons character a similarly frustrated, isolated teen who goes by the nickname Tulsa make him increasingly curious about Earth.
  Negative
He also hopes to learn the identity of his father, whom hes seen in photos and snippets of home movies.
  Negative
Despite the physical toll it likely will take on him, Gardner makes the trek to Earth, where he promptly escapes his government handlers and seeks out Tulsa who lives in Colorado.
  Negative
Fish-out-of-water antics involving exotic phenomena like rain aim for easy, obvious laughs, but theyre vaguely amusing because of Butterfields pleasingly guileless persona.
  Negative
The two go on a road trip across the American West, stealing various cars and stopping in Las Vegas on the way to California, trying to outrun the authorities and his mounting health problems along the way.
  Negative
Which brings us to the multitude of distracting, inconsistent details.
  Negative
Its supposed to be  years in the future, right?
  Neutral
Some elements like laptops have a high-tech look about them, while others like dry erase boards in a classroom and old pickup trucks and cars are clearly from the present day or even a few decades ago.
  Negative
They make a big deal out of the fact that the beach house thats their ultimate destination is in the tiny beach town of Summerland, Calif. a few miles down the coast from Santa Barbara but then the authorities that arrive are from Los Angeles.
  Neutral
Stuff like this sticks out when youre not engaged emotionally in what is supposed to be the films dramatic climax.
  Negative
Butterfield and Robertson whos about  years too old to be playing a high-school student at this point dont exactly get sparkling dialogue with which to convince us of their burgeoning love.
  Positive
Neither does the score, which works overtime to make us feel all the feels.
  Neutral
But hey, at least theres an exploding barn.
  Negative
Thats something you dont see on Mars every day.
  Positive
