The allure of  The Girl on the Train was never the whodunit element of  Paula Hawkins hugely popular page-turner.
  Negative
It was the way in which Hawkins bounced around with time and narration between a trio of toxic women, all of whom were struggling with the increasing difficulty of maintaining the finely tuned facades theyd presented to the world.
  Negative
Theres Rachel, who gives the book its title.
  Neutral
Once a happily married publicist, she now looks longingly out the window as she commutes to and from the city twice a day, fantasizing about the seemingly perfect suburban lives she passes while sneaking sips of vodka to fend off the shakes.
  Negative
Theres Megan, the pretty blonde who lives in one of those comfortable houses.
  Positive
Working at an art gallery is one of the many ways this frequent liar and runaway has reinvented herself' she has a handsome husband and a cushy existence but shes restless and ready for another escape.
  Negative
Then theres Anna, whos now married to Rachels ex-husband and the mother of his infant daughter.
  Neutral
Coincidentally, she also happens to live in Rachels old house.
  Negative
But while she wallows smugly in maternal bliss, shes also bored and longs for the exciting, old days of being The Other Woman.
  Negative
With each chapter, Hawkins peeled away the layers of these characters, revealing their flaws and fears and providing varying and often unreliable perspectives as the novels torrid events unfolded.
  Negative
Not unlike  Gone Girl to which it invariably will draw comparisons as a juicy exploration of violence and mystery in genteel suburbia The Girl on the Train is good trash.
  Negative
At least as a novel, it is.
  Positive
As a film, however, its not even that.
  Neutral
Its just a flat and suspense-free tale of pretty people in peril.
  Negative
And not only is the whodunit part of the film not all that intriguing or surprising, neither are the characters swirling around each other until that big revelation comes to light.
  Negative
Tate Taylor blandly directs  Erin Cressida Wilsons adapted screenplay, which condenses these three women into a handful of traits rather than allowing them to be difficult and interesting.
  Negative
Taylor, who previously played it just as safe with his breakthrough film  The Help, doesnt alternate between these characters with the necessary fluidity or tension.
  Positive
His underrated Get on Up, featuring an electrifying performance from  Chadwick Boseman as  James Brown, had far more verve.
  Negative
The story comes together in pieces rather than jelling as a dynamic whole.
  Positive
And because these women have been so oversimplified, theres more of an emphasis on the fact that theyve all been defined by andor reliant on men.
  Negative
That wasnt necessarily true on the page, which seems especially unfortunate given that the novel The Girl on the Train ultimately is about women standing up for themselves, fighting together and finding their own identities.
  Neutral
And yet, there is  Emily Blunt, fighting as best she can to make Rachel complicated and compellingly damaged.
  Positive
The story has been moved from the outskirts of London to the leafy hamlets along the Hudson River in Westchester County, New York, but Blunt maintains her British accent.
  Negative
It makes Rachel an outsider from the start, and her near-constant, bleary-eyed inebriation exacerbates her loneliness and isolation.
  Neutral
In the book, Rachel is puffy and frumpy' Blunt is anything but.
  Negative
Shes game for the showiness of the role, though, with its raging nights and remorseful days.
  Negative
Rachel once had it all.
  Neutral
Now she obsesses over the lives of others as she spies them from the train.
  Neutral
Megan  Haley Bennett is her main target, kissing and canoodling with her hunky husband, Scott  Luke Evans.
  Negative
Rachel projects all her dreams onto them' meanwhile, a couple of houses away, Anna  Rebecca Ferguson also seems to be living a dream life with Rachels ex-husband, Tom  Justin Theroux.
  Negative
Conveniently, Megan happens to have been their nanny.
  Negative
But then suddenly, she goes missing and Rachel believes a glimpse of something she saw from the train might provide a crucial piece of information about her fate.
  Negative
Rachel also wonders whether she might have played a role herself, since she was blackout-drunk the night it happened.
  Positive
So she inserts herself into their lives and into the police investigation  Allison Janney is the much-needed voice of reason as the annoyed lead detective.
  Negative
Her stalking tendencies extend to Megans therapist  Edgar Ramirez, whos trotted out as one of many possible suspects in her disappearance.
  Negative
Rachels behavior seemed sad in its clingy desperation in the book, and the fact that she was grasping at wisps of her own alcohol-addled memory for clues made her a sympathetic figure.
  Negative
But in the movie, everything happens so quickly that her actions merely come off as bizarre and unintentionally funny.
  Negative
A couple instances of her running through the woods prompted giggles during the screening I attended, when Taylor probably was going for thrills and suspense.
  Positive
Also oddly, the men in the equation are afforded even less characterization, even though theyre the ones who dictate how the women feel about themselves.
  Negative
And so when The Girl on the Train finally answers the question of whodunit reliably, for once the result is more of a shrug than a shock.
  Negative
