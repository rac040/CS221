Imagine eating a giant bag of Skittles, then throwing it all up in a fit of sugar-induced nausea and youll have some idea of what it feels like to sit through My Little Pony: The Movie.
  Negative
Shrieky, garish and incessantly perky, the movie version of the long-running TV show My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic is unlikely to win any new converts.
  Negative
Its an animated film thats really intended for the littlest of little kids, who surely will respond to it on a primal, visceral level.
  Negative
This is probably an ideal first movie-going experience for young viewers in that its harmless, even though its terrible.
  Positive
My Little Pony also aims to stir some s nostalgia for a certain generation of adults in the audience  hence, the baffling array of random pop culture references, including a famous line from  Pretty Woman and a shameless plug for another Hasbro property, the Hungry Hungry Hippos game.
  Negative
Admittedly, this frothy confection is not my sparkly cup of tea.
  Negative
Im a little too old to have played with the toys as a kid' now, as a mom myself, I have an eight-year-old son who is definitely NOT a Brony.
  Negative
He attended a recent screening with me under vocal protest, despite my encouragement that he keep an open mind heading into the film, as is always our goal.
  Positive
Sorry, kid, I told him.
  Negative
Not everything can be Dunkirk.
  Negative
We wouldnt have known our Pinkie Pie from our Fluttershy if they came up and bit us on the butts which theyd never do, of course, because the pony pals are all about kindness and friendship.
  Negative
Now that weve spent a little time in the magical, rainbow-hued land of Equestria, however, we are unlikely to return.
  Negative
It is just mind numbing in its simplicity.
  Negative
But the folks behind the movie do deserve credit for remaining true to the fundamental elements of the Friendship is Magic television show, including admirably keeping the voice actors whove brought these characters to life for the past seven seasons.
  Positive
Longtime director  Jayson Thiessen and lead writer  Meghan McCarthy also made the leap from the series to the big screen.
  Positive
Rita Hsiao and  Michael Vogel share screenwriting credit.
  Positive
Despite that consistency, though, My Little Pony: The Movie simultaneously aims to expand its appeal by adding new characters to the ponyverse and casting well-known actors to play them.
  Negative
So while its themes of trust and teamwork are super basic, the narrative itself is all over the place, with a multitude of underdeveloped, crammed-in characters.
  Negative
Plus, every once in a while, the various animals burst into song, but not in any particularly memorable way.
  Negative
Although one peppy little ditty about being awesome was a toe-tapper, I will concede.
  Negative
Anyway, heres what its about: Twilight Sparkle voiced by  Tara Strong, the reliable leader of the group, is in the midst of planning some big friendship festival.
  Negative
But when a sinister force invades the land and kidnaps the reigning pony princesses to harness their power, Twilight Sparkle must go on a journey to save them, and their home, with help from her pals.
  Negative
They are: the colorful Rainbow Dash and the country girl Applejack both voiced by  Ashleigh Ball' the unflappably upbeat Pinkie Pie and the sensitive, timid Fluttershy both voiced by  Andrea Libman' the vamping, glamorous Rarity Tabitha St. Germain' and their wisecracking dragon sidekick, Spike  Cathy Weseluck.
  Negative
Theyre trying to outrun the villainous Tempest Shadow voiced by  Emily Blunt, a bitter unicorn with a broken horn whos doing the bidding of the evil but shticky Storm King  Liev Schreiber.
  Negative
Along the way, they run into a crew of one-time pirates who are now stuck working as messengers  Zoe Saldana provides the voice of their leader as well as a mother-daughter duo of seahorses in their hidden, underwater lair voiced by  Uzo Aduba and  Kristin Chenoweth.
  Negative
Theres also a sly cat  Taye Diggs who may or may not have the best intentions when he offers to help the ponies.
  Positive
And finally, theres  Sia.
  Positive
No really, its Sia in horse form, complete with the wig and everything.
  Negative
If youre having a hard time following this, its understandable.
  Negative
I watched the movie and Im still not entirely sure about everything that happened.
  Negative
But perhaps a movie about the transformative power of friendship even one as messy as this isnt the worst thing in the world right about now.
