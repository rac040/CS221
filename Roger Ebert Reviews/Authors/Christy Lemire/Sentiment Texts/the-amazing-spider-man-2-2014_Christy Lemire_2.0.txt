Heres a wild idea: Would it be possible to make a superhero movie and just take out all of the action sequences?
  Neutral
You know, just focus on the characters conflict the way he struggles to balance his public responsibilities with his private relationships?
  Negative
It would only be about an hour and a half long maybe  minutes, tops but it would be gripping, moving, even nourishing.
  Positive
Sundance-labbed Spider-Man.
  Neutral
Mumblecore Spider-Man.
  Neutral
Having endured "The Amazing Spider-Man ," thats the movie I would rather have seen.
  Negative
I recognize that this is a ridiculous proposal.
  Negative
These comics-inspired, effects-laden summer blockbusters are created to serve as an escape for international audiences.
  Positive
They are part of a franchise.
  Neutral
They are product.
  Neutral
They are drive-thru, fast-food cheeseburgers in cinematic form.
  Negative
See em in IMAX, and its like supersizing your order with curly fries on the side.
  Positive
Director  Marc Webbs follow-up to his entirely adequate " The Amazing Spider-Man" from  feels even more like its just been unloaded from the assembly line.
  Negative
The sporadic moments of recognizable human contact and emotion are the only ones in this latest episode of the soaring web slinger that truly take flight.
  Positive
I want Webbs "  Days of Summer" version of teenage superhero angst and it exists here, but only in glimmers.
  Negative
Instead, working with veteran screenwriters  Alex Kurtzman amp'  Roberto Orci " Star Trek," " Transformers" and  Jeff Pinkner TVs "Alias," "Lost", Webb gives us a film thats densely plotted sometimes confusingly so with set pieces so big and glossy, theyre depleted almost entirely of any connecting sensation.
  Negative
Spidey swings and swoops through the sky, gliding between tall buildings and around steep towers.
  Negative
Its sufficiently giddy at first but eventually grows repetitive and wearying, especially as more and more stuff gets blown up real good.
  Positive
Just when you think its over, theres another fight and another villain, another climax and another conclusion.
  Negative
The whole endeavor just drags on and on, and any momentary thrills you may have experienced have long since passed.
  Negative
Theres a lot going on here but very little thats truly compelling.
  Positive
Conversely, though, "The Amazing Spider-Man " is strongest when its at its quietest and most intimate.
  Positive
One revelatory exchange between  Andrew Garfields Peter Parker and  Sally Field as Peters Aunt May is so poignant, it made me want to cry.
  Negative
And every scene between Garfield and  Emma Stone as Peters sharp and assured girlfriend, Gwen Stacy, leaps off the screen.
  Positive
These are the real -D effects, the ones created by the flirty sparks between these two actors.
  Positive
Garfield gets to be a bit lighter and more playful this time around, but his inner struggle over the use of his arachnotastic powers and the larger consequences of them remain palpable.
  Neutral
What made his performance in the original "Amazing Spider-Man" work so well, and what made it such a pleasing difference from the way  Tobey Maguire played Peter Parker in  Sam Raimis " Spider-Man" trilogy, was his innate rebelliousness.
  Very positive
Garfields Peter already had a restless, restless streak in him a chip on his shoulder for his outsider status which made his choice to become a vigilante crime fighter make more sense.
  Negative
Here, Garfield is the cheeky, wisecracking superhero of Marvel Comic lore.
  Negative
He has become Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man.
  Positive
Yet the tag line on the movies posters and billboards says: "His greatest battle begins."
  Neutral
How many times can he have his first, greatest battle?
  Negative
Havent we already covered much of this territory?
  Negative
Once again, Peter is working through his daddy issues, searching for clues as to why his mysterious scientist father  Campbell Scott and mother  Embeth Davidtz left him to be raised by his aunt and uncle in blue-collar Queens when he was just a young boy.
  Negative
Once again, Peter reconnects with childhood friend Harry Osborn played in Raimis films by  James Franco, played here by a snaky  Dane DeHaan with dire consequences.
  Negative
Peter and Harrys past and future are as intrinsically tied as their fathers were' Harrys dad is, of course, the scheming industrial titan Norman Osborn, head of Oscorp played in Raimis films by  Willem Dafoe, played here with a last few gasps by  Chris Cooper, where Peter's father was a top researcher.
  Negative
The massive Manhattan skyscraper that houses Oscorp Headquarters represents all that is untrustworthy and duplicitous about corporate culture.
  Negative
Its also an unsafe work environment, it seems, as evidenced by the fate of  Jamie Foxxs character, engineer Max Dillon.
  Negative
Max is a nerdy stalker obsessed with Spider-Man and depressed by the tiniest perceived slight.
  Negative
In case you were wondering, playing a needy dweeb isnt the best fit for Foxxs considerable charisma.
  Negative
While working late one night, Max falls into a vat of electrified eels and becomes the high-voltage villain Electro although, with his pallid skin, hooded cloak and lightning bolts shooting from his fingers, Electro amusingly and distractingly resembles " Star Wars" uber-villain Darth Sidious.
  Negative
And so Peter must deal with Electro, as well as with the dark, destructive force Harry will become.
  Negative
Theres also a third bad guy waiting in the wings in the form of  Paul Giamatti, lumbering about Midtown in a giant, metal rhinoceros get-up.
  Negative
He goes by the name Rhino, in case youre unfamiliar with the canon.
  Negative
And hes kind of adorable.
  Positive
He also shows up so last minute, his inclusion feels like a wedged-in tease for the next installment which surely is unavoidable.
  Negative
But the more important battle occurs within Peter himself: whether to pursue his love for Gwen, knowing full well it was the wish of her late, police-officer father  Denis Leary that he stay away from her and keep her out of his mayhem.
  Negative
Gwen is actually the smartest and most interesting character here' confident and independent, she just graduated as the valedictorian of her high school class and shes on her way to London to study at Oxford.
  Positive
The insanely likable Stone makes her the coolest, most stylish brain imaginable.
  Positive
Perhaps in the low-budget, indie Spidey Im envisioning, the story can be told from Gwens perspective.
  Negative
