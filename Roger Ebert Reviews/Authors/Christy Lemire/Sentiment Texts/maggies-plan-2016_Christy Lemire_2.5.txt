Maggies Plan exists within a very specific, very recognizable cinematic realm: that of the intellectual, narcissistic New Yorker.
  Positive
Woody Allen established it'  Noah Baumbach modernized it.
  Positive
Now, writerdirector  Rebecca Miller is visiting it with often amusing but mixed results.
  Positive
Its a rare light comedy from Miller, best known for weighty dramas like  Personal Velocity and  The Ballad of Jack and Rose.
  Positive
But despite the machinations and manipulations of the films titular plot, Maggies Plan almost isnt screwball enough.
  Negative
The characters must undergo some introspection, as well, and striking a balance between those two dynamics proves challenging.
  Positive
Miller offers a vivid snapshot of a niche segment of New York, however.
  Positive
She truly gets the citys rhythms and idiosyncrasies, and her dialogue frequently sparkles.
  Positive
Her characters are self-serious academics who offer compliments like: Nobody unpacks commodity fetishism like you do.
  Negative
But she also finds room for quirky Brooklyn hipsters, including a self-titled pickle entrepreneur who would fit in just fine among the ironic Williamsburg crowd in Baumbachs While Were Young.
  Negative
Baumbachs muse and frequent collaborator,  Greta Gerwig, also gives the film a feeling of familiarity as the title character.
  Negative
Weve seen her play a version of Maggie many times before' it is her bread and butter.
  Neutral
Maggie is guileless and enthusiastic one sharp-tongued character aptly describes her as a little bit stupid which gives a purity to her fumbling attempts toward maturity and stability.
  Negative
Maggie works at The New School in an administrative position, as a bridge between art and commerce, as she puts it.
  Positive
Shes hopelessly single but yearns to have a child, so she procures a sample of sperm from an old college friend a likably low-key  Travis Fimmel, a math whiz and pickle-maker whos gentlemanly enough to offer to provide it the old-fashioned way.
  Negative
She politely declines.
  Positive
But Maggie becomes more emotionally entangled with the brilliant professor John Harding  Ethan Hawke, a renowned expert in the field of ficto-critical anthropology and a struggling novelist.
  Negative
She agrees to read his book a thinly-veiled depiction of his unhappy life with his even more brilliant wife, eccentric Danish academic Georgette  Julianne Moore, with whom he has two kids and she falls in love with it.
  Negative
In turn, John falls in love with Maggie although hes probably just in love with the way she makes him feel in comparison to his actual spouse, whos chilly and intimidating.
  Negative
With her tight top knot and comically thick accent, Moore at first seems to be doing a spoof of a self-serious European intellectual.
  Negative
But because she cant help but be excellent and provide insight into every character she plays, Moore reveals a vulnerability to Georgette thats surprisingly compelling.
  Positive
This is especially true in her scenes with Gerwig.
  Positive
The two actresses have vastly different on-screen personae Moore is all complex technique, Gerwig is all surface instinct but together, they create a connection thats unexpectedly pleasing and warm.
  Very positive
Cut to a few years later.
  Positive
John has left Georgette and married Maggie.
  Neutral
The two have a daughter together but also split time with Johns kids with Georgette  Mina Sundwall and  Jackson Frazer.
  Negative
They seem happy and Maggie is even thriving amid the chaos of balancing work and mothering three kids but it doesnt take long for John to wallow in misery once more.
  Negative
All this time later, he still hasnt finished the behemoth book that brought him and Maggie together in the first place.
  Negative
This makes Maggie begin to question her own happiness and question whether she even wants to be with John anymore.
  Positive
With the help of her more stable married best friends  Bill Hader and  Maya Rudolph, Maggie hatches a plan to get John and Georgette back together again.
  Negative
Hader and Rudolph, by the way, are the most interesting couple in the whole film no-nonsense and quick-witted but they dont get nearly enough screen time.
  Positive
I actually might have preferred an entire movie about them, instead.
  Negative
Its a scheme as old as the hills,downright Shakespearean in its potential for lively antics and wacky misunderstandings.
  Positive
Unfortuantely, Miller dials it down and taps into everyones insecurities and existential crises, detrimentally draining the film of energy when it should be building to a climax.
  Positive
Its a bold tonal decision, to be sure, but not unlike the plan in Maggies Plan it doesnt quite turn out as expected.
  Negative
