Its doubtful anyone expected that  Think Like a Man would be the hit that it was in .
  Negative
Based on  Steve Harveys kinda-sorta self-help book titled Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man, the movie featured a great-looking and magnetic ensemble of actors and actresses in wacky, hackneyed, battle-of-the-sexes scenarios.
  Negative
It grossed almost  million worldwide.
  Negative
It also made a superstar out of diminutive, quick-talking comedian Kevin Hart.
  Negative
Two years later, we have Think Like a Man Too, a sequel that screams cashing in again.
  Neutral
From the half-heartedly clever spelling of Too in the title to the overly familiar Las Vegas setting to the complete breaks in narrative for music-video style interludes, everything about this film smacks of laziness.
  Negative
The one person working hard, because it is his shtick, is Hart.
  Negative
A little bit of his act goes a long way' here, his frantic presence is stretched thin to the point of snapping.
  Negative
In the first film which, like this one, was directed by  Tim Story Hart was an enjoyable scene-stealer in small, sporadic doses.
  Positive
He then went on to re-team with Story in this winters formulaic, mismatched-buddy-cop comedy  Ride Along opposite  Ice Cube.
  Negative
Now, in this sequel, hes not just part of the group, hes the narrator and driving force.
  Negative
Hart takes over duties from Harvey, smothering the film with amped-up voiceover that over-explains the films wacky romantic shenanigans, which werent all that complicated in the first place.
  Positive
Usually he does this with tortured, extended basketball metaphors about the teams being tied because its the eternal struggle of men vs. women, hardy har har or the beauty of an off-balance, fade-away jumper.
  Negative
As contrived as it all sounds, there is an actual reason for all the characters from the first film to reassemble for part two courtesy of returning writers  Keith Merryman and  David A. Newman: Mamas boy Michael Terrence J and single mom Candace  Regina Hall are getting married.
  Negative
Although Mama herself, played once again by a withering  Jenifer Lewis, keeps trying to get between them in stereotypical fashion.
  Negative
All the sources of tension that defined the other characters neediness, fear of commitment, balancing career and romance have dissipated.
  Negative
The men and women are all coupled up and happy.
  Positive
So whats left to do with them now?
  Negative
Not much, it seems, except allow them to wallow in clichd Vegas antics.
  Negative
Media exec Lauren  Taraji P. Henson has planned a wild bachelorette party for Candace and their pals: dress designer Mya Meagan Good, new wife Kristen  Gabrielle Union and the random Sonia LaLa Anthony, whos thrown into the mix as an afterthought.
  Negative
Meanwhile, Harts overzealous Cedric has secured a luxury suite at Caesars Palace and planned a crazy night for the groom and their buddies: laid-back chef Dominic  Michael Ealy, ladies man Zeke  Romany Malco and stoner Jeremy  Jerry Ferrara.
  Negative
Also along for the ride are  Gary Owen and Wendi McLendon-Covey as Bennett and Tish, the token, dorky white couple, complete with fanny pack for him and sweater sets for her.
  Negative
Naturally, they will learn to let loose and get their freak on in various capacities.
  Negative
But all these folks are pretty bland, really' then again, even gorgeous, charismatic actors like these can get steamrolled when Hart is around.
  Positive
And there are so many returning players combined with several new supporting characters that everyone gets lost in the shuffle if youll pardon the inadvertent gambling pun.
  Negative
Theres no real plot here' no sense of narrative progression.
  Negative
Story moves them from the pool to the blackjack table to the dance floor to the strip club and, eventually, jail.
  Neutral
Details and plot points that seem to matter in the moment fall by the wayside: the flashy, orange Lamborghini Cedric is driving when he pulls up to the hotels valet parking, for example, or the bash he plans in the ,-a-night suite he can't afford.
  Negative
He secures a stripper pole for the room, hands out flyers and everything.
  Negative
Does it even go down?
  Negative
Do random strangers show up at the door and wonder what happened?
  Negative
None of it seems to matter.
  Negative
The best sequence in the whole film has very little to do with the nuptials at hand.
  Positive
Its a full-length music video for Bell Biv Devoes kitschy, catchy,  hit Poison, complete with all the stylistic details of the Ramp'Bhip-hop clips from that era.
  Negative
Clad in sexy, sparkly nightclub dresses, the ladies writhe seductively on couches or mug ferociously before fish-eye lenses.
  Negative
They seem to be seizing the reins and enjoying themselves genuinely for the first time.
  Positive
They do the ENTIRE song.
  Neutral
Its a jubilant departure but its also a glaring reminder of how little else the film has to offer.
  Negative
And its enough to make you wish Michael and Candace had just eloped.
