Berlin Syndrome will make you question any wanderlust-inspired notions you may have of traveling alone to a foreign country on a quest for self-discovery.
  Neutral
Australian director  Cate Shortland creates a dreamlike sense of place within a nightmare scenario with this taut and strongly acted thriller.
  Positive
Working from a script by  Shaun Grant, based on a novel of the same name by  Melanie Joosten, Shortland has essentially crafted a claustrophobic two-hander with only occasional forays into the outside world.
  Negative
The dynamic is constantly changing within the central romance gone wrong' the power shifts back and forth between hunter and prey, keeper and captive.
  Neutral
And while Shortland takes her time perhaps too indulgently and would have benefited from tightening up the pacing especially in the lengthy, languid midsection Berlin Syndrome remains consistently compelling.
  Positive
Much of that has to do with the presence of star  Teresa Palmer, the Australian beauty believably de-glammed with dark, red hair and a palpable sense of vulnerability.
  Positive
Palmer plays Clare, a Brisbane photographer whos visiting Berlin to shoot the citys architecture.
  Negative
But shes in a state of flux personally, which makes her easy pickings when she accidentally bumps into the charming and handsome Andi  Max Riemelt on the street.
  Positive
Do you like strawberries?
  Neutral
They make you forget your problems, Andi asks Clare flirtatiously, offering her a piece of proverbial forbidden fruit from a basket hes holding.
  Negative
With his adorable accent, playful sense of humor and just the right amount of facial scruff, hes like a German  Charlie Hunnam.
  Positive
And although he comes off as a sweet and trustworthy high school English teacher, subtle visual cues and the way he eventually seduces her suggest something sinister lurking beneath.
  Positive
She may not sense trouble, but we do.
  Neutral
As Andi and Clare spend a couple afternoons and evenings exploring Berlin, Shortland uses gauzy visuals and slow motion to capture the disorienting, intoxicating sensation of discovering a new place and a new person.
  Positive
But Clare doesnt really know Andi or anyone else in the city, or even the language, for that matter when she finally goes home with him to his modest apartment.
  Negative
The unsettling, electronic score from  Bryony Marks provides a tense undertone as hes undressing and pleasuring her.
  Negative
What should be sexy and thrilling ends up being eerie and frightening.
  Positive
And were just getting started.
  Neutral
Without giving away too much, lets just say Andi isnt all that keen on letting Clare leave the next morning.
  Negative
The realization that shes trapped in this crappy place with this charismatic stranger sinks in over the next couple of days, and Palmers quietly tearful, jittery reaction is just chilling.
  Very negative
So is Riemelts comparative calm which makes him that much scarier as a villain.
  Negative
He goes about his regular schedule at school.
  Positive
He stops by the grocery store on the way home.
  Neutral
Days turn to weeks turn to months.
  Neutral
But whats fascinating about Berlin Syndrome a title thats a take-off on the concept of Stockholm syndrome is the way the relationship evolves over that time.
  Positive
Much of what Andi does to Clare is incredibly hard to watch, and Shortland is matter-of-fact and up-close-and-personal in the way she depicts the pain he inflicts on her.
  Positive
She also makes great use of this confined space.
  Positive
Eventually, though, a warped sense of domesticity emerges.
  Negative
He brings her little gifts.
  Positive
He bathes her and cuts her hair.
  Positive
Hes like a needy little boy seeking maternal approval.
  Negative
And the fact that your feelings toward Andi might change over the course of the film is a testament to the assured, nuanced performance Riemelt gives.
  Positive
What Palmer does is an even trickier feat to pull off.
  Negative
Shes tasked with creating a character with an ever-changing mental state and doing it almost wordlessly.
  Negative
Shes also alone on camera a lot of the time in just a few rooms' there are no flashbacks to her youth in Australia to give us a sense of what shaped her or what matters to her.
  Negative
Palmer lets us know who this person is by the way she reacts in an extraordinary circumstance the way she kills time by herself, and the way she thinks on the fly to survive once Andi returns.
  Positive
It must have been a huge challenge both physically and psychologically, and its never short of riveting.
  Negative
