In February , Ukrainian ballet superstar  Sergei Polunin appeared in an emotionally raw music video for the huge Hozier hit Take Me to Church.
  Negative
The clip, which famed photographer  David LaChapelle shot in Hawaii, featured Polunin dancing in a stripped-down space in ripped, nude tights, his sinewy body covered in the tattoos he usually has to hide with makeup to perform the classic roles.
  Negative
The choreography revealed a conflicted dancers torment' the melody inspired a gifted artist to soar.
  Positive
And the fact that LaChapelle shot so much of the performance from low angles with heavenly streaks of sunlight streaming through open windows made Polunins leaps seem to last even longer.
  Negative
If youd never seen or heard of him before this, you could never forget him afterward.
  Negative
His combination of explosive power and aerial prowess made the video go viral, and as of this writing its amassed nearly  million views.
  Negative
But Polunin intended Take Me to Church to serve as his swan song, even though he was only .
  Negative
Having reached the heights of ballet at an astonishingly young age and realizing his heart no longer was in it, the media-hyped bad boy considered this shoot a farewell to the art form that brought him fame and acclaim.
  Negative
Trouble is, the video made him even more popular.
  Negative
And thats where documentary Dancer comes in: to explore the paradox of having it all and still not feeling satisfied.
  Negative
Director  Steven Cantor provides intimate access to Polunin in all his shadings, from playful to petulant.
  Positive
Cantor knows a little something about challenging celebrities, having previously co-directed the excellent Pixies documentary loudQUIETloud, among many others.
  Positive
He also benefits from the fact that video technology has been available throughout Polunins life despite a childhood spent in poverty in southern Ukraine so we see footage of him training to be an Olympic gymnast at age six, then pirouetting longer and jumping higher than the other boys in his ballet classes as a pre-teen.
  Positive
Cantor also speaks with Polunins parents and grandmothers, all of whom are matter-of-fact about splitting up the family and moving to different countries for work to help nurture their prodigy.
  Positive
While they were united in their love and support of their son, his parents ended up divorcing over the geographical divide.
  Neutral
At , Polunin moved on his own to London to study with the British Royal Ballet School without knowing a word of English' at , he became the Royal Ballets youngest-ever principal dancer.
  Negative
But by , he walked away from the company, feeling restrained by the routine.
  Negative
He had plenty of friends video clips show them partying hard well into the night, and tabloid reports wallow in tales of his wild ways but his sense of isolation is obvious.
  Negative
And the same swagger that makes him sexy and seductive on stage makes him demanding and dismissive off of it.
  Negative
Who Polunin truly is and what drives him remain somewhat elusive in Dancer, though.
  Negative
Maybe thats the point, or maybe those sorts of things are difficult to pin down as Polunin himself continues to forge an identity of his own.
  Negative
But its the one element that makes this documentary feel like a less-than-complete experience.
  Negative
Cantor deserves credit, however, for tracking the self-destruction without gawking or clucking' he seems to feel sympathy for this frustrated artist in flux.
  Negative
Unlike so many movies about ballet, Dancer isnt about the toll such discipline takes on the body.
  Negative
Its about the toll it takes on a life.
  Positive
But still, there is the dancing.
  Neutral
Good lord, does he dazzle.
  Positive
Seeing how freakishly gifted he is and watching his ascendance is a thrill, and Cantor keeps the pacing moving crisply.
  Positive
And there is an emotional underpinning, as well.
  Positive
While the film reveals unmistakable traces of remorse in Polunins more recent interactions with his mother, who sacrificed everything for him, it ends on a note of uplift.
  Negative
Despite the rage of the Take Me to Church video, Dancer suggests theres hope for happiness yet.
