Traces of  Gus Van Sant abound, both visually and thematically but thats not such a bad thing.
  Negative
As You Are jumps around in time between the events that bring together three very different high school students and the police investigation into the tragedy that tears them apart.
  Negative
Videotaped,  Rashomon-style interviews with an unseen detective provide a variety of perspectives into the relationship between these kids as well as their reticent recollections of how things went wrong.

Loner Jack  Owen Campbell of The Americans spends his days wandering the school hallways, skateboarding and watching television alone.
  Negative
He lives in a modest house in a middle-class neighborhood on the outskirts of Albany, N.Y., with his single mom, Karen, played by  Mary Stuart Masterson.
  Negative
Yes, if you feel like realizing how old you are, Mary Stuart Masterson is now the mother in angsty high school movies.
  Negative
Joris-Peyrafitte creates a vivid sense of place, and Jacks isolation within it is palpable and yet, when he smiles at his mom, a boyish sweetness shines through.
  Positive
Things start looking up when Karen introduces Jack to her new boyfriend, Tom  Scott Cohen, and his teenage son, Mark  Charlie Heaton of Stranger Things, eerily reminiscent of peak  River Phoenix who probably would have played this role himself if the film had been made during its early-s setting.
  Negative
The new kid in town, Mark is everything Jack isnt: talkative, brash and dangerous.
  Negative
Their initial friendship, born of proximity, soon turns into a makeshift family when Tom and Mark move into Karen and Jacks already cramped home.

Clearly, this will not end well.
  Negative
Its nice for a while, though.
  Positive
Joris-Peyrafitte makes evocative use of slow motion to hold a moment and an emotion in time.
  Positive
And his camerawork is inspired throughout, with impressive, long tracking shots, unexpected manipulation of aspect ratio and clever angles, especially during a game of Spin the Bottle.
  Positive
He knows when to be show-offy and he knows when to be still, especially when it comes to the lovely, emotionally honest scenes between Campbell and Heaton.
  Positive
But whatever sense of hope As You Are may offer, its always tinged with tension, because we know something has disrupted this youthful idyll.
  Negative
The title, by the way, is a reference to the Nirvana song Come As You Are, with  Kurt Cobain serving as a beacon to these music-obsessed, frustrated teens.
  Negative
Joris-Peyrafitte and co-writer  Madison Harrison have created sharply drawn characters for their well-chosen cast for the most part.
  Positive
Cohen, as Marks dad, is a one-dimensional, abusive blowhard.
  Negative
And while the actual act that destroys this tender friendship might seem a bit anticlimactic, the build-up to it is filled with moments that will make you hold your breath to avoid disrupting their delicacy and truth.
  Positive
Its an exciting debut from an extremely promising, young filmmaker.
  Very positive
