Theres minimalist filmmaking thats quietly intriguing, and then theres emotional detachment thats stultifying to the point of being nap-inducing.
  Positive
"War Story" falls into the latter category.
  Negative
Director  Mark Jacksons drama is a chilly study in grief starring  Catherine Keener as a war-zone photographer shattered by her experiences in Libya.
  Neutral
But Jackson and co-writer  Kristin Gore have structured the film as a mystery, so we dont really know who Keeners character is or what happened to her until about an hour into the -minute running time.
  Positive
Instead, Keeners Lee smokes and sulks.
  Negative
She pops pills and avoids calls from her editor.
  Positive
She holes up in the darkness of a sparse Sicilian hotel room that she insists the maid shouldnt clean.
  Negative
Actually, all of her interactions with other people are uniformly terse.
  Negative
When she does leave the room, bleary-eyed, Jackson follows her in long, Dardennes-style tracking shots down bland hotel hallways and through cloudy city streets.
  Negative
There is a numbing evenness in tone to every place she goes and everything she does.
  Negative
Certainly, a film about a woman suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder shouldnt be a laugh riot, but it should at least offer some glimmers of humanity to engage us and keep us hanging on.
  Positive
War Story is all about withholding key information, but its too languid to be engrossing in the first place.
  Negative
It takes an awfully long time to establish Lees isolation' the first  minutes are essentially wordless.
  Very negative
All kinds of choices are baffling here, beginning with the placement of Keener in this kind of role.
  Negative
So much of what has made her so appealing for so long especially in her work with  Spike Jonze and Nicole Holofcener is a zesty naturalism, a directness and an earthiness that allow her to make an instant connection, regardless of the character.
  Positive
All of that has been stripped away here, and whats left is a dour shell.
  Very negative
But Lee thinks she may have found her salvation when she meets Hafsia  Hafsia Herzi, a troubled, young refugee in need of an abortion.
  Negative
Hafsia happens to resemble a young woman in Libya whom she photographed mourning over the body of her slain brother.
  Negative
In this doppelganger, Lee sees an opportunity for spiritual redemption  or perhaps just a distraction from her own troubles.
  Negative
Their relationship is vague as is so much else in the film, but eventually it seems to border on co-dependency, with the two women hiding together in the hotel room and even sharing the same bed, platonically.
  Negative
Even the introduction of Hafsia doesnt liven things up' shes as low-key and enigmatic as Lee is.
  Positive
A meeting with a longtime friend and colleague finally sheds some light on Lees plight.
  Positive
Hes played by a barely-there  Ben Kingsley in a massive waste of a towering talent.
  Negative
Speaking of baffling decisions, Kingsley is basically on screen for about five minutes, and when we first see him meeting up with Keener, its from a distance at a high angle.
  Neutral
Their discussion takes place in a dark room in one long, extremely backlit take.
  Negative
This is supposed to be one of the most significant moments in the film but because of these aesthetic choices, it just doesnt register.
  Negative
Kingsleys single scene makes you long for more of him' hes a forceful presence in a film desperately in need of them.
  Neutral
Perhaps Jackson is trying to recreate for us as viewers the foggy, drug-induced state in which Lee has placed herself as a means of protection or denial or self-soothing.
  Neutral
Its hard to figure it out, as is the intentionally abrupt, open-ended conclusion which feels like a slap in the face after enduring such a slog.
  Negative
