The first time we see  Michael Keaton in his tighty-whities in Birdman, its from behind.
  Negative
His character, a formerly high-flying movie star, is sitting in the lotus position in his dressing room of a historic Broadway theatre, only hes levitating above the ground.
  Negative
Bathed in sunlight streaming in from an open window, he looks peaceful.
  Negative
But a voice inside his head is growling, grumbling, gnawing at him grotesquely about matters both large and small.
  Negative
The next time we see Keaton in his tighty-whities in Birdman, hes dashing frantically through Times Square at night, having accidentally locked himself out of that same theatre in the middle of a performance of a  Raymond Carver production that he stars in, wrote and directed.
  Negative
Hes swimming upstream through a river of gawking tourists, autograph seekers, food carts and street performers.
  Negative
But despite the chaos that surrounds him, he seems purposeful, driven andfor the first timeoddly content.
  Negative
These are the extremes that director Alejandro G. Inarritu navigates with audacious ambition and spectacular skill in Birdmanthe full title of which is Birdman or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance.
  Positive
Hes made a film thats both technically astounding yet emotionally rich, intimate yet enormous, biting yet warm, satirical yet sweet.
  Very positive
Its also the first time that Inarritu, the director of ponderous downers like  Babel and  Biutiful, actually seems to be having some fun.
  Positive
Make that a ton of fun.
  Positive
Birdman is a complete blast from start to finish.
  Negative
The gimmick hereand its a doozy, and it works beautifullyis that Inarritu has created the sensation that you are watching a two-hour film shot all in one take.
  Positive
Working with the brilliant and inventive cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki who won an Oscar this year for shooting  Gravity for Inarritus close friend and fellow Mexican director  Alfonso Cuaron, Inarritu has constructed the most delicate and dazzling high-wire act.
  Very positive
And indeed, before shooting began, the director sent his cast a photo of Philippe Petit walking a tightrope between the World Trade Center towers as inspiration.
  Negative
Through impossibly long, intricately choreographed tracking shots, the camera swoops through narrow corridors, up and down tight stairways and into crowded streets.
  Negative
It comes in close for quiet conversations and soars between skyscrapers for magical-realism flights of fancy.
  Neutral
A percussive and propulsive score from Antonio Sanchez, heavy on drums and cymbals, maintains a jazzy, edgy vibe throughout.
  Very positive
Sure, you can look closely to find where the cuts probably happened, but that takes much of the enjoyment out of it.
  Negative
Succumbing to the thrill of the experience is the whole point.
  Positive
Just as thrilling is the tour-de-force performance from Keaton in the role of a lifetime as Riggan Thompson, a washed-up actor trying to regain the former glory he achieved as the winged action hero Birdman.
  Negative
The film follows the fraught early going of his Broadway debut which is also his last shot at greatnessalthough his on-screen alter ego doesnt help much by voicing his fears and making him doubt himself incessantly.
  Negative
Yes, its knowingly amusing that Keaton, who peaked -plus years ago as a superhero, is playing an actor who peaked -plus years ago as a superhero.
  Positive
Although Id happily argue that Keatons Batman for  Tim Burton in  is THE definitive performance of the iconic characterbut thats a whole nother conversation for another time.
  Negative
Or is it?
  Neutral
While Birdman exists in its own meticulously realized world, its very much of this time and place from a pop-culture perspective, with references to other real-life actors like  Robert Downey Jr. and  Michael Fassbender whove enjoyed enormous success when theyve donned the superhero duds.
  Positive
The script from Inarritu,  Nicolas Giacobone, Alexander Dinelaris and  Armando Bo is cleverly meta without being too cutesy and self-satisfied.
  Negative
Keaton gets to toy with his persona a bitas well as acknowledge how comparatively quiet his career has been in recent yearsbut seeing him in seasoned form provides its own joy.
  Positive
Hes still hyper-verbal and playful and he can still be amusing and lacerating in his delivery, but theres a wry wistfulness and even a desperation in the mix now thats achingly poignant.
  Positive
Also confronting his real-life reputation is  Edward Norton as Mike Shiner, the brilliant but infamously capricious actor who steps in as Riggans co-star just as previews are about to begin on his labor-of-love production of What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.
  Positive
Norton, whos come with the baggage of being difficult and demanding over the years, finds just the right balance between arrogance and sincerity.
  Negative
Besides, they need each other, as they find in the days leading up to opening night.
  Negative
They all need each other.
  Neutral
Inarritu has amassed a tremendous supporting cast and made ridiculous technical demands of them, yet theyve all more than risen to the occasion and relished the chance to shine.
  Negative
Zach Galifianakis plays strongly against type as Riggans manager and the rare voice of reason in the middle of all this madness.
  Negative
Emma Stone is adorable as Riggans world-weary, wise-ass daughter who also serves as his assistant.
  Negative
She and Norton have crackling chemistry in a couple of crucial scenes.
  Positive
Amy Ryan does wonders with her brief screen time as Riggans ex-wife' she fleshes him out and allows us to see both the selfish and the good in him.
  Positive
And  Naomi Watts, who starred in Inarritus wrenching   Grams, gets to play both light and heavy moments as a neurotic fellow cast member.
  Negative
Its powerfully clear that they all worked their asses of to make this complicated thrill ride look effortless.
  Positive
The result is one of the best times youll have at the movies this yearwhich might even be the best movie this year.
  Very positive
