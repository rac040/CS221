Brads Status might be the most  Ben Stillerish movie Ben Stiller has ever made, and thats actually a good thing.
  Positive
The actor and director has made much of his career out of playing comically miserable men: self-centered, frustrated, passive-aggressively perturbed.
  Negative
In films including While Were Young,  Greenberg and to an extent the Meet the Parents franchise, these are arrogant characters who are easy to laugh at but difficult to like.
  Negative
Writerdirector  Mike White recognizes that innate contradiction and reconciles it in the biting satire Brads Status, giving Stiller a juicy role thats sharply funny and surprisingly poignant.
  Positive
Despite the specific nature of the character Stiller plays, Brads Status finds a universality in the uncomfortable truths it explores: the human tendency to take stock, especially around middle age, and to compare our lives against both our friends achievements and our youthful visions of our future selves.
  Negative
Brads not terribly happy with his status these days as he heads to New England to visit colleges with his teenage son, Troy  Austin Abrams.
  Negative
He has a comfortable life in Sacramento with his loving, easygoing wife, Melanie  Jenna Fischer, and a job running a non-profit, an extension of his lifelong idealism.
  Positive
Troy, a musical prodigy, is a thoughtful, talented kid with an obviously bright future a legitimate contender for elite universities like Harvard, Yale and Tufts.
  Very positive
None of it is good enough, though.
  Positive
Rather than be purely proud and excited for his son, Brad uses the occasion to obsess over the successes of his own college friends, all of whom are doing far better than he is in his estimation.
  Negative
Billy  Jemaine Clement lives a life of hedonism in Hawaii after selling his tech company and retiring at age .
  Neutral
Jason  Luke Wilson is a jet-setting hedge fund manager who married into money.
  Negative
Nick White himself enjoys lavish luxury as a Hollywood director.
  Positive
But the one that kills Brad is Craig  Michael Sheen, an influential author and political pundit who teaches at Harvard and who he finds he needs a favor from, leading to the films most exquisitely acted scene.
  Negative
With efficiency and great detail, White lays out who these guys are, as well as who theyve truly become compared to Brads inflated ideas of them.
  Positive
And we know how Brad feels about everyone around him all the time because he tells us in copious voiceover.
  Negative
Its a device that seems smothering at first a narrative crutch, even.
  Negative
But in time, it becomes clear that its meant to illuminate the divide between Brads perceptions and reality, between his insecurities and his neurotic analysis of those insecurities.
  Negative
Brad also wrestles internally with how he feels about his sons future, which manifests itself in such erratic ways that Troy rightly wonders whether hes having a nervous breakdown.
  Negative
He alternates between reveling in the expected, reflected glory of his sons potential and dwelling on the possibility that hell be too consumed by jealousy to be proud of him.
  Negative
In the vein of his previous screenplays for  Chuck and Buck,  The Good Girl and  Beatriz at Dinner, White depicts the darker side of human nature with deadpan humor and daring honesty.
  Positive
Abrams consistently calm, grounded presence provides an intriguing chemistry with Stillers tightly coiled demeanor.
  Positive
The young actor more than holds his own opposite his veteran co-star in scenes that are both quietly tense and unexpectedly lovely.
  Positive
Fischers role, meanwhile, feels underdeveloped beyond functioning as the supportive wife and mother.
  Negative
But the films other main female character serves as its much-needed voice of reason:  Shazi Raja as a musician friend of Troys whos already studying at Harvard.
  Negative
Vivacious, intelligent and beautiful, shes a reminder of the person Brad always wanted to be but shes also clear-eyed and confident enough to tell him the truth about himself, whether or not hes prepared to hear it.
  Very positive
She makes a devastating impression on him and us in just a couple of scenes.
  Neutral
Woven throughout is  Mark Mothersbaughs discordant score, which grabs you from the start and provides the perfect accompaniment for the story of a man who takes himself far too seriously.
  Positive
Stripped down with staccato strings, its playfully melodramatic, an arch acknowledgement of the white, male privilege on display.
  Negative
By the end, Brads status hasnt changed much, but theres vague hope that he might strive for something resembling contentment.
  Negative
