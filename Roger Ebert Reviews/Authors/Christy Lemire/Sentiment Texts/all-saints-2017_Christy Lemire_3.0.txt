All Saints feels like a bit of a miracle.
  Positive
Its a faith-based movie inspired by a true story that lets its dramatic moments unfold without relying on melodrama.
  Positive
And while its characters speak frequently of the power of prayer and signs from God, All Saints isnt preachy or heavy-handed from a biblical perspective, which might make it more accessible than other films of its ilk to viewers from a variety of religious backgrounds or lack thereof.
  Negative
Director  Steve Gomer approaches dire and potentially devastating situations in understated fashion, allowing the purity of their prevailing humanity to shine through.
  Positive
This tale of a rural church that came back from the brink of collapse about a decade ago is full of highs and lows, hopes and disappointments.
  Negative
But a well-chosen cast, led by a hugely appealing  John Corbett, keeps the material emotionally grounded.
  Positive
Corbett stars as Michael Spurlock, a former paper salesman whos recently followed his calling to be a pastor.
  Negative
For his first big assignment, the diocese sends him and his family to All Saints Episcopal Church in Smyrna, Tennessee, just outside of Nashville.
  Negative
The church is broke and membership is dwindling' Michael is there to inventory the property and oversee its sale to make way for a big-box store.
  Negative
Michael promises his bored son, Atticus Myles Moore, that itll only be a couple months, while his former journalist wife, Aimee  Cara Buono, tries to make the most of it by starting a choir.
  Negative
Meanwhile, skeptical locals led by a cantankerous Vietnam veteran a perfectly cast  Barry Corbin dont exactly welcome the family with open arms.
  Positive
Clearly, a Capra-esque change of heart is in store for everyone, otherwise thered be no movie.
  Negative
But the road there isnt nearly as predictable as you might expect from the outset in the script from  Steve Armour.
  Negative
All Saints may seem a bit sitcom-y off the top as it affectionately plays up the folksiness of these small-town folks.
  Negative
Gomer has a lengthy history of directing dramatic TV, and it shows in some of the pacing and unfussy camerawork.
  Negative
And its clear that Michael was a bit show-offy and insubordinate in his previous career, which threatens to manifest itself in his newer, humbler profession and set up a wacky culture clash.
  Negative
But as the story settles into a groove and its central conflict develops, it becomes unexpectedly compelling.
  Positive
A week away from the churchs scheduled demolition, dozens of refugees from war-torn Burma arrive.
  Negative
They are ethnic Karen farmers with no money and no place to go, and their leader, the kind and thoughtful Ye Win an excellent  Nelson Lee, is one of the few who speak English.
  Positive
Soon afterward, Michael believes he hears the voice of God telling him to fight for All Saints by having the Karen stay and farm the land surrounding it, providing them with food and shelter and creating much-needed income for the church.
  Neutral
Intriguingly, though, others wonder whether Michael is truly hearing the voice of God and not just the sound of his own savior complex, including his boss, the no-nonsense bishop Gregory  Alan Williams.
  Neutral
Its one of many examples of characters questioning the will of the Lord and their own faith in conversations that feel refreshingly honest, direct and heartfelt.
  Positive
In executing their plan to plant tomatoes, corn and other vegetables, Michael and his team hit more than a few snags, and even some of their triumphs end up being short-lived.
  Negative
But they persevere through the power of community which may sound hokey, but Gomers wise restraint makes it ring true.
  Positive
Corbett finds just the right tone in every situation, too, from charmingly swaggering to quietly searching.
  Positive
He enjoys great chemistry with Corbin as well as a nice Northern Exposure reunion, who steals every scene hes in whether hes ranting or serving as a seasoned voice of reason.
  Positive
And, as Michaels wife, Buono gets a chance to show spine and shading rather than functioning as just the dutiful, supportive spouse.
  Negative
Adding to the feeling of authenticity, All Saints was shot at the actual All Saints church in Smyrna, with several real-life parishioners playing themselves.
  Negative
And if this small, sweet movie opens peoples eyes to the importance of welcoming refugees in need especially during a time when notions of rejecting them unfortunately are taking hold well, thats just an added blessing.
  Negative
