A plucky underdog athlete makes his way to the  Winter Olympics in Calgary with the help of a former American sporting great whos now languishing in disgrace.
  Negative
Ill-prepared and poorly dressed, he nevertheless has enough heart and perseverance to prove to his naysayers that he deserves to compete alongside the worlds best.
  Neutral
Slapstick mishaps and ultimately feel-good triumph of sorts ensue, with plenty of perky training montages in between.
  Positive
This is the premise of Eddie the Eagle and, with a few detail tweaks here and there, pretty much every other sports movie known to mankind.
  Positive
But in an odd bit of coincidence, it describes almost to a T s  Cool Runnings, the story of the unlikely Jamaican bobsled team which also competed at the  Winter Games.
  Negative
Its formulaic schmaltz is pure as the driven snow.
  Positive
And it's a shame that a movie about a man with zero athletic ability, who had the fearlessness to attempt a perilous -meter ski jump for the first time ever in front of a rapt Olympic audience, takes no chances.
  Negative
Taron Egerton  Kingsman: The Secret Service stars as Michael  Eddie Edwards, a working-class, weakling Brit whose dream since boyhood was to be an Olympian, despite suffering from leg and knee ailments.
  Negative
Following several failed attempts to excel at track and field, he turned his attention toward winter sports and became an unexpectedly solid downhill skier until the posh snobs on the British team kept him out of the  games.
  Very negative
Frankly, Eddie, you will never be Olympic material, a British team executive tells him, condescendingly.
  Negative
Its a frequent refrain hes heard throughout his life: Edday, you ah not an afflete, says his singularly gruff and disapproving dad  Keith Allen.
  Negative
Mum in her mom jeans  Jo Hartley, meanwhile, is two-dimensional in the opposite way: Shes always sweetly supportive.
  Negative
But the character at the center of director and longtime actor  Dexter Fletchers film, Eddie himself, is ironically the least fleshed-out of all.
  Negative
Hes in nearly every single second of the movie, but hes drawn so simplistically, he never feels like an actual human being.
  Negative
Hes all innocence and guilelessness in the script from  Sean Macaulay and  Simon Kelton, and Egerton plays him in a way thats so goofy, the performance becomes off-putting rather than endearing.
  Very negative
Once Eddie sets his sights on ski jumping an event Great Britain hadnt competed in since the s he travels to Germany to train with the worlds greats, whove been tackling this terrifying sport since they were little kids.
  Negative
Hugh Jackman tries to bring some semblance of an edge to these otherwise gooey proceedings as BronsonPeary, the bad-boy American who becomes Eddies reluctant coach.
  Negative
The movie conveys Bronsons rebellious streak through the facile shorthand of showing him constantly smoking and sipping from his flask.
  Negative
Jackman at least adds some much-needed charisma, even when hes saddled with doing cringe-inducing stuff like comparing a ski-jump takeoff to sex with  Bo Derek.
  Positive
But the scene, complete with a When Harry Met Sally -style fake orgasm, only serves as a reminder of how impossibly childlike the -year-old Eddie is by comparison.
  Negative
Anyway, Eddie tries and fails and tries and fails and tries and eventually succeeds enough to secure a spot in the Olympics, where he gains some fame as a sideshow more than anything else.
  Negative
The overly caffeinated press corps bombard him in an unrealistic news conference' along those lines,  Jim Broadbent is entirely overqualified to dole out pat, obvious observations as a British TV commentator.
  Very negative
Fletcher does offer a varied visual approach to Eddies training, though, mixing up camera angles and often trying to create for us the dizzying heights and thrilling sense of flight he experiences.
  Negative
And, toward the end, in a wonderfully bizarre bit of casting, he brings in  Christopher Walken as a legendary coach who literally wrote the book on ski jumping.
  Positive
We actually see the cover of the book, My Life in Ski Jumping, with Walkens unsettlingly serene face on the cover.
  Negative
Now thats the movie Id really like to see.
  Neutral
