  Negative
Co-stars  Diane Keaton and  Morgan Freeman have a breezy, easy chemistry as the aforementioned couple: Ruth and Alex, who decide after  years that its gotten too hard to live in their fifth-floor walkup.
  Negative
But the various other plot threads that weave in and out of this main story tie it up and bog it down.
  Negative
What begins as a sweetly sentimental story ends up being cloyingly melodramatic.
  Positive
Its also as crammed and cluttered as an overpriced New York City studio.
  Negative
The film from director  Richard Loncraine  whose eclectic work runs the gamut from a daring  take on  Richard III to the standard  Harrison Ford actioner  Firewall from   features several subplots, and he segues between them with uneven rhythms.

  Negative
This main story is actually the strongest element of the whole film.
  Positive
The wacky New York types with their lack of an internal censor and their wild ideas for what theyd do to the apartment provide a consistent source of laughs.
  Positive

  Positive
Some of these scene crackle' others are soggy with emotion.
  Negative
As younger versions of these characters, Korey Jackson and Claire van den Boom do an uncanny job of channeling the older actors cadences and mannerisms without resorting to caricature.
  Negative
But wait, theres more.
  Negative
Ruth and Alex also attend open houses at other peoples apartments and keep running into the same potential competitors and lookie-loos.
  Negative
One of them, a ubiquitous little girl played by  Sterling Jerins, is so magical and wise beyond her years that I swear I thought shed turn out to be a ghost or a figment of Alexs imagination.
  Very positive
This leads to some contrived, beat-the-clock scenarios in which they must juggle the various bids on their own apartment while also bidding on other properties.
