The Hundred-Foot Journey is a film that demands that you take it seriously.
  Positive
With its feel-good themes of multicultural understanding, it is about Something Important.
  Positive
It even comes with the stamp of approval from titanic tastemakers  Oprah Winfrey and  Steven Spielberg, who both serve as producers.
  Negative
What more convincing could you possibly need?
  Neutral
Theres something familiar about the treacly and sanctimonious way this film is being packaged.
  Negative
It reeks of late-searly s Miramax fare: films with tasteful yet ubiquitous ad campaigns and unabashed Oscar aspirations which suggested that seeing them and, more importantly, voting for them would make you a better person.
  Positive
Films like The Cider House Rules, Chocolat and The Shipping News.
  Neutral
Films by Swedish director Lasse Hallstrom.
  Neutral
Hallstrom just happens to be the director here, as well, and the similarities to Chocolat are inescapable.
  Negative
Stop me if think youve heard this one before: A family moves into a quaint but closed-minded French village and shakes things up with an enticing array of culinary delicacies.
  Positive
This new enterprise happens to sit across the street from a conservative and revered building thats a town treasure.
  Positive
But the food in question isnt a bon bon this time rather, the movie is the bon bon itself.
  Negative
But despite being handsomely crafted, well acted and even sufficiently enjoyable, The Hundred-Foot Journey is also conventional and predictable.
  Negative
And for a film thats all about opening up your senses and sampling spicy, exotic tastes, this comic drama is entirely too safe and even a little bland.
  Negative
What livens things up, though, is the interplay between Helen Mirren and  Om Puri as battling restaurant owners operating across the street from each other  feet away from each other, to be exact, a short but fraught trip that various characters take for various reasons.
  Negative
Watching these veteran actors stoop to sabotage each other provides a consistent source of laughs.
  Positive
Shes all sharp angles, piercing looks and biting quips' hes all round joviality, boisterous blasts and warmhearted optimism.
  Negative
The contrast between the British Oscar-winner and the Indian acting legend offers the only tension in this otherwise soft and gooey dish that is, until the film goes all soft and gooey, too.
  Negative
Mirren stars as Madame Mallory, owner of Le Saule Pleurer The Weeping Willow, an elegant and expensive French restaurant thats the winner of a prestigious Michelin star.
  Positive
But one star isnt enough for the coldly driven Mme. Mallory she wants another, and then another.
  Negative
But her bloodless quest for gourmet grandeur is interrupted by the arrival across the street of an Indian family: the Kadams, whove been wandering around Europe ever since their beloved restaurant back home burned down during political rioting.
  Negative
When the brakes on their car malfunction on a treacherous stretch of spectacular countryside, Papa Puri insists its a sign from his late wife and decides to open a new eatery in the charming town at the bottom of the hill.
  Negative
Never mind that one of the most celebrated restaurants in all of France is sitting right across the street from the empty building he rents.
  Negative
Never mind that they are in an insular part of the country where the residents probably dont even know what Indian cuisine is, much less like it, as his children point out.
  Negative
He has faith in his food and in his son, Hassan  Manish Dayal, a brilliant, young chef.
  Positive
Just as Papa and Mme. Mallory strike up a sparky rivalry, Hassan enjoys a flirtatious relationship with French sous chef Marguerite  Charlotte Le Bon, who played an early model and muse in the recent Yves Saint Laurent biopic.
  Negative
The script from  Steven Wright who also wrote the far trickier  Locke from earlier this year, as well as  Dirty Pretty Things and  Eastern Promises is full of such tidy parallels, as well as trite and overly simplistic proclamations about how food inspires memories.
  Negative
Dayal and Le Bon do look lovely together, though, and share a light, enjoyable chemistry.
  Very positive
Then  again, it all looks lovely both the French and Indian dishes as well as the lush, rolling surroundings, which we see through  all four seasons' the work of cinematographer  Linus Sandgren, who recently shot  American Hustle.
  Negative
This sweetly pleasing combination of ingredients would have  been perfectly suitable if the film didnt take a wild and needless  detour in the third act.
  Positive
Thats when it becomes an even less interesting movie than it already  was, in spite of its loftier aspirations.
  Negative
