One of the co-founders of the stripped-down Dogme  aesthetic might not sound like the most logical choice to direct  Thomas Hardys classic, sweeping romance  Far From the Madding Crowd.
  Negative
But  Thomas Vinterberg creates a rich aesthetic that combines both vibrant colors and intimate natural light.
  Very positive
Whether his film is lush or rolling in the muck, it always has a tactile quality that makes it accessible, which is also true of the performances from his mostly well-chosen cast.
  Positive
Carey Mulligan is radiant as the fiercely independent Bathsheba Everdene, a literary heroine who remains so vital, she inspired author  Suzanne Collins when she was choosing a last name for the courageous Katniss in the Hunger Games series.
  Positive
Mulligan plays the part quite differently from  Julie Christie, who was luminous but a bit more flirty and playful when she starred as Bathsheba in  John Schlesingers  adaptation of the novel which was a bit of a slog at nearly three hours.
  Negative
Christies Bathsheba used her girlishness and dazzling looks to assert herself in male-dominated Victorian England.
  Negative
Mulligans simply does not care what anyone thinks of her, which makes her even more exciting to watch.
  Negative
Shell seek someones advice, but she probably wont follow it especially when it comes to the complicated love life she never thought she wanted.
  Negative
After strong work in such eclectic films as  An Education which earned her an Oscar nomination,  Drive,  Never Let Me Go and  Inside Llewyn Davis, this might just be the performance of her career.
  Negative
Theres power behind the depth of her voice that provides a fascinating contradiction with her birdlike frame, and a directness to her thats reminiscent of a young  Katharine Hepburn.
  Positive
When Bathsheba tells the staff of the farm shes recently inherited, It is my intention to astonish you all in a bit of a tweak of that famous line from screenwriter  David Nicholls her conviction is clear.
  Positive
Bathshebas path to happiness, however, is far more circuitous.
  Negative
Far From the Madding Crowd is all about the capriciousness of fate, and the way it can drastically alter the trajectory of a young woman who thinks she knows exactly what she wants in a place that's meant to be sedate and safe.
  Neutral
You lose a scarf in the woods, or you show up at the wrong church for a wedding, or you send an impetuous valentine to a near stranger and suddenly, several lives have changed.
  Negative
Cinematographer  Charlotte Bruus Christensen captures the equally variable rural surroundings with breathtaking style, from lens flares on a sunny day and verdant, rolling hills to pinky-purple sunsets and morning streaks of misty light.
  Positive
At the films start, the orphaned but educated Bathsheba is living on a farm with her aunt in  Dorset, about  miles outside London.
  Negative
When we first see her, shes riding exuberantly across the countryside on horseback before leaning backward nimbly to avoid the scrapes of tree branches.
  Negative
Its all so symbolic, this early attempt to emerge unscathed.
  Positive
But the beautiful Bathsheba catches the eye of a nearby sheep farmer, a gentle giant named Gabriel Oak  Matthias Schoenaerts.
  Negative
Her freedom is the very quality about her that appeals to him' he quickly asks her to marry him and is quickly rejected.
  Positive
Schoenaerts, the Belgian star of the Oscar-nominated  Bullhead and the  Marion Cotillard drama Rust and Bone, offers an ideal combination of physicality and sensitivity, and he has strong chemistry with Mulligan from the start.
  Very positive
Gabriel and Bathshebas paths soon cross again, though, when he loses his flock in disastrous fashion and she inherits a farm from her beloved, deceased uncle.
  Negative
Suddenly, shes a landowner and she happens to need a sheepherder.
  Negative
At the same time, she connects sort of with the neighboring landowner, the wealthy and socially awkward bachelor William Boldwood  Michael Sheen, inadvertently enlivening sensations in him he never previously knew.
  Negative
Sheen, the veteran of the cast, prompts great sympathy for this lonely but insistent middle-aged man.
  Positive
If the great  Peter Finch was more of a wild-eyed, creepy stalker in the last incarnation of Far From the Madding Crowd, Sheen makes you want to give him a hug.
  Positive
When Boldwood asks Bathsheba to marry him and, like Gabriel, offers her a piano as part of the deal her response is beautiful but brutal: I have a piano.
  Positive
And I have my own farm.
  Negative
And I have no need for a husband."
  Negative
But then she meets Bachelor No.
  Negative
the arrogant and attractive Sgt. Frank Troy  Tom Sturridge and suddenly, all her proclamations of self-sufficiency go out the window.
  Negative
In tackling the task of adapting Hardys text, Nicholls has abbreviated quite a bit and spelled out some emotions and motivations to expedite matters.
  Positive
Except for a few gaps, this mostly works, and it helps contribute to the films surprisingly brisk, engaging pace.
  Positive
But he was wise to retain the famous scene where Sgt. Troy shows off his swordsmanship in the woods, thrusting at Bathsheba from every possible angle in his regal, red uniform, leaving her breathless.
  Negative
It is not exactly the subtlest form of foreplay, but it is the boldest moment in Sturridges otherwise strangely restrained performance.
  Negative
Terence Stamp was a force of nature in the role opposite Christie' he was confident and charismatic, obviously dangerous and untrustworthy but irresistible all the same.
  Positive
He was a sexy cad, while Sturridge is more of a pouty lad.
  Positive
Its hard to believe this is the man who sweeps the headstrong Bathsheba off her feet.
  Negative
Along those lines, Troys previous relationship with a servant from Bathshebas farm, which is so crucial to understanding his actions, gets short shrift here.
  Negative
Its a casualty of the screenplays cuts and it reduces the presence of the appealing  Juno Temple to glorified-cameo status.
  Positive
Still, Gabriel is clearly the man whos meant for Bathsheba of all the potential suitors pining for her affections.
  Negative
While Boldwood is too prudent and Troy is too much of a party boy, Gabriel obviously represents the middle ground between those extremes.
  Negative
But its not about the destination' rather, its about the shared friendship, respect and trust that create the foundation for a love that was always meant to be.
  Positive
Just try to stop yourself from swooning.
  Negative
