The original  My Big Fat Greek Wedding was a fluke.
  Negative
A charming, warmhearted fluke, but a fluke nonetheless.
  Negative
It was broad and sitcom-y but it resonated with a wide array of moviegoers, despite the peculiarities of its cultural specificity, and it made a mind-boggling  million worldwide in .
  Positive
Fourteen years later , we have a sequel that it seemed nobody in particular was clamoring for, with a title thats as uninspired as the premise itself: My Big Fat Greek Wedding .
  Negative
Yes, there is another big, fat, Greek wedding.
  Negative
Whereas the first film worked mainly through the massive likability of its starwriter,  Nia Vardalos, this sequel which Vardalos also wrote makes the mistake of relegating her to a supporting role in one of way too many interwoven subplots, none of which are particularly compelling.
  Negative
This time, Vardalos sweetly self-deprecating Toula must manage the chaos thats thrust upon her from a multitude of members of her wacky family.
  Negative
In the most contrived of these dilemmas, it turns out that Toulas parents, Chicago restaurant owners Gus  Michael Constantine and Maria  Lainie Kazan, arent actually married after all.
  Negative
The priest back in Greece never signed their marriage certificate  years ago.
  Negative
This means there has to be you guessed it another big, fat, Greek wedding.
  Negative
But wait!
  Positive
Despite constantly harping on every young woman she meets about the importance of getting married, Maria begins to question whether she wants to be someones wife anymore.
  Negative
And yet, we know from the title that this problem will be resolved, so there are no real stakes.
  Negative
At the same time, Toula is having a hard time maintaining the spark with her own husband, Ian  John Corbett, more milquetoast than ever, the WASP-y dude whose arrival in Toulas life created a culture clash in the first film.
  Negative
Shes also devastated at the prospect of her -year-old daughter, Paris  Elena Kampouris, leaving home and heading off to college.
  Negative
Meanwhile, Paris suffers from her own romantic angst as she prepares for prom and tries to deflect the pressure to date a Greek boy.
  Negative
In one particularly embarrassing scene which is emblematic of director  Kirk Jones over-the-top tone throughout Paris entire family shows up at her schools college fair to ensure that she stays in town and goes to Northwestern.
  Positive
They bring homemade spanakopita.
  Neutral
They pressure the admissions representative.
  Negative
They mug wildly for group photographs.
  Neutral
Over and over again, this is the level of humor in My Big Fat Greek Wedding  this is the shrill note it hits.
  Negative
It isnt enough to show that Toulas family is supposedly lovably embarrassing.
  Negative
Gags get piled upon gags with relentless frenzy and results that are overbearing rather than uproarious.
  Negative
You can rely on every character to behave exactly the same way every time, regardless of the situation, and that way is usually obnoxious.
  Negative
Even a character who comes out as gay which, in theory, should be an important moment arrives out of nowhere and carries zero emotional heft.
  Negative
And then every once in a while,  John Stamos and  Rita Wilson a producer on the film once again show up as husband and wife, ostensibly because theyre Greek and theyre doing due diligence.
  Negative
The one figure we can rely on to shake things up through the sheer awesomeness of her bizarre presence is Second City veteran  Andrea Martin as Toulas thoroughly inappropriate Aunt Voula.
  Negative
Just the choices in her facial expressions and vocal intonations are good for consistent laughs.
  Positive
And man, for those few moments, does it feel good to laugh.
  Positive
Vardalos choices both on screen and behind the scenes arent quite so easy to figure out.
  Positive
Ordinarily blessed with a pleasing accessibility and quick wit, here Vardalos has stripped this character she created of everything that made her endearing and turned her into a skittish, wound-up ball of codependency.
  Positive
Toula is a wife and a mother but more often behaves like a scared little girl as she spinelessly agrees to every whim and demand from her selfish, needy family.
  Negative
Her script is a mess, and no amount of Windex can clean it up.
  Very negative
