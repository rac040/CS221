Watching Manolo: The Boy Who Made Shoes for Lizards is akin to skimming a celebrity-saturated Instagram page.
  Negative
There are plentiful pretty faces and objects on display, but nary a trace of substance in the captions and no link in the bio.
  Negative
The best thing about the picture is the title, which suggests a more imaginative and revealing profile of its titular subject, a man widely deemed as the worlds greatest living shoemaker.
  Very positive
I went into the screening knowing virtually nothing about Manolo Blahnik, and left knowing next-to-nothing.
  Negative
First-time director  Michael Roberts assembles a high-profile crowd of acquaintances and admirers some of whom only materialize via voice-over and has them drone on and on about what a legend Blahnik is.
  Positive
Perhaps die-hard fashionistas would find this reasonably diverting, but to everyone else, it is guaranteed to grow tiresome very quickly.
  Negative
Lets start with the lizards custom-fitted shoes, since the film does as well.
  Positive
We hear Blahnik reminisce about crafting tiny footwear for the critters while growing up in Santa Cruz.
  Negative
This is depicted in black-and-white recreations, and then the sequence ends, registering as little more than an attention-grabbing prologue.
  Negative
What compelled him to make shoes for the lizards and what significance does this have to his legacy in general, apart from being a quirky diversion?
  Negative
Its not long before we realize that the film is interested solely in such diversions, while tap-dancing around the complexities of Blahnik himself.
  Negative
Only in its final third does the movie offer some glimmers of dimension, as the designer touches upon how he never sought out a relationship, has a severe case of germophobia and annually attempts to forget his birthday.
  Negative
He has no political beliefs or life partners to speak of, and though sex clearly fuels his imagination, he doesnt consider himself a sexual being.
  Negative
Since Blahnik finds fulfillment first and foremost through the act of artistic creation, the film shouldve delved into the particulars of his process, but it never strays from its surface-level perspective.
  Negative
For all the blathering that takes place onscreen, the film is awfully inarticulate when it comes to its own topic.
  Negative
We dont even learn the names of Blahniks signature shoe designs until theyre rattled off on title cards toward the end.
  Negative
Left unexplained are the reasons for why and how the designers shoes are so comfortable, earning him a devoted global fan base that includes Rihanna and Vogue editor  Anna Wintour.
  Negative
Instead, the audience is treated to the cinematic equivalent of a slapped-together PowerPoint presentation, as Roberts lists the bullet points of Blahniks past without bothering to connect them.
  Negative
Here are a collection of newspaper headlines detailing his rise to the top.
  Positive
Here are three fashion icons he knew who have died.
  Negative
Heres footage from the designers favorite movie,  Luchino Viscontis  The Leopard.
  Positive
Golly gee, Princess Diana is wearing a pair of Manolo stilettos!
  Negative
And isnt that  Donald Trump among the crowd at one of Blahniks shows?
  Negative
Its easy to get distracted by the little details when the films narrative is utterly devoid of conflict.
  Negative
Roberts breezes over Blahniks childhood, portraying it as a big happy bore, without detailing the influence of his mother not to mention a trunkful of Pietro Yanturni shoes on the mans work.
  Negative
Even when fashion became schizophrenic in the s, Blahniks popularity was resilient, as illustrated by a clip from  Sex and the City, where Carries Manolos are stolen at gunpoint.
  Negative
When the film pauses long enough to offer nuggets of insight, they are often inconsistent.
  Negative
Blahniks longtime friend,  Rupert Everett, quips that the designers shoes for men are actually more feminine versions of his womens shoes, but later praises the dominating masculinity of certain designs, comparing them to a giant phallus.
  Negative
Blahnik is renowned for his warm disposition while dealing with customers, yet model Penelope Tree recalls how he chastised her for having the feet of a peasant.
  Positive
Though the film seems to find its banter between Blahnik and his fawning admirers amusing, I only remember laughing once during the picture.
  Positive
During his first big collection show in the early s, Blahnik had forgotten to insert steel into the rubber high heels worn by his models, causing them to stumble lopsidedly down the runway.
  Negative
The disastrous footage is quite enjoyable in part because of the models good-natured spirit, cavorting in the spotlight rather than sulking away in shame.
  Positive
Their refusal to take themselves seriously certainly mirrors that of Blahnik, whose penchant for mugging is charming at first, yet also prevents him from having an unguarded moment on camera.
  Positive
The deeper problem is the directors tendency to punctuate nearly every scene with a flippant tone, even when the subject matter is no laughing matter.
  Negative
In an audio interview,  Sofia Coppola reflects on how her exuberantly unconventional  period piece,  Marie Antoinette, dressed the th century queen in Manolo shoes, allowing the Oscar-winning costume designs of Milena Canonero to be as modern as the post-punk soundtrack.
  Negative
Coppola viewed Antoinette as a trophy wife resigned to losing herself in shopping as a method to avoid her loveless marriage.
  Negative
The poignance of this observation, hinting at a deeper reason for why people make extravagant purchases, is instantly upended once a cartoon of Antoinettes decapitated head bounces comically off the screen.
  Negative
All one has to do is glance at the fetishistic close-ups of Blahniks shoes to know that theres bound to be an interesting film that could be made about his life.
  Positive
A childlike playfulness exudes from every curlicue and plume of color adorning his designs.
  Negative
Its easy to see how he was influenced by the photography of Cecil Beaton in how it fused disparate elements in visionary ways.
  Positive
How unfortunate that this picture spends most its time, to paraphrase Beaton, cooing like a bloody dove at its own subject.
  Negative
Roberts appears less interested in exploring Blahniks life than in being him.
  Neutral
The overbearing score utilizes Tchiakovskys immortal Sugarplum Fairy theme not once but twice in order to illustrate the designers sprite-like nature, as he frolics from one subject to the next with unerring glee.
  Negative
Alas, the film follows in its subjects footsteps to a fault, and it does so in rubber heels.
