Charlie Siskels American Anarchist is an intriguing film about an infuriating man.
  Positive
Like  Errol Morris  The Fog of War, the documentary centers on an individual who essentially launched a weapon of mass destruction and had to live with the consequences.
  Negative
Yet whereas The Fog of Wars subject, former Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara, was candid and eloquent, staring the viewer straight in the face thanks to Morris Interrotron, the eyes of Siskels interviewee are averted toward his interrogator with more than a glint of reluctance.
  Negative
William Powell is not at all what one would expect the author of s  The Anarchists Cookbook  to look or sound like at age .
  Negative
He speaks in a British accent, spawned from his childhood in England, and looks more like a seasoned professor than an aging hippie.
  Positive
When Siskel starts asking him questions about the notorious book he wrote when he was , Powell appears as baffled as the audience by the fact he had anything to do with it.
  Negative
His answers arent evasive so much as they are muddled, considering he partakes in more hemming and hawing than a marathon of  Warren Beatty performances.
  Negative
As a former field producer on  Michael Moores  Bowling for Columbine, which is briefly glimpsed here, Siskel shares his mentors desire of catching his subject in a moment of self-revelation, guiding him toward it by illuminating the blind spots in his perspective.
  Negative
This creates a testy dynamic between him and Powell, causing the man at one point to scold the director for being deliberately provocative.
  Positive
Of course, the same could be said of Powells book, which compiles various diagrams and recipes culled by the author from military manuals, with section titles such as How To Make Tear Gas In Your Basement and Railroad Sabotage.
  Negative
Siskel grounds the films early scenes in the historical backdrop of Powells youth, a time when the Vietnam war had led countless citizens to believe that their government was out of control.
  Negative
The parallels between then and now are frighteningly apparent, with the fierce spirit of that eras protesters embodied in the Black Lives Matter movement, so well-documented in Sabaah Folayan and Damon Davis Whose Streets?
  Negative
Burning down convenience stores after police fail to be punished for killing unarmed black youth is deemed by members of the movement as a strategic revolutionary act, with the key factor being that the private property is unoccupied at the time of its destruction.
  Negative
The message advocated in Powells book is much more troubling, as articulated in lines like People are helpless without a gun and Respect must be earned by the spilling of blood.
  Negative
After Powell claims that he hasnt read the book since he wrote it, Siskel hands him a copy and asks him to recite selected passages, including the above lines that the author now believes to be rubbish.
  Negative
Though the word anarchist is included in the books title, Powell stresses that he wrote every page entirely on his own, without being under the influence of any particular movement.
  Negative
He felt that since the military and various radical groups already knew these destructive tactics, the general public had a right to that knowledge as well, citing Lincolns belief that the American people have the right to overthrow their own government.
  Positive
The tragic flaw in Powells conviction is the fact that it places far too much trust in people.
  Negative
We see a montage of YouTube clips with kids using the books recipes to nearly blow themselves up in what could be regarded as Americas Dumbest Home Videos.
  Negative
The Anarchists Cookbook is nothing more than the product of an idealistic mind that mistakenly believed the public would embrace its instructions as a tool to fight against evil, rather than be used by those who, like  Heath Ledgers Joker and the characters real-life doppelgnger in Colorado, just want to watch the world burn.
  Negative
Powell, who passed away a year after filming on this project began, spent the last three-and-a-half decades of his life in self-imposed ignorance of the catastrophic effect his book had on generations of Americans, having lived entirely abroad with his wife, Ochan.
  Negative
Siskel unleashes a string of statistics to illustrate how the books righteous call for bloodshed has empowered everyone from homicidal teenagers and abortion clinic bombers to member of ISIS, all fueled by the shared belief that society has forgotten them.
  Negative
The copies of his book found in the houses of these terrorists leaves Powell filled with remorse, which he notes is different from regret.
  Negative
Ochan is more forthright in her thoughts: We all do dumb things, but not all of us put it into print.
  Negative
The grand irony of Powells life is that he went on to spend the majority of his adulthood as an educator devoted to helping children who, like himself, have emotional problems.
  Negative
His move to and from Britain as a kid caused him to feel like a perpetual outsider, building up a frustration that resulted in Powell committing acts that, as an adult, he conspicuously underplays, such as how he gently pushed a teachers car into a tree.
  Negative
Siskel waits until the films last moments to reveal that Powell had been fondled by a teacher in boarding school, a horrific episode that, if anything, suggests why he felt the driving need to arm those who feel powerless.
  Negative
Lyle Stuart, the books publisher, comes across as a sensationalistic hack in Powells stories, allegedly staging a smoke bombing raid at the authors press conference.
  Very negative
After Stuart bought the rights for ,, Powell moved on with his life, and has been attempting to escape his past ever since.
  Positive
On numerous occasions, an anonymous group would unearth the book to prevent him from getting hired at various schools.
  Negative
Finally, Powell decided to put a statement on Amazon.com in which he denounced the book, and thirteen years later, published an op-ed piece at The Guardian where he expressed the same feelings.
  Neutral
These acts, while well-intentioned, underline how Powell did the absolute bare minimum to prevent his book from being in print.
  Negative
After California senator Dianne Feinstein spoke out against the book, Powell reached out to her via e-mail, but the out of office message he received back discouraged him from pursuing the matter any further.
  Negative
American Anarchist presents us with a young man who believed he was living in the apocalypse, and whose book has gone on to have an apocalyptic effect on society.
  Neutral
Powell should be commended for his efforts to do good later in life, but his refusal to clean up the mess from his youth is puzzling and maddening in the extreme.
  Negative
His decision to leave the U.S. is sort of like Shanes decision to leave the farmhouse in  George Stevens classic western, had Shane chosen to leave all his guns in the valley.
  Negative
