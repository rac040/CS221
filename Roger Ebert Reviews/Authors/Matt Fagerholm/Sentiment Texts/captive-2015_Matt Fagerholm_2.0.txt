Jerry Jamesons Captive is a work of surprising restraint.
  Positive
Its agenda is clear from the get-go, and will undoubtedly attract the same audiences that flocked to this years other releases targeting an Evangelical Christian demographic.
  Negative
Yet the message here is delivered in such a subdued way that it could easily register as an afterthought for many viewers.
  Negative
For a film supposedly about the transformative power of faith, Captive has very little to preach in that regard, apart from the importance of purchasing megachurch pastor Rick Warrens hit book, The Purpose Driven Life.
  Negative
This is the book that recovering meth addict  Ashley Smith read to Brian Nichols, the fugitive who held her hostage in her apartment in .
  Negative
Arrested on charges of rape, kidnapping and assault of his longtime girlfriend, Nichols had shot his way out of a courtroom, killing three people and severely injuring a fourth.
  Negative
The reawakening of his conscience while in the presence of Smith is deemed by Jameson as the result of listening to Warrens words, yet the film skims through them so swiftly, it seems to assume that weve already read the book.
  Negative
We never get a real sense of precisely how Warren left an impact on Nichols, aside from allegedly motivating him to do the right thing.
  Negative
It all feels too pat and tidy, and therefore registers as less than convincing.
  Negative
Still, the film couldve been so much worse.
  Negative
Captive could have utilized patronizing tropes, with its white heroine redeeming a gun-wielding black man.
  Negative
It is largely to the credit of actors  Kate Mara and  David Oyelowo that their characters resonate as more textured than they may have seemed on the page.
  Negative
Oyelowo plays Nichols with such a flat affect that he truly appears to have convinced himself of his innocence.
  Negative
He is deranged, to be sure, but the actor doesnt indulge in scenery-chewing.
  Neutral
Nichols merely comes off as a man whose pervasive denial has caused his eyes to become clouded by the haze of misguided righteousness.
  Negative
Mara is equally strong as a mother struggling to better herself for the sake of her young daughter.
  Neutral
She has her own demons to contend with, and is every bit as reluctant to embrace Warrens words at first glance.
  Neutral
The films most touching scenes occur when Mara and Oyelowo let their respective guards down and begin to open up about their lives.
  Positive
Even when their character motivations are murky at best, the actors uphold our suspension of disbelief more often than one would expect.
  Negative
It also helps that the -year-old Jameson has the skills of a veteran storyteller.
  Positive
He served as an editorial supervisor on The  Andy Griffith Show and directed Airport , not to mention several episodes of Walker Texas Ranger.
  Negative
This is his first theatrical release in  years, and it looks and feels like an actual movie, not a church-funded PSA stretched to feature-length.
  Negative
The problem, alas, is that Mara and Oyelowo are ultimately captive in a script that doesnt allow its characters to stretch outside their preordained boundaries.
  Very negative
The Purpose Driven Life is always lurking on the periphery, awaiting its role as the Clarence-like angel bestowing wisdom at the precise moment the characters need it most.
  Negative
Warrens message, as succinctly conveyed in the film, is that life without purpose is meaningless, and that one must find purpose through Christ.
  Very negative
Its possible to view the moral of Captive as no different from the moral of The Book of Mormon.
  Negative
If religion inspires people to commit acts of goodness, then it serves as a positive force in society, regardless of its authenticity.
  Positive
Perhaps the film shies away from delving too deeply into Warrens ideology because it wants to avoid any trace of controversy.
  Negative
During one of his candid confessions to Smith, Nichols admits that he felt good while gunning down his victims.
  Negative
His sin was allowing his primal instincts to take over, which is a subject Warren has spoken about at great length.
  Negative
In a   interview with Piers Morgan, Warren likened homosexuality to adultery and assault, labeling all of them as acts that occur after one gives into their natural impulses.
  Negative
Just because I have a feeling doesnt make it right, Warren said.
  Negative
Not everything natural is good for me.
  Neutral
Arsenic is natural.
  Positive
Its hard to criticize a film like Captive for its anti-murder stance, yet it is the anti-gay beliefs of Warren that will prevent countless people from picking up his book, even after theyve been held hostage.
  Very negative
