Its not all that uncommon for young lovers to feel as if theyve known each other before.
  Negative
The hormonal euphoria overtaking their bodies may be new to them, but its also as old as the species itself.
  Negative
No wonder why a first kiss can suddenly feel so natural.
  Negative
The body knows what to do even as the mind reels.
  Positive
Scott Hicks Fallen begins with this germ of truth, as it regards two smitten teenagers who feel inexplicably drawn to one another.
  Positive
Yet like many would-be YA franchises, Fallen fuses its one good idea with countless bad ones generated not from life experience but from recycled formulas.
  Negative
Based on the book by  Lauren Kate, this picture aspires to be the  Divergent to Twilights Hunger Games, borrowing practically all of its archetypal characters from Stephenie Meyer's hit series while placing them in a reform school that might as well be named Hogwarts Asylum of Mist and Misery.
  Negative
After enticing the audience with an exquisitely animated prologue detailing the plight of fallen angels shunned for choosing love over duty, the film becomes laughable as soon as it cuts to live action.
  Negative
Arriving at the aforementioned school is Bella er, Lucinda  Addison Timlin, a troubled teen fresh out of therapy after supposedly killing one of her male peers.
  Negative
She has no memory of what happened, aside from the events that frequently materialize in rapid bursts of flashbacks.
  Negative
Clearly some sinister force is responsible for the murder, and even viewers entirely unfamiliar with this genre will be able to guess where that force emanates from long before its revealed.
  Negative
Rather than accompany Lucinda as she gets acquainted with her new home, her parents simply drop her off, leaving the girl to enter the spooky old building by herself.
  Negative
Shes soon greeted by stern disciplinarian Randy  David Schaal, who recites various rules and regulations with all the owl-eyed awkwardness of a  Rainn Wilson android.
  Negative
Then a moody guy in handcuffs, Cam  Harrison Gilbertson, sticks a sucker in his mouth and struts past Lucinda, instantly causing her to audibly quiver.
  Negative
Is this her future emo dreamboat patterned after a certain Pattinson?
  Neutral
Nope, turns out the author has opted for the more Lautner-like corner of the Meyer-esque love triangle, complete with the sculpted abs in this case, Daniel  Jeremy Irvine.
  Negative
But whereas Cams openly compassionate personality is more akin to that of  Taylor Lautners Jacob, Daniel is as unfriendly and evasive as  Robert Pattinsons Edward.
  Negative
Naturally, Lucinda chooses Daniel because, alas, she channels all the familiar traits of Meyer's horrendous heroine, Bella Swan.
  Negative
She has no personal goals or aspirations to speak of, since her future is defined entirely by the centuries-old man in her life blessed with ageless youth.
  Negative
The main difference is that Daniel is not a vampire, but a you guessed it fallen angel.
  Negative
In fact, the schools entire group of oddball outcasts is comprised of them, including the exceedingly unpleasant Molly Sianoa Smith-McPhee, sister of Kodi.
  Negative
Working in the same unimaginative vein he did while helming s  The Lucky One, Hicks doesnt even bother to build any semblance of suspense around the notion that all these celestial visions might be spawned from Lucindas damaged psyche.
  Very negative
When Molly travels great distances in record time while bullying Lucinda in a hallway, theres no doubt that the winged vixen is flapping in our heroines direction.
  Negative
Since wings may be deemed less cool than fangs among the target demographic, the filmmakers decide to visualize the feathered appendages as CGI outlines that crackle like discount lightsabers.
  Negative
Regardless of how cheap the wings look, the flying sequences are so poorly executed that we never for a moment believe that anyone is lifting off the ground.
  Negative
We also dont buy the alleged spark between Lucinda and Daniel, who avoids her like the plague until shes nearly crushed by a statue.
  Negative
Then he swoops to the rescue just like Edward did to prevent Bella from getting crushed by a car.
  Neutral
Only this time, he lands on top of her, and does so again after an emotionally charged bout of fencing.
  Positive
Memo to the school: fencing may not be the best activity for potentially homicidal teenagers.
  Negative
A strain of religious extremism championed by Professor Sophia  Joely Richardson is blamed for forcing Daniel to deny his true feelings, though just as the Twilight saga was essentially a metaphor for abstinence, Fallen shies away from any overt traces of eroticism.
  Very negative
It even lacks the trashy fun of the Twilight pictures, which knew that its audience was primarily interested in ogling the half-naked male bodies onscreen.
  Negative
Here, Lucinda is less interested in Daniels chiseled pecs than in whatever generic clue happens to be dangling between them.
  Negative
Timlins performance isnt bad, per se, but it sure made me yearn for  Kristen Stewarts unfairly mocked portrayal of Bella, which captured her characters infuriating neediness with a textured authenticity.
  Very negative
At first, Timlins understated line delivery seems almost refreshing, until you realize that every single one of her lines will be delivered in the same lilting, dreamlike tone.
  Positive
Its not long before the performance verges into monotony and then self-parody, as if Timlin were satirizing  Rooney Mara on an SNL sketch.
  Negative
The only person who appears to be having any fun here at all is  Lola Kirke, an actress who is quickly gaining a reputation as the  Lili Taylor of her generation.
  Negative
Stuck with the thankless task of portraying Penn, Lucindas nerdy sidekick, Kirke easily walks away with the picture.
  Positive
The fact that she can rattle off her clunky dialogue with such ease and even earn a couple giggles in the process is a testament to how fabulous a performer she is.
  Positive
Consider the following cringe-inducing exchange: Is it wrong that I kind of hate her?
  Negative
Lucinda asks Penn, while glaring at nearby mean girl.
  Negative
Why?
  Negative
Penn asks, Cause shes a honey-scented, spray-tanned, bikini-waxed, manicured blonde femmebot whos always smiling and is at this very moment kissing your crush?
  Negative
Its the sort of line no actor should be sentenced with, but Kirke somehow pulls it off.
  Negative
And when her boyfriend bites the dust, her wrenching reaction puts all the half-hearted emoting from her co-stars to shame.
  Negative
With Kirke poised for stardom, its only appropriate that Penn bit the dust too, thus saving her from having to deliver more sitcom quips in future installments.
  Negative
Like the franchises it so dearly hopes to compete with, Fallen doesnt end so much as stop with a thud, assuming that well all be on pins and needles for Part II.
  Negative
Sadly, just as Penn was diagnosed with untreatable TDP Tragically Disinterested Parents Fallen will undoubtedly succumb to TDA Tragically Disinterested Audience.
  Very negative
