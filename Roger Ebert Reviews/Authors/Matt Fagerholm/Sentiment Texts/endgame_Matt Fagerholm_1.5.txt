Theres a temptation when faced with a film like Endgame to give it a pass as harmless family entertainment.
  Positive
It has its heart in the right place and is eager to please.
  Very positive
The real-life triumph of the disenfranchised public school students from Brownsville, Texas, who became chess champions is inarguably inspiring.
  Positive
Their story is certainly worthy of being told, but director  Carmen Marron has greater ambitions.
  Positive
She also wants to tackle damaged family bonds, teenage death and the tragedy of deportation faced by illegal immigrants.
  Negative
Endgame tries to be about many important issues, and ends up doing none of them justice.
  Negative
Thats a shame, considering how the film couldve been a refreshing dramatic showcase for sitcom star  Rico Rodriguez.
  Negative
Hes a young man of ample girth who wears glasses a prime target for bullying at his age yet he never utilizes his appearance to acquire cheap laughs.
  Negative
He looks like any other normal kid, struggling to find his place in the world while grappling with the ever-present nuisance of puberty.
  Negative
The fact that his words dont ring true in Endgame may have less to do with his seven seasons on Modern Family and more to do with the script by Marron and  Hector Salinas, which appears to have been stitched together entirely from recycled fragments of Afterschool Specials.
  Negative
This is the sort of film where a teacher gives an inspirational pep talk to a student while standing in front a sign that reads, INSPIRE.
  Negative
The fictional narrative contrived here isnt a fleshed-out story so much as a list of bullet points.
  Negative
None of the emotional payoffs are earned because nothing is adequately developed.
  Negative
We see young Jose Rodriguez excelling at chess while under the tutelage of his grandmother  Ivonne Coll and devoted coach  Efren Ramirez, yet we get no real sense of his technique.
  Negative
There are numerous overhead shots of pieces being shifted and checkmates being declared, but little context as to how the game actually works.
  Positive
A scene where the teacher instructs students to practice on a life-sized chess board is no help, since its more concerned with the mugging cuteness of the kids dance moves.
  Negative
Similarly, the audience is never allowed to share in Joses grieving process after his older brother, a celebrated star of the school soccer team, dies in a car accident that plays like a self-contained anti-drug ad.
  Negative
Any trace of the boy's despair is left offscreen, leaving his mother, Karla  Justina Machado, with the unenviable task of supplying the otherwise absent emotion, all the while being thoroughly unlikable.
  Negative
Theres no question that the older brother was Karlas favorite, and with him gone, she focuses solely on her own suffering, while treating Jose with cold indifference.
  Very negative
A few of her lines would make even  Mary Tyler Moores icy matriarch in  Ordinary People shudder.
  Negative
When a beloved companion of Joses is snatched by border patrol officers, Karla cant muster any words of consolation apart from, Well, Im sure youll make other friends.
  Negative
The deportation subplot comes completely out of left field and is so whiplash-inducing in its haphazard placement that it elicits incredulity rather than empathy.
  Negative
You can practically hear the soap opera clang on the soundtrack as this twist is revealed, only to be swiftly abandoned long before the final act.
  Negative
Marron does a disservice to this monumentally topical issue by treating it like an arbitrary plot point.
  Negative
The same could be said about Karlas inner demons, which she finally reveals in the films only instance of raw feeling.
  Neutral
She lashes out at her mother for being distant throughout her childhood, choosing to focus on chess tournaments rather than her maternal duties, and then accuses the blindsided woman of using chess to place a wall between her and Jose.
  Positive
Its an effective scene, but it establishes a dynamic that is never developed beyond the stage of a first draft.
  Positive
How do the mother and daughter make amends prior to the happy ending?
  Neutral
You wont find out by watching the movie.
  Negative
Another germ of a good idea emerges in scenes involving the chess coach played by Ramirez, formerly Pedro of  Napoleon Dynamite, who fares the best of anyone else in the cast.
  Negative
Hes barely making ends meet, yet still is bound and determined to guide his students toward what he hopes will be a successful adulthood.
  Neutral
Hes also a vulnerable human himself, and is barely able to conceal his desperation as the kids motivation starts to wane.
  Positive
Would I be investing my rent money in you if I didnt think you could do it?
  Negative
he exclaims while straining to smile.
  Neutral
So come on, dont make me homeless!
  Negative
Its a funny line, even if its essentially an expository one.
  Positive
Anytime this impoverished teacher materialized onscreen, I thought to myself, Now theres the movie.
  Positive
