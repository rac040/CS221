Dying is easy, comedy is hard.
  Negative
Its easy to see why people like Ebert would be so taken with the droll charm of New Yorker cartoons, which essentially serve as cultural criticism.
  Negative
They can accentuate the absurdities of everyday life with sketches that are at once spare and expressive, silly and sophisticated.
  Positive
Theres no doubt that most critics who watch  Leah Wolchoks playful documentary, Very Semi-Serious, will find the array of cartoonists interviewed eminently relatable, in part because their cherished work will never pay the bills, thus rendering day jobs a necessity.

Theres a particularly poignant cartoon where a boss matter-of-factly informs his employee that, We have a new financial model where you dont get paid anything.
  Negative
Catnip for writers and humorists of all stripes, Wolchoks film provides delightful breakdowns of various cartoons, examining the comedic rhythm of their design and detail.

Occasionally the camera will pan down an elaborate drawing before lingering on a succinct caption of deadpan understatement.
  Negative
Unlike  Wordplay,  Patrick Creadons  profile of New York Times crossword puzzle editor Will Shortz, Very Semi-Serious is not limited to the story of one man and his many admirers.
  Negative
At a brisk  minutes, the film does live up to its tongue-in-cheek subtitle promising a partially thorough portrait of New Yorker cartoonists, though Wolchok does an admirable job of providing amble screen time for numerous artists both veteran and aspiring while enabling us to survey their distinctive styles the most iconic of which belongs to Gothic satirist Charles Addams.

The same cannot be said of Liana Finck, another fresh-faced, soft-spoken talent whose submissions rely heavily on her own handwritten captions.

At the center of the film, of course, is Mankoff, who resembles a grayer yet cheerier  Joel Coen, and is credited with keeping his department relevant after taking over as cartoon editor in .
  Negative
It was his idea to make the cartoons intergenerational by giving young people the chance to contribute their work, which tends to be inspired more by Ren and Stimpy than Goofus and Gallant Mankoff asks one artist to dial back on the seemingly crack-fueled expressions of his characters.
  Negative
The emergence of female voices has also been key in subverting the publications predominantly male gaze.
  Negative
In an excerpt of archival footage, the head of twentysomething cartoonist Roz Chast is seen bobbing its way through a sea of men at a staff party, an indelible image worthy of its own caption.
  Negative
Chast has since become one of The New Yorkers most prolific cartoonists, with taboo-busting peers like Emily Flake following in her footsteps.

Flake considers the bullying and alienation she endured in her youth not only preparation for her career as a cartoonist, but a pre-requisite.
  Neutral
Nothing provides better fodder for comedy than the unescapable seriousness of life.

  Negative
My guess is that it wont at all, considering editor David Remnicks response to a colleague cautioning that a cartoon parodying The Last Supper will receive hate mail: Who cares?
  Negative
Though the subjects remain acutely aware of Wolchoks camera throughout, there is one instance of unguarded emotion where Mankoff and his wife recall the recent death of their son.

Tears begin to flow as they explain that their recent change of houses was motivated by their need to escape painful memories that existed in every signifier of the past.
  Negative
For nearly a century, The New Yorker cartoons have provided readers with the sort of visual diversions that have made it possible for life to continue to be lived, even in the wake of unthinkable despair.
  Negative
We seek solace in them, and so do their creators.
  Negative
In one classic cartoon, a man is guided out of his bedroom by the Grim Reaper, while his wife calmly replies, Think of it as one less thing to worry about.
