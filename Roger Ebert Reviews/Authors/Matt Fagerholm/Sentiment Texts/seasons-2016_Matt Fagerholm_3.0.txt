Just looking at the incredible movement of a lizard or a bird, or even the smallest insect, can be a very humbling experience.
  Negative
Jim Henson    There is a space beneath a small outdoor balcony at my parents house that birds have annually used to build a nest.
  Negative
For many years, the same nest has been painstakingly remodeled by various birds eager to find a safe place for their babies to hatch.
  Negative
Anytime I venture into the backyard during the spring, the mother bird will wait patiently on a nearby fence or tree until Ive left.
  Negative
Then Ill often race to the window supplying a perfect view of the bird as she swoops back to the nest, ready to feed the ravenous gaping mouths of her chirping offspring.
  Neutral
Observing our primal needs and connection with one another mirrored by our fellow creatures on this planet never ceases to amaze and humble me.
  Positive
Of course, that makes me an ideal audience member for Seasons, the third installment of  Jacques Perrin and  Jacques Cluzauds trilogy of nature documentaries that began with s Oscar-nominated  Winged Migration and continued with s Oceans.
  Positive
Perrin is a giant of the French film industry, having also earned an Oscar nomination for co-producing  Costa-Gavras  Z, while being widely known for playing the adult Toto in  Cinema Paradiso.
  Positive
His soothing narration is used sparingly in Seasons, a wise decision that allows for long stretches in which the viewer becomes fully immersed within the wordless world of the animals habitat.
  Positive
As proven by another of this years notable French productions, Michael Dudok de Wits haunting animated fantasy, The Red Turtle, the naturalistic movement of characters both human and animal can convey a story more eloquently than dialogue ever could.
  Positive
Whenever Perrins voice reemerges, it marks not only the shifts in seasons, but in eras.
  Negative
Though it is billed as a documentary, this film is more of a hybrid combining the expected footage of various species with staged scenarios featuring actors.
  Negative
We begin with blinding blizzards representing the ice age, where animals sported the same stubborn resilience they have later demonstrated in the face of potential extinction.
  Negative
The first hour is primarily devoted to recreating the golden age of the forest, where animals move freely amidst the dense wilderness without fear of invading humans.
  Negative
There is a plentiful awww factor here, with little deers making their first steps and baby wolves roughhousing with playful abandon, but this is not at all a Disneyfied view of nature.
  Very negative
Gone are the contrived narratives used to hold the attention of family audiences, though the lack of contextualization can occasionally work against the picture.
  Negative
Nothing in Seasons is quite as memorable as the best moments of BBCs Planet Earth and Life programs, the latter of which included a Vogelkop bowerbird that built an elaborate decorative sanctuary in order to attract females.
  Positive
In contrast, Perrin and Cluzauds film can grow rather repetitive, with the interactions between creatures being continuously limited to the predatorprey dynamic.
  Negative
Still, there are numerous thrilling sights to behold, such as a thunderous fight between horses and a majestic sequence of flying squirrels soaring across the trees at night.
  Positive
What the filmmakers are especially adept at is replicating the visceral sensations experienced by the animals, such as the swaying of a tree inhabited by critters as it creaks and quivers in the wind.
  Negative
As awe-inspiring as this footage is, its every bit as amazing to envision how the filmmakers had to prepare for framing these moments with impeccable precision.
  Very positive
A documentary about the making of a nature documentary would be hugely entertaining, as illustrated by the outtakes at the end of  March of the Penguins, showing camera operators lugging cumbersome equipment through the frozen tundra.
  Negative
At many points during Seasons, I found myself wondering, Just how, for example, does a cameraman know where to be positioned in order to capture the image of baby birds getting nudged out of their nest perched high in a tree?
  Negative
Theres a camera placed at ground level that films a bird as it hurtles toward the ground, falling just to the left of the lens.
  Negative
Equally mind-boggling is the footage of a wild boar being chased by a pack of wolves, which are followed every step of the way by the camera.
  Negative
Ill confess I was less concerned with the boar than I was with the camera slamming into the inevitable tree.
  Negative
Not only do we once again get those staggering birds-eye view shots seen throughout Winged Migration, we also get to follow the birds reflections as they caress the surface of the water while in flight.
  Negative
Topping that is a flying insects point of view that frankly seems impossible to have been achieved without the use of visual effects.
  Negative
I felt like applauding the title card in the end credits reassuring us that no animals were harmed in the making of the film, considering how many are eaten or shot on camera in very convincing fashion.
  Negative
Existing just on the periphery of every shot is the world of man, which is hinted at fleetingly by the occasional arrow or lone figure until the final third, when the humans finally take over along with Perrin and Cluzauds overarching environmental agenda no different from the one in Oceans.
  Negative
Some viewers will complain that the narration becomes too preachy, but I found it downright chilling, in light of how the seasons have recently become so distorted that the promise of a white Christmas is no longer a given.
  Positive
Perrin argues that humans have modified the climate to a perilous extent and have drained the planet of finite resources, though he believes that we actually possess the ability to repair much of what we have broken.
  Negative
As I watched hunter-gatherers stripping forests of layer upon layer, I was reminded of how the CBS Sunday Morning nature segments have gradually been pared down into such small soundbites that they are no longer capable of truly transporting viewers.
  Negative
Humans, alas, have emerged as the ultimate predators, and in Seasons, they remain appropriately faceless except for the child who dares to look nature in the eye.
  Negative
