The footage of actual play rehearsals is much smaller than one would expect, and it wouldve been more effective to show the kids having their own epiphany about the shows metaphorical subject matter the world in disarray, the rebuilding of Athens, rather than having their teachers spell it out for the viewer.
  Negative
Kramers background in TV movies, including the Mitch Albom adaptations, The Five People You Meet in Heaven and For One More Day, inform his straightforward yet tender approach to portraying the spirituality of his subjects.
