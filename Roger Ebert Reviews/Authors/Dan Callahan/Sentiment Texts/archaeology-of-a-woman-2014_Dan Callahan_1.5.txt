Sally Kirkland has almost  credits on her IMDb page, and one of them is Archaeology of a Woman, which was made in  but is only now getting a week-long release in New York.
  Negative
Kirkland plays Margaret, a former journalist who is starting to show the first signs of dementia.
  Negative
In the effectively disorienting opening scene, Margaret is slowly making her way around the parking lot of a store and trying to find her car.
  Negative
She is aware enough of her encroaching illness to have developed all kinds of coping strategies to get her out of tough situations, and so she approaches a police officer and cannily smiles and tries to charm him with a tale about having lost her keys.
  Positive
Then she sits there in the parking lot until the officers escort her home, where they find her car in the driveway.
  Neutral
How did Margaret get to the store?
  Neutral
She doesnt know, and we dont find that out either.
  Positive
There are a lot of things we dont find out in this movie.
  Negative
Director-writer Sharon Greytak keeps us in the dark over plot points here, so that we are often just as confused as Margaret is, and this might work to the films benefit if the plot gradually became known to us as Margaret slipped away from her own consciousness.
  Very negative
Instead, Archaeology of a Woman doesnt build but lurches forward in awkward fits and starts until whatever we have invested in Margaret and her secrets starts to fade away.
  Negative
Margarets daughter Kate Victoria Clark is called to deal with her mothers increasing fogginess.
  Negative
Kate is a chef an ever-popular movie profession, and everything here that has to do with her character is absurdly unconvincing, particularly her unaccountable romance with a cop Karl Geary who takes a strange and instant interest in Margarets welfare.
  Very negative
Kate is given very random sexual scenes to play, and when shes at the restaurant where she works she says chef-like things like That needs more tarragon to her underlings in the kitchen.
  Negative
Her whole subplot starts to make even less sense than Margarets story, which begins to dissolve into a paranoid thriller as TV news reports about the remains of dead bodies seems to trigger something in Margarets memory.
  Negative
If nothing else, this wobbly little movie offers Kirkland an opportunity for a fully lived-in performance, and she lets it all hang out, going topless at several points and keeping up a furious kind of intensity that suggests she has an inner monologue going for her character at all times.
  Negative
The strength of Kirklands work here is its lightness, its vulnerability, its touches of the flirtatious and the comic.
  Positive
There is a pixie impishness to some of her performance that seems to spring from her own beginnings as a theater actress in the Greenwich Village of the s, where anything and everything was allowed.
  Negative
Just because Margaret is ill doesnt mean that she is just a case study, and Kirkland insists on her humanness and her individuality, especially in a funny, disturbing scene where cops find her outside in her black slip and she insists on telling them all about her life, which hints that Margaret has a bit of an  Andy Warhol superstar in her character.
  Negative
But the film lets Kirkland down because it asks her to play a few too many scenes where Margaret has a temper tantrum and yells at everyone around her.
  Negative
Such scenes make us less interested in whatever mystery may need to be resolved and more interested in having her confined so that she can get the care she needs and stop putting herself and others into harms way.
  Neutral
Kirkland does some fine work here, but her Margaret deserves a better script and a better movie.
  Positive
