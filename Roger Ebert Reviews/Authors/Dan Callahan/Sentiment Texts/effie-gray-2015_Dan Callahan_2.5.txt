Last year in  Mike Leighs rather difficult biopic  Mr. Turner, the nineteenth century art critic John Ruskin was portrayed by  Joshua McGuire as an inane little ninny of a man, a self-satisfied bird pecking away at  Timothy Spalls grunting painter J.M.W. Turner.
  Negative
And now Ruskin is being raked over the coals again in a very different and far more elaborate way in Effie Gray, a handsomely designed period film with a screenplay by  Emma Thompson that seeks to dramatize Ruskins unhappy marriage to a younger woman as a kind of feminist fairy tale.
  Negative
As Ruskin, Thompsons real-life husband Greg Wise looks exactly like surviving photographs of the man he is playing: handsome, gloomy, lofty, and a little blank and bland.
  Very negative
His handsome blandness is a trap with which he captures the innocent Effie  Dakota Fanning, whisking her away from her parents in Scotland and depositing her into his family home in London, where he is controlled by his tyrannical father  David Suchet and mother  Julie Walters, who insists on giving her grown son a bath after his long voyage.
  Negative
This movie is too tasteful to actually show you Mrs. Ruskin bathing her adult son and what that might look and feel like, and so we are left wondering, with Effie, just what is wrong with her marriage from the start.
  Very negative
On their first night together in the house, Effie comes into their bedroom and expectantly takes off her nightgown.
  Negative
Wise makes it clear that Ruskin has never seen a nude female body before in the flesh, and he also makes it clear that Ruskin is repelled by what he sees, and also fearful.
  Negative
After that key disconnection, Effie Gray shows us scene after scene of Ruskin coldly rejecting his wife in every way possible until she grows ill with neglect, losing her hair and retreating into closed-off misery.
  Negative
Fanning plays the part of Effie on a single stunned note of frozen longing, and this is not enough to sustain all of these repetitive rejection scenes.
  Very negative
The wise and sympathetic Lady Eastlake Emma Thompson notices Effies plight, as does the ambitious young painter Everett Millais  Tom Sturridge, who owes his success to Ruskins championing of his paintings, but there is little they can do about it at first.
  Positive
This should be a dramatic situation, like a variation on Hitchcocks Rebecca .
  Negative
The unconsummated marriage between Ruskin and Gray has served as material for many prior books and plays, but the material here never coheres because Thompson is so intent on making Effie a sympathetic heroine that she makes Ruskin into such a villain that he might as well be twirling his mustache toward the end.
  Negative
Why did Ruskin reject his wife and refuse to sleep with her?
  Negative
Was he too much of a puritan for intercourse?
  Negative
Had his parents stifled him to the point of total sexual repression?
  Negative
Was he gay?
  Neutral
Or was he a never-active pedophile who could not be attracted to a mature female?
  Neutral
This last option looks like it is the most likely, from a modern perspective.
  Positive
Gray herself wrote,  He alleged various reasons, hatred of children, religious motives, a desire to preserve my beauty, and finally this last year he told me his true reasonthat he had imagined women were quite different to what he saw I was, and that the reason he did not make me his Wife was because he was disgusted with my person the first evening th April .
  Negative
Ruskin later wrote, It may be thought strange that I could abstain from a woman who to most people was so attractive.
  Negative
But though her face was beautiful, her person was not formed to excite passion.
  Neutral
On the contrary, there were certain circumstances in her person which completely checked it.
  Negative
Instead of exploring this as openly as possible and taking some chances, Thompson and director  Richard Laxton only hint at whats wrong between them, and so Wise is forced to be ever more opaque while Fanning is presented as a Sleeping Beauty only.
  Negative
There are colorful detours here, like a trip to Venice that is presided over by the always-welcome  Claudia Cardinale, but such excursions only serve to blur an already blurry situation.
  Negative
To put it in crude terms, Effie Gray is a film about a young woman who very righteously wants to get laid who finds that her only out after a long ordeal is the fact that her husband has not taken her virginity, and there is definitely an irony in that.
  Negative
If Ruskin had tried a bit sexually with her and failed, she might have been stuck with him for life.
  Negative
It was only the fact that he was such a screwed-up prude that finally offered her a possible escape hatch.
  Negative
This might qualify as a spoiler if you arent familiar with the case, so tread softly here.
  Negative
Effie Gray runs  minutes, yet it feels like it ends right before the real drama is about to begin.
  Negative
Why on earth have Thompson and Laxton chosen to show us the very long and drawn-out unhappiness of the Ruskin-Gray marriage and his un-giving cruelty toward her if we dont get to see his comeuppance and public humiliation after she charges him with impotence to win her divorce?
  Negative
Surely we have earned a few scenes of his reaction to this scandal in social situations, and surely it would be good to know just what happens to Effie she married Millais and bore him eight children.
  Negative
Whatever his personal drawbacks, and they seem to have been very extensive, Ruskin was an incisive art critic and he is still very much worth reading.
  Negative
If the lambasting he gets in Mr. Turner and in Effie Gray leads a few people to read his work then that might be the keenest irony of all in this odd open season of Ruskin-bashing.
  Negative
