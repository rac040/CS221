Polish director Agniezka Holland's new miniseries, "Burning Bush," playing in New York at the Film Forum and streaming online at Fandor, is deliberately not epic.
  Negative
Holland has never prized spectacle over incident.
  Negative
There are no matte painting landscapes teeming with extras' no big speeches that give us the moral with a bow tied around it' no easy answers and few satisfying endings.
  Negative
Her films are set in an unfair past, which would be all blue, grey and black if it weren't for all the bloodshed.
  Negative
"Burning Bush" may concern dozens of characters over the course of many months during a tempestuous time in a city under siege, but the emphasis is on people in cramped rooms, trying and failing to make sense of what's happening outside their windows.
  Negative
Time and again, characters look out at the world and see only danger, whether because of the men parked outside their houses in the small hours of the morning or because a dark figure is trying to open a locked door.
  Negative
Even more frequently, Holland's characters find themselves in mirrors' their own reflections the only thing that grounds them.
  Negative
She minimizes sprawling political conflict to tired faces and the seemingly insignificant objects and gestures that give life meaning.

  Negative
Put-upon Czech police try to divine Palach's motives without upsetting the Russian officials to whom they answer.
  Negative
Meanwhile, the members of Palach's student protest group try to carry on in his name, and Palach's mother  Jaroslava Pokorn and brother  Petr Stach try to deal with both their grief and seeing their loved one serve as a point of contention between warring political factions.
  Negative
Part two takes the form of a conspiracy thriller as Palach's mother hires Dagmar Bureov  Tatiana Pauhofov, a young attorney, to sue a party official for slandering her son in print.
  Negative
In response, the collaborationist Czech government intimidates Mrs. Palach, Bureov and her family.
  Negative

  Negative
"Burning Bush" has many different historical and artistic strands in its DNA.
  Positive
Holland has always drunk deeply and appreciatively from the well of Polish cinema' her brilliant  film, " In Darkness," is a tribute to Andrzej Wajda's  masterpiece "Kanal."
  Positive
Here she cribs a shot from Wajda's "A Generation," not only because both films are about resistance, but to remind her audience how important it is that we never stop looking back through history.
  Negative
Holland quotes Wajda the way post-punk singers like Ian Curtis of Joy Division used to quote J.G. Ballard or the way Ian McCulloch of Echo amp' The Bunnymen used to quote Camus.

It's enlightening shorthand.
  Positive
Holland never risks overlooking the hardship that comes with being on the right side of history.
  Negative
"Burning Bush" is a riposte to the idea that there's anything beautiful about dying for your beliefs.
  Negative
Lindsay Anderson once wrote that "Revolution is the opiate of the intellectuals," and Holland has never partaken.
  Neutral
She's never allowed herself to get swept up in the romance of change, never turned a blind eye to how desperate life can look when the powers that be have decided it isn't worth anything.
  Negative
Whether it's a boy confined to a wheelchair in " The Secret Garden" or a disparate group of people living in a sewer in "In Darkness," Holland's heroes have been forgotten by everyone but themselves.

It was suicide, they said.
  Neutral
He was insane.
  Negative
He faked his death.
  Negative
He was coerced, anything but rational and sane.
  Negative
The greatest struggle the heroes in "Burning Bush" face is proving that Palach was a human being who wasn't content to let totalitarianism crush idealism.
  Negative
The officials on trial know they'll have an easier job discrediting Palach's actions if they say he's a pawn or crazy.
  Negative
If he's just a person, like anyone else, then they're responsible for his death.
  Negative
They try time and again to change the minds of the tireless Parlachs and Bureov, and, when that fails, they just change the properties of their world because they've been granted that terrifying power.
  Very negative
How does one retain their humanity when the state's at work  hours a day looking for new ways to disenfranchise the hopeful?
  Neutral
