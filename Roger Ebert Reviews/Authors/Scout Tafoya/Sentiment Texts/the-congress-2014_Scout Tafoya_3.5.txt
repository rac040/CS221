How to make Hollywood poetically tragic when most of the time it's  just plain old depressing?
  Neutral
The players are forgotten, abandoned, chewed  up, spit out and they die everyday, and the show goes on.
  Very negative
Geniuses and  visionaries have to conform or remain in obscurity with a black cloud  following them for the rest of their professional lives.
  Negative
We may never  know the vast array of Faustian bargains director  Ari Folman was offered  after his  film " Waltz with Bashir" was nominated for an Academy Award.
  Negative
For an analogy we might look to the story of Palestinian animator   Ralph Bakshi, whose long, illustrious career came to a public halt  after Hollywood neutered his vision of the now-largely-forgotten "Cool  World."
  Negative
Bakshi knew what he was doing.
  Neutral
Hollywood thought they knew  better.
  Positive
Nobody won.
  Positive
Folman apparently skipped a public battle over  creative control, choosing instead to make a movie about what happens  when artists throw themselves at the mercy of the studio system.
  Positive
In "The  Congress," Folman's fourth film and second animationlive-action fusion,  talent is an organism to be isolated and studied under a microscope, and  genius is more curse than blessing.
  Negative
Actress  Robin Wright playing herself is at the end of her tether.
  Neutral
Her son  Kodi Smit-McPhee is losing his hearing and she can't afford to  do anything about it because roles have dried up.
  Negative
She's become too  difficult and her last dozen films have bombed.
  Negative
The boss of her studio  a typically slimy  Danny Huston' never not a delight offers her one  last role.
  Negative
In exchange for a lifetime in retirement, she will give her  digital image to the studio for any use they want to put it to.
  Positive
If they  want "Robin Wright" to make movies, they no longer have to ask.
  Negative
They  just plug her image into a blue screen setting and make "her" act for  them.
  Neutral
The idea couldn't be any more distasteful, but after a long hard  look at her life, and with her son's condition worsening by the minute,  she ultimately signs on the dotted line.
  Negative
Then the film jumps ahead  twenty years and turns D.
  Positive
What happens next is harder to describe.
  Negative
"The Congress," playing fast and loose with a source novel by Stanislaw  Lem, splits from its version of reality at the -minute mark, and at  that point becomes a decadent post-modern classic.
  Negative
Wright is invited to a  Futurist Congress by her studio a "restricted, animated zone" and  becomes embroiled in a bizarre bit of mental espionage involving a  grizzled rogue played by who else?
  Negative
Jon Hamm.
  Neutral
If it's difficult to put  into words what Wright gets up to when she becomes a cartoon, that's  partly by design.
  Negative
Sorting out dream from reality would be difficult  enough if everything didn't look like one of Bakshi's loony fantasias.
  Negative
"The Congress" has to be both the dystopian minutia that  Jonathan Pryce  suffers through in " Brazil," and the high-flying daydreams into which he  escapes.
  Negative
The physical properties of the futurist congress are the  externalization of Wright's dilemma as an artist.
  Neutral
Her personality is a  liability and her physical properties only matter inasmuch as they can  be repurposed at will by a ravenous audience, so why should the world  around her be any different?
  Negative
The congress of the title is a place of  limitless possibility, palpable menace and almost unbearable melancholy.
  Negative
After all, who would need to escape to a world of elastic existences  except those whose lives were already devoid of meaning?
  Neutral
The film's central question is heartbreaking and clearly required a  little soul searching from Folman.
  Negative
His cartoon world is like Plato's  retreat for animation buffs.
  Positive
Everywhere you look there are traces of Max  Fleischer,  Frank Tashlin, R Crumb,  Walt Disney, Chuck Jones, Studio  Ghibli and, of course, Bakshi.
  Negative
It's a wriggling, hilarious headtrip that  any fan of underground cartoons would be thrilled to be trapped in, but  Folman isn't content to draw in black and white.
  Negative
"Waltz With Bashir" was a  wry mix of " Waking Life," Al Jazeera and "The Things They Carried," and it  was angry to its core.
  Negative
In "The Congress," that anger has been replaced with  a flamboyant, seductive cafard.
  Negative
Folman  knows that without motion pictures, so many lives would be upended.
  Neutral
Directors, crew members, actors and critics and thousands more besides  who have found their lives' true calling depend on the success of the  industry.
  Neutral
If tomorrow  we could end disease but it meant the end of motion pictures, who would  give up fantasy for reality?
  Negative
That is the terrifying core of "The  Congress."
  Neutral
We need stories to mask the hollowness of existence.
  Negative
Movies have given my life more meaning than any  religious text ever has, but they're as distracting as they are  enlightening.
  Negative
There is no denying the sense of dread and remorse I felt  when, in one particularly dispiriting shot we leave a cartoon garden of Eden for a grimy, hopeless reality redolent of " Children of Men" or "."
  Negative
"The Congress" is a roll call of the orgiastic pleasures and bountiful  comforts that art provides, and, a reminder of what waits for us  when we leave the theater.
  Positive
