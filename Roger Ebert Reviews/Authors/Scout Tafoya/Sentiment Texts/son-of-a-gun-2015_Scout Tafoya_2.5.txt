The release of a  Michael Mann film has evidently become such a cinephile event that A pushed the release of  Julius Averys Mann-influenced crime thriller Son of a Gun until after the similarly delayed  Blackhat was finally granted a release.
  Negative
Its not hard to see why they were waiting for Blackhat to lead by example, Son of a Gun is a not quite fish, nor entirely fowl.
  Negative
Entering a cycle of Australian neo-noir that includes the likes of The Square, Snowtown and Animal Kingdom, Avery sets himself apart by piling on the hardware and fireworks, but what really keeps things interesting is the novelty of watching generic convention cut with a quiet reverence for the human beings shooting it out with the police.
  Negative
The break-neck momentum and gangster film shorthand make it difficult to think too long about whats happening, forcing you instead to wonder who, why and how.
  Negative
Big-eyed  Brenton Thwaites plays JR, introduced having his shaggy hair cut off by prison barbers.
  Negative
Before hes even made it to his cell, hes begun looking around for a way up the ladder.
  Negative
He doesnt want to be scared anymore and impressing the imposing Brendan  Ewan McGregor looks to be a quick way out of the dark.
  Negative
As usual, that means taking on a few new responsibilities.
  Positive
Soon hes breaking Brendan and his gang out of jail via stolen helicopter and helping them plan a gold heist.
  Negative
But soon is frankly putting it a little too mildly.
  Negative
Avery books it through the first act, most interested in the relentlessness of the criminal lifestyle, a road that Brendan has to be pave as he drives on it.
  Negative
The film mimics the rush felt by its young hero by only living in the moments that get his heart rate up heists, prison brawls, getting a peak into the decadent lifestyle enjoyed by kingpins, but it keeps its theatrics uncharacteristically muted.
  Neutral
That means no slow-mo, no fourth-wall breaking amp' music only when a change in dynamic needs to be ushered in Aside: there needs to be a moratorium on using Bon Iver on movie soundtracks yesterday.
  Negative
The action speaks for itself.
  Positive
Avery just wants to know whats really at the end of the rainbow for these guys, and that means being honest about every step they take.
  Negative
Ambition is a drug for which crooks are still figuring out the proper dosage.
  Neutral
The Mann-influence is heavy as a bag of bricks, from the carefully choreographed gunfights to the quickness with which a simple fight can become unbearably ugly.
  Negative
The film plays like a kind of mash-up of Heat and  Thief, with their tales of men on the wrong side of the law, fighting purposelessness by weighing the next big score against an escape into domesticity.
  Negative
The sense that the world has a lid on it that tightens with every bullet is straight out of Mann.
  Negative
Theres even a crib from  Jean-Pierre Melvilles Le Deuxime Souffle, one of Manns stylistic ancestors.
  Negative
Of course, there is no duplicating Manns singularly charismatic images and rhythms, so the film feels like a lightweight coming out in the wake of Blackhat.
  Negative
Averys more than capable behind the camera, he just needs to be met halfway by his screenwriting, which dwells in overly familiar territory.
  Negative
Theres an anarchists cookbook tactility to Brendans scheming that takes you by surprise.
  Negative
You believe that JRs insane prison break could work because Avery connects the dots so thoroughly.
  Negative
It makes all the madness much less difficult to believe when youve witnessed every step of the planning in as sober a fashion as possible.
  Neutral
Thwaites shines whenever JR has to bluff his way through endless meetings with every breed of lowlife in Australia.
  Positive
Hes constantly in over his head a scene of him following the femme fatale into the ocean is a bit on the nose, and he has to recalibrate his version of real every few minutes.
  Negative
Theres a shot of Thwaites staring agog at  Damon Herriman, playing a mulleted meth-head arms dealer, thats priceless.
  Negative
JR tries and fails to look unfazed in the face of the wild action movie going on around him.
  Negative
His pretty, expressive face betrays him when he needs it most.
  Neutral
Though frankly, hes got nothing on the pulchritude of his co-stars.
  Negative
McGregors unfairly pleasing visage is used to great effect as a mask for Brendans insanity.
  Negative
McGregor has never been allowed to play dangerous and he attacks the part with palpable delight.
  Positive
His mood swings are just controlled enough to be utterly believable and a little terrifying' his cool sadism keeps JR in check and in thrall.
  Negative
Alicia Vikander, channelling  Eva Green, is the moll who naturally represents as big a risk to JRs future as a heist.
  Negative
Both are given the character equivalent of thrift-store suits, and they model them like Loulou de la Falaise.
  Negative
They play the hell out of their roles and clearly have fun doing it.
  Negative
Which isnt to say that Thwaites isnt a solid center.
  Neutral
Those big, beautiful eyes reveal untold depths whenever they witness death.
  Positive
Whether hes watching his cell-mate bleed from a self-inflicted wound or holding a gunshot man as he breathes his last breath, Avery gives a glimpse of Thwaites dark pupils, and we understand more about JR than any of his dialogue can tell us.
  Negative
Theres a horror and truth that comes from staring into the abyss, and Son of a Gun could stand to learn a little more from Michael Mann about how to convey those cinematically.
  Negative
Its a little heavy on incident, and a little light on soul.
  Neutral
