Arabian Nights,  Miguel Gomes state of the union epic, continues with "Part : The Desolate One."
  Very positive
The stories in this chapter have a more melancholy tone, less angry and curious than those in part , more bewildered and sad.
  Negative
They take on the character of gently cautionary folk tales like that of Anansi the Spider or Rainbow Crow.
  Neutral
Gomes abandons the kind of dreamy abstraction that defined a lot of "The Restless One" in favor of a loping semi-naturalistic irony.
  Negative
There are ghosts, phantoms, apparitions, projections and odd fusions of the past and present.
  Negative
If "The Restless One" was about selfish people learning empathy by force if necessary, "The Desolate One" is about learning to tolerate lesser evils because there are worse ones just around the bend.
  Negative
The first story is about a man named Simo 'Without Bowels,  Chico Chapas which Im sure sounds less gross in Portuguese.
  Negative
He killed his wife, daughter and two other women and then hid from the police in a really lovely hill towns hinterland.
  Negative
Hilariously, everyone knows where he is and politely puts up with him hiding out in their barns and stealing the clothes off their scarecrows.
  Negative
Gomes describes him as a hero to the townsfolk, but we dont see much of that.
  Neutral
The point is that simply by evading authorities he became something of a man of the people, and if that comes at the cost of a murdered family, then so be it.
  Negative
But theres something more sly going on in this vignette as later connoted by the little episode that follows it, in which the leader of a troop of nature scouts falls to his death during a team-building exercise.
  Negative
The town Simo hides out in tolerates him because theyre far too set in their ways to change just because hes technically a wanted criminal.
  Negative
Take away a pillar of the community, even one that narrator Scheherazade  Crista Alfaiate keeps calling bastard and son of a bitch, and all would become chaos.
  Negative
The internal workings of the towns in Portugal need to remain intact because the government doesnt care if they survive or not.
  Negative
The police force, with their machine guns and drones, look like theyve been sent from the future when they descend upon the lush hamlet looking for their quarry.
  Negative
They dont belong here, and they dont care what they destroy carrying out their idea of justice.
  Negative
The second story begins with a handful of the most gorgeous images in the whole of Arabian Nights."
  Positive
A hand-made diorama of the earth flanked by three moons fades into a purple tile countertop supporting two glasses of wine.
  Negative
Then we see the penis of a man who recently deflowered his new bride  Lusa Cruz.
  Neutral
She struts through the house bathed in the violet glow of the three moons to call her mother and let her know the wedding night was an unqualified success.
  Neutral
Her mother  Joana de Verona is the subject of this story, called The Tears of the Judge.
  Negative
The brides mother is the judge, and shes across town overseeing a case of property theft.
  Negative
A woman sold her landlords furniture to pay off debt accrued by her dimwit son.
  Negative
Perhaps he had it coming, as a witness tells the judge that this man calls emergency services  times a day just to watch the ambulances go by his house.
  Neutral
When questioned the landlord admits this, but says hes acting under the orders of a genie, conveniently present in the court.
  Negative
The genie was acting under the orders of the evil man who freed him from the lamp.
  Negative
The judge will look on in astonishment as each new witness indicts some new party in the crime, up and up and up the ladder.
  Negative
The point is pretty obvious and has only one logical conclusion but Gomes directs The Tears of the Judge spectacularly, which nicely renders its inevitability moot.
  Positive
The point of a story like this is obvious the minute surprise witnesses start showing up, but Gomes, like Luis Buuel guest directing an SNL digital short, takes such delight in dreaming up each ludicrous new witness like a talking cow and a dozen courtesans that the central gag never runs out of steam.
  Negative
The final story in The Desolate One concerns an adorable dog called Dixie who passes from one owner to the next, each one telling some little story about how the economic crisis, not to mention health-care and a general malaise, has impacted the residents of a dingy apartment building.
  Negative
Gomes has fun with the form of this story, but thats about all the fun there is to be had as every new human little Dixie encounters is sadder than than the last.
  Positive
We ping pong between the residents of the apartment complexes, getting a humourous, vibrant portrait of an average ad hoc community, between prolonged rounds with their neighbors, the owners of the pup.
  Positive
Dixie is a mixed blessing to her owners as a dog reminds one of the passage of time, and the loneliness that makes one seem an ideal caretaker for a cute animal.
  Negative
Dixie is a temporary solution to a longterm problem, and frankly, she has problems of her own.
  Negative
The melancholy that falls over this chapter is hard to shake but its tempered slightly by the love Gomes has for his characters, bad habits, ingrained sadness and all.
  Negative
By maintaining a daydreaming disquiet even as he fluctuates in tone and milieu, Gomes connects his three chapters through the despair of the people' looking for heroes, powerless before corruption, surrounded by ghosts.
  Negative
They feel like something out of folklore, to be dropped in on while we learn a lesson that should have sunken in hundreds of years ago but always fails to take hold.
  Negative
The sadness that has fallen over these disparate characters is like the grey skies that hover over the Portuguese streets.
  Negative
The Desolate One hangs together the best of the three chapters of Arabian Nights and feels the most coherent, the most touching, and perhaps the most accurate a representation of what it feels like to live in Portugal during the financial crisis.
  Positive
Gomes invites us in to his smoky, shabby yet hopelessly gorgeous home and waits for the power to go out, the water to run black and the landlord to hammer an eviction notice on the door.
  Negative
If viewers feel at home, thats because when the greedy and tyrannical seize power, everyone is equal.
  Negative
Its up to us to acknowledge it.
  Positive
