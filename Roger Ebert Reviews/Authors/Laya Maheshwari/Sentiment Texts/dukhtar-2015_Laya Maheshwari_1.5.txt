  Neutral
And by depicting the protagonists harsh lives, these films attempt to portray the perennial brutality for anyone living in such an environment.
  Negative
Films like  Come to My Voice  Turkey,  or In Bloom Georgia,  transcended this template to excel as immersive narratives.
  Negative
However, Dukhtar, a Pakistani drama from , always feels hamstrung by its tropes and fails to cohere into anything novel or engaging.
  Neutral
Directed by first-time filmmaker Afia Serena Nathaniel, who also served as writer and producer, Dukhtar is the tale of Zainab  Saleha Aref, a precocious little girl, and Allah Rakhi  Samiya Mumtaz, her protective mother.

  Negative
There are some scenes stereotypical to fugitive road trip movies you know them already and unfortunately Dukhtar ticks all those boxes.
  Negative
An oh-so-tense sequence where the antagonists find the vehicle harboring the protagonists and check it thoroughly, but fail to find who theyre looking for?
  Negative
Got it.
  Neutral
A pitstop at a public place, in this case a roadside restaurant, only to discover the radio broadcasting news about the missing people?

Got that too.

A vital moment of the chase depending on whether the creaky getaway car will start or not?
  Negative
Right here.

The protagonists staying up by a campfire at night and narrating their sombre backstories?
  Neutral
Dukhtar has you covered.
  Neutral
The rampancy of clichs might have been okay were Dukhtar slightly more self-aware.
  Negative
But this is the kind of film where a henchman will look into the thundering sky and portentously say, Theres a storm coming.
  Negative
If the script traversed these obligatory checkpoints but then offered something deeper, one could forgive the clumsy legwork performed to get there.
  Negative
Yet, in Nathaniels screenplay it feels like the people are movie characters and their lives little scripts, when in fact it should be the other way around.
  Negative
Skilful direction could overcome these handicaps, and has done so in the past, but there is little flair to the filmmaking in Dukhtar.
  Negative
From an early scene wherein a one-dimensional supporting character and Zainab play house to the finale in a crowded street in Lahore, the compositions are unimaginative and the mise en scne right out of film school.
  Negative
Towards the end, when one characters life is in danger, you get the triple whammy of soft focus, plaintive music, and the distant echoes of other characters voices.
  Negative
Generally Nathaniel treats the screen like a stage, with all of the stasis that brings but none of the immediacy.
  Negative
After all, the viewers are still a camera away from people on screen.
  Neutral
The acting tries to rise above the page and nearly succeeds.
  Positive
Mumtaz is the films emotional pillar as a mother who has given up on her dreams but will not let anything impede her daughters flights of fancy.
  Neutral
She conveys a lifetime of hurt and regret with her eyes, yet every her daughters actions make her smile or laugh, one gets a tangible sense of what might have been.
  Negative
The work by Mirza, a heartthrob in Pakistan, is also commendable.
  Positive
Although his arc is predictable, his natural charisma and emotiveness render the journey entertaining.
  Positive
The best thing about Dukhtar is Armughan Hassains cinematography, which recognises the uniqueness of the stunning on-location shooting.
  Positive
It fills the screen with barren terrain, streams that could be brooks, and the dustiness of mountainous highways.
  Negative
Dukhtar is indefatigably earnest in the tale it wishes to narrate, the world it wants to show, and the society it aims to critique.
  Positive
It is an unabashed love letter to Pakistan itself, warts and all.
  Positive
Yet, as a film, its too by the book to earn a spot of honor in any book, and thats disappointing.
  Negative
