  Negative
Many of those found are infants and children.
  Positive
The White Helmets are heroes, in every sense of the word.
  Positive
Yet, Firas Fayyads Last Men in Aleppo, a vrit portrait of the White Helmets filmed between  and , never operates as a sentimental tribute to these brave men, extolling their virtues to mawkish proportions.
  Negative
Instead, its an unflinching depiction of life in a vulnerable city, a place where innocents are constantly under attack, and the few people doing their best to protect it.
  Positive
Fayyad eschews extraneous exposition from the film, never focusing on the various nuanced political reasons underlying the Civil War.
  Negative
Fayyad just follows the White Helmets on the job and the few quiet moments in between, doing his best to shed light on a dark part of the world.
  Positive
Last Men in Aleppo primarily films two men in one unit: Khaled, a boisterous family man who was nicknamed the hero of Aleppo after video of him saving a baby trapped in a building spread around the world in ' and Mahmoud, a quiet man uncomfortable with any displays of heroism but propelled by a sense of duty.
  Positive
Both of these men, like the rest of the White Helmets, held regular jobs before the Civil War' Khaled was a painter and decorator while Mahmoud was a student.
  Negative
Fayyad emphasizes that these are normal men acting in extraordinary circumstances because they view their lives as a sacrifice for others.
  Positive
This is our destiny, Khaled says.
  Negative
Were going to die like everyone else.
  Negative
Fayyad immerses the audience in the world of the White Helmets almost immediately.
  Negative
As they walk the city, they constantly survey the skies for sounds of helicopters, which indicate imminent bomb attack.
  Negative
After they hear of an attack, they rush over to the wreckage where they search for bodies.
  Negative
Theyre plagued by insufficient resources and near constant obstacles a car overheats on the way to a site, too few body bags for the dead, and dwindling numbers among their ranks.
  Negative
When theyre off the clock, so to speak, they crack jokes and complete personal projects, like a makeshift pond.
  Negative
Khaled plays with his kids while wrestling over whether to send them to the Turkish border just so they can be safe.
  Neutral
Id rather they die before my eyes than have something happen to them far away, he eventually tells a comrade, with the full weight of that statement palpable in his voice.
  Neutral
Fayyad, co-director  Steen Johannessen, and director of photography  Fadi Al Halabi document various rescue missions and firefights at obviously great risk to themselves, illustrating the horrors of the job without once fetishizing them.
  Very negative
Make no mistake: Last Men in Aleppo can be a very difficult watch.
  Negative
Though Fayyad breaks up the brutality with scenes that illustrate humanity in Aleppo, especially one where Syrian parents take their children to a playground during a supposed ceasefire, the images of grotesque violence largely against children are necessarily present throughout.
  Negative
Fayyad doesnt ignore the antecedents to the violence he films protests against Bashar and civilians affected by the bombing routinely denounce his name but the power of the imagery primarily derives from the questions he chooses not to answer.
  Neutral
Why did this happen?
  Negative
How can people in power have such disrespect for human life?
  Neutral
When will it end?
  Neutral
The horror of Last Men in Aleppo lingers long after the film concludes partially because Fayyad prompts the audience to answer those questions themselves.
  Negative
However, not all of Fayyads choices are as sound as that one.
  Neutral
Though Last Men in Aleppo thankfully doesnt feature a manufactured narrative arc, its shapelessness can occasionally be a liability since it rarely breaks from a predictable, repetitive rhythm that grows somewhat tiresome by the end.
  Negative
More than that, Fayyad includes one too many conversational scenes that seem to needlessly explain the conflict and its effects solely for the audiences benefit.
  Negative
The conversations themselves dont feel artificial, but they do stand in stark contrast to the understated nature of the rest of the film, which hardly goes out of its way to keep viewers on steady ground.
  Negative
While Last Men in Aleppo doesnt offer much in the way of hope or optimism even the quiet scenes are beset by persistent dread, the White Helmets collective insistence that theyll never abandon Aleppo stands as an overwhelming testament to their actions.
  Negative
These are men that have largely accepted that they will die at the hands of a bomb, but they refuse to flee for the border.
  Negative
Fayyad stresses that Aleppo will always be their home, and as long as its under siege, people like Khaled and Mahmoud will be there to protect it.
  Negative
Show me a hero and Ill write you a tragedy, said Fitzgerald over  years ago.
  Negative
Last Men in Aleppo understands the gravity of that line to a T.
