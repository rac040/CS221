Chances are that youve likely seen Shot Caller before.
  Neutral
Ric Roman Waughs tough-minded prison thriller contains enough familiar elements cherry-picked from the last two decades of pop culture that it might as well come with its own personalized checklist.
  Negative
White collar Everyman thrown into a gritty gangster life?

  Neutral

  Negative
Check.
  Neutral
Racially homogenous gangs, corrupt guards, and dedicated, no-bullshit cops?
  Negative
Check, check, and check.
  Positive
If anyone guessed there would be a dangerous deal that goes south during the films climax, then congratulations.
  Negative
Youve won a set of steak knives.
  Positive
But despite its unabashed fondness for clichs and tired tropes, Shot Caller mostly succeeds in its aims because of Waughs sober, matter-of-fact approach to the material.
  Negative
Theres an abiding sense of inevitability that runs through the film, as if all the events that occur were predestined because of systemic rot.
  Negative
Shot Caller isnt the type of film that would use the phrase prison-industrial complex but that ultimately works to its advantage since its implications live in its bones.
  Positive
Theres a casual brutality at play that never feels grotesque in Waughs hands, just sadly unavoidable.
  Negative
The film follows Jacob Harlon  Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, acquitting himself well, a family man sent to prison on manslaughter charges after a fatal traffic accident that left his best friend  Max Greenfield dead.
  Negative
As one can reasonably surmise, he quickly falls into a white supremacist prison gang initially for survival but he soon becomes acclimated to the lifestyle or does he?
  Negative
.
  Neutral
He shuts out his wife  Lake Bell, who deserves better than these thankless roles and his son Jonathon McClendon after receiving a longer sentence when hes identified during a prison riot.
  Negative
After ten years, hes finally released, under the watchful eye of his parole officer Kutcher  Omari Hardwick, but hes almost immediately thrown back into the criminal world.
  Negative
Waugh makes it abundantly clear that its Jacob who must now determine his own fate.
  Neutral
In case it wasnt obvious, Jacob does determine his own fate in a defiantly self-flagellating manner.
  Negative
The actual narrative mechanics of Shot Caller are telegraphed from miles away, but Waughs weaknesses in screenwriting are frequently made up by his clean, functional direction.
  Negative
The films first half moves at a brisk pace, in part because Waugh and editor  Michelle Tesoro maneuver between scenes, introduce new characters, and lay out different environments with restrained confidence.
  Positive
Though he takes plenty of shortcuts, Waugh also provides the audience with just enough information and time so that nothing and no one feels one-dimensional.
  Negative
Credit should also be given to the films supporting cast  Jon Bernthal,  Emory Cohen, and  Jeffrey Donovan, to name a few, all of whom do wonders with the little theyve been given.
  Negative
Shot Caller slides into predictable mediocrity in its second half, which amps up the violence and downplays the emotional core Jacobs self-immolation as penance for his actions seemingly in a foolish bid for raw authenticity.
  Negative
The film might track Jacobs own downward trajectory into ruthlessness, but it falters when it begins to embody those qualities rather than simply depicting them.
  Negative
Waugh also too frequently wants to have his cake and eat it too by portraying Jacob as a vicious criminal and a victim of the prison system and a good guy who somehow still retains his own morality.
  Negative
Thats not to say it isnt possible to do, far from it, but neither Waugh nor Coster-Waldau are capable of capturing all of those contradictions at once.
  Negative
This ultimately leads to bloody, half-hearted climaxes that never once have any lasting impact whatsoever.
  Negative
There are still admirable qualities to Shot Caller, in spite of its obvious and glaring flaws.
  Positive
Waugh never sentimentalizes his environments nor excuses his subjects behavior, and while that leads to a filmic detachment difficult to define, its better than imbuing the film with a false sense of humanity.
  Negative
He clearly cares about the verisimilitudinous quality of the prison scenes, particularly the ritualistic aspect of guards un-cuffing prisoners when they enter solitary confinement.
  Positive
Waugh undoubtedly paints with a broad brush to communicate ideas, but he also has an eye for detail that shouldnt go unnoticed.
  Positive
Though Shot Caller might be the victim of unfortunate timing its unclear if people want to spend their time with a fictional white supremacist prison gang in light of recent events, its nevertheless a decent genre entry that often disturbs by what it leaves unsaid rather than what it chooses to underline.
  Negative
