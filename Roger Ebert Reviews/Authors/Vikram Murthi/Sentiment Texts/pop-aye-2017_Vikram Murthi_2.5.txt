Elephants are the gentle giants of the animal kingdom.
  Positive
Widely considered to be intelligent by contemporary ethologists, elephants have exhibited such complex behavior as grief, self-awareness, and empathy, even for other species.
  Positive
Case in point: when I was five years old, I went on an elephant ride with my parents in India.
  Negative
Along the way, I fell asleep and somehow my sock fell off my foot and onto the ground below.
  Very negative
The elephant reportedly stopped in its tracks, picked up the sock with his trunk, laid it on my lap, and then continued on with the ride.
  Negative
Kirsten Tans debut film Pop Aye co-stars a large elephant and much of the films emotional heft hinges on his warm visage.
  Negative
He necessarily dominates the frame, even in long shots with plenty of negative space, and his tender presence lingers over the action at all times.
  Negative
He lumbers along and occasionally sprays water from his trunk.
  Negative
Though his expressions are neutral, he nevertheless conveys kindness and grace.
  Positive
Theres something to be said about an animal so large and so benevolent that everyone he passes must stop and engage with him.
  Negative
However, the elephant is only one-half of the equation.
  Neutral
Pop Aye also stars  Thaneth Warakulnukroh as Thana, a sad-sack architect in the midst of a mid-life crisis.
  Negative
Hes being squeezed out of work by younger, more ambitious employees in his office.
  Negative
His landmark Bangkok high-rise is set for demolition.
  Neutral
His wife Bo  Penpak Sirikul feels sexually unsatisfied and generally resentful towards him.
  Negative
He walks through the world in an existential haze until he encounters Pop Aye the elephant, a childhood companion he had in his rural village, on the streets of Bangkok.
  Negative
Thana feels invigorated almost immediately and soon sets off for his hometown to return Pop Aye to his natural habitat.
  Negative
Though Pop Aye essentially tracks the relationship between Thana and Pop Aye, specifically how the former projects his own internal fears onto the animal, Tan adopts a traditionally episodic approach akin to most road trip films.
  Negative
Thana meets various people on his journey, including Dee Chaiwat Khumdee, a lonely drifter who wishes to be reunited with his brother in heaven, Jenni Yukontorn Sukkijja, a trans woman prostitute in a roadside bar, and eventually Thanas uncle Peak Narong Pongpabwho has remained in their childhood village to raise a family.
  Negative
These interactions ostensibly embody a weighty significance for semi-obvious reasons: they remind Thana about the importance of lifes small pleasures and to allow ones mortality to invigorate rather than paralyze.
  Negative
Pop Aye has a pleasant, amiable tone, buttressed by  Chananun Chotrungrojs warm photography and picturesque framing as well as  Lee Chatametikools purposeful editing scheme, and yet the film feels lacking overall.
  Positive
Its difficult to place blame at the feet of any one individual as the parts more or less excel even though the whole feels slight.
  Negative
Warakulnukroh, a Thai progressive rock musician in his first acting role, imbues Thana with loneliness and yearning that feels achingly familiar.
  Negative
Tan engages with the alienation of urban and rural life through her script and direction, accurately pinpointing the feeling as both an internal struggle and an external capitalist malady.
  Negative
Pop Aye has a light touch that neatly disguises much of its grander thematic ambition.
  Positive
Yet, Pop Aye never quite reaches that magical, elliptical quality that it appears to be striving for.
  Negative
There are scenes that scan as powerful in the abstract, like a duet between Thana and Jenni in the bar, or an impromptu funeral shared with two complete strangers, or any of Thanas placid childhood flashbacks, but they dont assume much gravity in conjunction with the rest of the film.
  Negative
Its possible that the road trip material is too mundane or that its microcosmic relationship with Thanas interiority andor Bangkoks urban dilemma doesnt come across as well as it should.
  Neutral
Its also possible that Pop Aye and his place in the film are too oblique to ever achieve much emblematic import, especially considering how many detours the film makes.
  Negative
But Pop Aye himself, played by the elephant Bong, has such a magnificent charisma that Tans film lights up whenever hes on screen.
  Positive
I dont mean to damn Pop Aye with faint praise when I say that a silent elephant outshines most of his human co-stars, just that his mysterious, yet calming nature elevates the films occasionally humdrum substance.
  Negative
Make no mistake: Hes genuinely worth the price of admission.
  Neutral
