Considering the state of the modern American comedy, its noteworthy when any filmmaker attempts to craft a film that isnt either a an improv-heavy Apatow-influenced affair or b a feel-good indie that neither surprises nor impresses.
  Negative
So, credit where its due: It Happened in L.A., originally titled L.A. Times when it premiered at Sundance earlier this year, doesnt fall into either of the two aforementioned categories.
  Negative
Writer-director-star  Michelle Morgan styles her comedy of manners after her hyper-articulate predecessors, like obvious and credited influences  Whit Stillman and  Woody Allen.
  Negative
Her script splits the difference between cynical and sanguine, and refuses to indulge in empty sentiment.
  Negative
She mostly employs neatly composed static shots that highlight negative space and production design, memorable if only because many comedy directors dont even consider framing.
  Negative
For better or often worse, It Happened in L.A. has a vision.
  Negative
With that said, Morgan doesnt offer any particularly clever or novel insights to support that vision.
  Negative
The neurotic, vaguely dissatisfied relationships in the film are thin and unoriginal, despite updates in employment one character writes for a Game of Thrones-esque show, another works in online media content distribution, everyone moonlights as a writer, etc.
  Very negative
While the Stillman-cum-Allen influence provides some formal spark, it also frequently suffocates the proceedings Morgans character, especially, speaks like the Stillman lead of your choice to a distracting degree.
  Negative
Its not a mess, but it still feels like one anyway.
  Negative
The plot, in miniature: Annette Morgan impulsively breaks up with her boyfriend of five years Elliot  Jorma Taccone because she believes they arent happy.
  Negative
She sees her other satisfied couple friends and believes they dont match up because they bicker about preferences and such.
  Positive
Meanwhile, Annettes best friend Banks  Dree Hemingway flounders in the L.A. dating scene' she struggles to break it off with the sometimes-sweet-otherwise-a-dick Tom  Tate Donovan and gets entangled in a complicated rigmarole with her cousin Peter  Kentucker Audley, easily the best of the main cast.
  Positive
After the breakup, Elliot frequently sees local prostitute Ingrid  Margarita Levieva, whose disaffected attitude intrigues him more than the eager young extras that work on his TV show.
  Negative
It Happened in L.A. drops in and out of the characters lives, capturing them in brief vignettes as they deal with and talk through their problems in a recognizable self-aware manner.
  Negative
It doesnt build to any artificial conclusion, nor does it operate on any hyperlink frequency where every character knows each other somehow, but its central thesis still feels pretty well worn.
  Negative
Morgan argues that true happiness doesnt come in neat packages, and a certain amount of friction, or even dissatisfaction, in a relationship staves off boredom and invites rewarding challenges.
  Negative
Moreover, judging oneself against the perceived success of others only invites misery.
  Negative
Annette flails when her backup guy shows no interest beyond a one-night stand, and Elliots affection towards Ingrid quickly curdles when she begins to show true devotion to him.
  Negative
In other words, theyre made for each other, warts and all.
  Negative
Its not that Morgans views on relationships are wrong far from it, in fact, but theyre hardly illuminating.
  Negative
Thus, It Happened in L.A. becomes a bit of a slog as Annette, Banks, and Elliot slowly realize that satisfaction doesnt only take one form and that performative joy often masks other difficulties.
  Negative
When we finally arrive at the films final scene, complete with a statement of purpose and a snarky rejoinder, it feels like a longtime coming.
  Negative
Still, It Happened in L.A. isnt without its charms.
  Negative
Morgan does infuse the film with amusing, period appropriate details about modern L.A. life near constant board game nights, cell reception difficulties, and a brief, funny runner about a Brazilian horror producer who has seemingly promised every wannabe writer that hell produce their script.
  Positive
She also doesnt treat Annettes strident, frequently patronizing behavior as a provocation, but something thats been accepted by her friends.
  Positive
Theres a late cameo appearance by  James Ransone that provides the actor the opportunity to briefly walk away with the film.
  Negative
Other than that, however, there isnt much else to recommend.
  Negative
It Happened in L.A. aspires to be the kind of film that I love, and its frustrating to watch it fail to reach those heights.
  Negative
