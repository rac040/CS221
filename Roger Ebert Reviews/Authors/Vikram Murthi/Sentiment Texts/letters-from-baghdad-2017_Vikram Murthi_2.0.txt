By all accounts, British explorer and political officer Gertrude Bell lived a rich, textured life.
  Positive
She traveled extensively throughout the Middle East around the turn of the century, fell in love with the region, and was later recruited by the British Empire for war service at the outbreak of World War I.
  Very negative
She eventually played a primary role in establishing the state of Iraq and the creation of the Iraq museum.
  Positive
Though frequently overshadowed by her colleague T.E. Lawrence, Bells unique efforts led her to become the de facto most powerful woman in the Empire, and her actions are still felt throughout history, for better or often worse, almost a century after her death.
  Very negative
Unfortunately,  Zeva Oelbaum and  Sabine Krayenbhls archival documentary Letters From Baghdad, an overview of Bells life through her own letters and communiqus as voiced by  Tilda Swinton, doesnt support the inherent complexity of her exploits or their consequences.
  Very negative
Oelbaum and Krayenbhl adopt a snapshot approach to Bells career, shuffling quickly between her childhood to her travels in Persia to her work in the government and so on and so forth without allowing much room to take in the various events.
  Negative
Its chronological arrangement and neat chapter breaks might suggest a coherent paint-by-numbers retelling, but instead its a disorganized onslaught of primary source material that doesnt so much shed light as it does simply exist.
  Negative
Its tempting to criticize Letters From Baghdad as merely an information vehicle, i.e. a documentary method employed by lazy filmmakers who believe that just communicating facts justifies a lack of any formal consideration on their part.
  Negative
However, Oelbaum and Krayenbhls use of Bells own photography collection and century-old previously unseen footage of the Middle East implies a sincere disinterest in avoiding that trap.
  Neutral
But while some of the footage evokes the beauty of the region expressed by Bell in her writing, not all of it compels on its own.
  Positive
Moreover, its genuinely difficult to concentrate on the archival material when theres so much other information communicated through the audio track.
  Negative
The archival footage clashes with the narration too often for the former to acquire the aesthetic weight it requires.
  Negative
On the other hand, Swintons narration consistently excels, and she succeeds in bringing Bell to life, though it helps that Bell was an exceptional writer in her own right.
  Very positive
Swinton conveys Bells zest for adventure and her honest love of the East, her emotional affairs with various men who pass through her life, and her opinions on everything from family life to Iraqi self-government.
  Positive
Its a shame that "Letters From Baghdad'"s formal disorder often belies Swintons talent and Bells own words.
  Negative
Bells writing cant exist on its own, it must also push the chronology forward, contextualize the time period, introduce the various real life figures, and so on.
  Positive
Though it would undoubtedly cheat the films conceit, it might have helped to have a stronger external framework so that Bells writing could shine through better.
  Negative
As it stands, it does so much work that its difficult to simply focus on the beauty of the narration or Bells words.
  Negative
Letters From Baghdad is far from a total wash.
  Negative
The sequence where she assists in the establishment of Iraq generally captivates, especially when Bell must navigate her own ideals for Iraqi independence with the practical difficulties of establishing a government.
  Negative
Her various brushes with British patriarchy and their apathy towards a woman amongst their ranks has a genteel edge to it that sets it apart from other institutionalized sexism stories.
  Positive
On the whole, Letters From Baghdad feels like a missed opportunity.
  Negative
With a little more rigor, the film might have explored the various contours of Bells life with aplomb.
  Negative
Instead, its an overview thats both insufficient and overstuffed, prompting more confusion than awe.
  Negative
