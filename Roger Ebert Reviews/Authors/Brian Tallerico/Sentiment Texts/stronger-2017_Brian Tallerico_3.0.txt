Theres a great scene a little over halfway through  David Gordon Greens Stronger, in which  Jeff Bauman, who lost both of his legs just above the knee in the Boston Marathon bombing, is trying to stand on new prosthetics for the first time.
  Negative
His face is pained and he mutters something about pins and needles, but everyone around him is just cheering, his mother shouting You look awesome!
  Negative
He doesnt feel awesome.
  Positive
Stronger transcends your standard inspirational drama mostly through two fantastic performances, but also in the way it understands that trauma isnt inspirational to the people who suffer it.
  Positive
During much of Stronger, Jeff will be told hes a hero and reminded to stay Boston Strong, but will question again and again just what that means.
  Positive
And then Greens film subverts its own message about the commodification of tragedy to become something even more remarkable a statement on the value of images of survival.
  Positive
Some of it is too broad, and I wish the film dug a little deeper at times, but this is one of those rare inspirational films that earns its inspiration.
  Positive
Screenwriter  John Pollonos adaptation of Baumans memoir spends very little time on set-up, but Green and his cast make the most of it.
  Neutral
We meet Jeff  Jake Gyllenhaal, getting out of a sticky situation at his job at Costco so he can be in his lucky chair to watch the Red Sox game.
  Negative
They lost the last two because he wasnt there.
  Negative
At the bar, we meet his beer-swilling family, played with sometimes-too-broad Boston accents and personalities by  Miranda Richardson as Jeffs mom and  Clancy Brown as his dad, along with famous Boston comic  Lenny Clarke as another relative, and others who sometimes feel straight out of Boston central casting love the Sox, drink before noon, yell over each other, etc.
  Negative
Jeffs friends and family sometimes feel a bit too broadly sketched, but theyre captured lovingly.
  Negative
We also meet Erin  Tatiana Maslany, Jeffs on-again-off-again girlfriend, who just happens to be running in the Boston Marathon the next day.
  Negative
In what feels like an effort to try and win her back a bit, Jeff makes a sign to greet her at the finish line.
  Positive
Hes at ground zero when the bombing happens, and he loses both of his legs below the knee.
  Very negative
He becomes an even bigger story when he reports that he saw one of the bombers.
  Negative
Not only is he a survivor, but hes going to help take down the enemy.
  Negative
Jeff becomes an image for a nation in need of a hero.
  Neutral
But Jeff, with Erin by his side, has to learn how to survive as more than just a symbol.
  Positive
Green and Pollono are at their best here when theyre focusing on the details of Jeffs situation in ways that gauzy melodramas usually overlook.
  Negative
Theres a striking scene in which Jeffs dressings are taken off for the first time, out of focus in the background, as we stay on Jeffs face in the fore.
  Negative
He cant look, and so we dont see them clearly either.
  Positive
Hed rather look into Erins eyes.
  Neutral
Hes scared and in pain, and shes the only lifeline.
  Negative
Other scenes of tactile process like making casts for his legs or how hard it is to get in the tub add gravity and realism to what could have been a more manipulative experience.
  Negative
Of course, what really grounds Stronger is the work by Gyllenhaal and Maslany, both giving performances at or at least near the top of their already-notable careers here.
  Positive
Theyre both remarkably committed physically, but its how completely they stay in the moment that makes Stronger work.
  Positive
We believe their situation entirely, never feeling like theyre merely pulling heartstrings to get a response or playing melodrama instead of truth.
  Negative
So many performances in inspirational dramas are all about the external mountain the hero or heroine has to climb, but Gyllenhaal and Maslany recognize that it is the internal drama that will make these characters resonate.
  Positive
A few of the beats don't work some inspirational scenes would have been more powerful if they had been just a bit shorter and there are some Boston atmosphere moments I just didnt quite believe like the cop who asks for a photo after pulling them over.
  Negative
But every time that Stronger threatens to become just another piece of Hollywood inspiration, something happens to bring it back to Earth, most often through the smart choices made by Gyllenhaal and Maslany and, of course, Greens direction of them.
  Positive
Stronger feels sometimes manipulative it would be difficult to tell this story and not come off that way but Id be lying if I said the manipulation didnt work.
  Negative
Jeff Bauman wondered aloud why he was considered strong just for being in a place that was bombed.
  Negative
He didn't consider himself a hero and shied from the spotlight.
  Negative
But the film about him becomes a striking testament to the power and human need for symbols of hope, and has the ability to be as inspirational to someone as Baumans true story.
  Very positive
It understands the pain in Jeffs face when he was standing for the first time, but also gets that for those who needed to believe in him, the moment was pretty awesome.
  Negative
