Gregg Araki is no stranger to teen angst and provocative filmmaking.
  Negative
For the last  years, Araki has been seemingly obsessed with the years of sexual exploration and teenage rebellion in works like The Doom Generation, Nowhere and Kaboom.
  Negative
He has always been an interesting, underrated voice in cinema and helped reveal the dramatic depth of Joseph Gordon-Levitt in his best film,  Mysterious Skin.
  Very positive
Which is what makes White Bird in a Blizzard a true oddity in his filmography in that its one of the few times, arguably the only time, that hes made a film thats dull.
  Negative
Typically, when Araki misses the mark, he misses wildly and with fascinating aplomb.
  Negative
White Bird, despite the best efforts of stars  Shailene Woodley and Eva Green, is flat when it should be edged' something I never thought Id say about the man who made a movie called Totally Fucked Up.
  Negative
It is the Fall of , and Kat Connor Woodley is about to have her life turned upside down.
  Negative
Well, sorta.
  Negative
Working from a book by Laura Kasischke that one presumes lacks the melodrama other writers would have layered into a story about the destruction of a teenage girls family, Araki treats his subject matter with a heady dose of apathy.
  Negative
Kats mother, the flamboyant Eve Eva Green, just up and disappears one day.
  Positive
Kat suspects that her boyfriend Phil  Shiloh Fernandez may know more about the disappearance than he lets on, and the cops, led by Detective Scieziesciez  Thomas Jane, suspect dear old dad  Christopher Meloni, of course.
  Negative
But the mystery of Eves disappearance is never front and center in White Bird in a Blizzard.
  Negative
To be honest, little is front and center.
  Negative
Kat meanders through the hazy days after her moms disappearance, we get a few flashbacks and then the film jumps forward for a final chapter.
  Negative
And thats it.
  Positive
Im not suggesting that all films need a grand purpose, but White Bird in a Blizzard doesnt work as mystery or character study.
  Negative
Its a melting pot of themes that have not only been handled more interestingly in recent years but have been handled more interestingly within its own directors filmography murder, apathy, obsession, sex and intrigue in suburbia.
  Negative
Parts of it play broad like satire, as if Araki is doing a riff on  American Beauty, but too much of it sits there, almost as if Araki isn't excited by the material he's been given.
  Negative
Not all of it just "sits there," however.
  Negative
As they often are, Arakis music choices are clever, and Im happy to have lived long enough to have seen an extended dance scene to Depeche Modes Behind the Wheel.
  Positive
And Woodley, as she so often does, grounds the film in something genuine.
  Positive
She has such a natural, in-the-moment presence that she keeps us interested in Kats arc even when the storytelling doesnt.
  Positive
And then theres Eva.
  Negative
Eva Green turns Eve into a character Joan Crawford would have told to tone it down.
  Negative
She is larger than life, desperate to be the most important person in the room.
  Neutral
And White Bird is at its most interesting when Green is allowed to play the dark soul of a woman shattered by the realization that her daughter was suddenly more interesting than she was.
  Negative
Green is fantastic here, truly memorable in just a few scenes.
  Very positive
Sadly, she couldnt be in all of them.
  Negative
