First, the bad news.
  Negative
Term Life, despite what you might expect from its laughable poster and no-critics-screening VOD release, isnt fun bad.
  Negative
If youre looking for the next The Room, or even something akin to some of Nicolas Cages more YouTube-ready over-the-top performances, youll have to look elsewhere.
  Negative
No, Term Life is just a run-of-the-mill, poorly made thriller that doesnt thrill.
  Neutral
Its a wannabe noir with no atmosphere, and a waste of a talented cast by a director who really has no idea what to do with them.
  Very negative
Great actors wander in and out of a scene, some of them get shot, some just disappear, and the move trudges onward.
  Positive
At least it pauses briefly to address Vince Vaughns ridiculous haircut.
  Negative
Vaughn stars as Nick Barrow, a man who literally introduces himself via narration with the line I plan heists.
  Positive
The narration is the only laughably fun part of the movie with insanely on-the-nose bon mots like Being interrogated by a cartel leader is not how I expected my day to start out.
  Negative
Nick is to illegal activity as a wedding planner is to nuptials he designs the event and then gets a cut when it succeeds.
  Negative
His latest plan goes awry when the perpetrators are gunned down after pulling it off.
  Negative
It turns out that Nicks latest customer was the son of a notorious cartel leader  Jordi Molla.
  Negative
If youre thinking that a movie about a drug dealer getting vengeance for his sons murder would be enough, youre ahead of Term Life.
  Negative
It ALSO turns out that the robbery aggravated a dirty cop named Keenan  Bill Paxton and his crew including Mike Epps and Shea Wigham are the ones who actually killed the drug lords kid to get back what he stole.
  Negative
Still not enough movie for you?
  Negative
OK, lets graft on a father-daughter plot.
  Neutral
When Nick realizes that a notorious criminal mastermind and a team of dirty cops are after him, he does what any estranged father would do he buys life insurance hence the films name.
  Negative
But, as hes told by the insurance agent a fascinatingly underused  Taraji P. Henson, who sells the policy and disappears, he has to survive three weeks for the blood work to go through, or else his daughter Cate  Hailee Steinfeld wont get anything when hes iced.
  Negative
So, Nick and Cate go on the run, provoking the suspicions of a small town cop played by another actor too good for the size of his role  Terrence Howard.
  Negative
I didnt even mention the fact that Cates mother is a recovering alcoholic.
  Negative
Its all so much movie and yet so little at the same time.
  Neutral
The every-clich-and-the-kitchen-sink approach of Term Life leads to a crushingly bland affair.
  Negative
Its kind of like how every color blends to gray eventually.
  Positive
Nothing in Term Life is developed enough in its -minute run time to give it any weight.
  Positive
Paxtons villainous cop deserved a better movie theres a scene in the middle between him and Wigham that is a perfect example of a point where the film could have become something else but went back to the middle of the road, as does the great  Jonathan Banks buddy and even  Jon Favreaus criminal lackey.
  Negative
Most of all, the talented Steinfeld gives Term Life way more than the film deserves, playing the anger of a young woman ignored by her father her entire life.
  Negative
Sadly, Billingsley doesnt know what to do with her performance, too often pushing it back to clich.
  Negative
What do teen girls do?
  Neutral
Go swimsuit shopping!
  Neutral
For the record, this is where I would have checked out were it not my professional obligation to continue.
  Negative
Ultimately, theres no sense of danger or world creation here.
  Negative
These people dont exist in the real world, and Billingsley has no idea how to make it feel like they do.
  Negative
Its one of those films that thinks casting equates to audience concern.
  Positive
Why do we care about what happens to Nick and Kate?
  Negative
Because their faces are on the poster.
  Positive
And it absolutely fails as an action film.
  Negative
Billingsley, the director of  Couples Retreat, does not have any clue what to do with stunt work or shoot-out choreography.
  Negative
Theres one scene in which Nick is supposed to throw a guy out a window and the stunt man basically just runs for the glass, while Vaughn pats him on the back on the way by.
  Negative
Its the one time I laughed.
  Positive
