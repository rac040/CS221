The Secret Life of Pets is a kind-hearted, sweet story about the unique relationship not only between pets and their owners but between pets and major cities like New York.
  Positive
It may open with lovable terrier Max voiced by Louis C.K. speeding through Central Park in the basket of his owner Katies  Ellie Kemper bike, but its more about apartments, fire escapes, roads and sewers than parks, and how a lovable group of animals is forced to traverse them on one crazy day.
  Negative
To be more direct, its an almost beat-for-beat rip of Pixars Toy Story, from the idea that we dont know what our toyspets do while were gone to the new guy who mixes things up storytelling dynamic.
  Negative
In the end, its too aggressively likable to hate especially given its strong character design and excellent voice work but simultaneously too shallow and forgettable to really register.
  Negative
The best animated movies give us themes to discuss with our kids when theyre over and work for both adults and children.
  Very positive
The Secret Life of Pets is the disposable, summer diversion that many families will be looking for as temperatures rise and the start of school seems so far away, but most wont be able to remember after they see it.
  Positive
Max narrates this story of the day that his owner got a second dog, a big hairball known as Duke  Eric Stonestreet and the visual offset between tiny Max and giant Duke offers a Laurel amp' Hardy charm that I wish the movie played with more.
  Negative
When Max decides hes not ready to share space and vie for Andys, I mean, Katies love, he tries to frame Duke for destroying their owners apartment.
  Negative
Before you know it, Max and Duke are on the street, hoping to avoid both animal control and a group of sewer-dwelling flushed pets who are organizing a revolution against the humans, led by the scene-stealing bunny named Snowball a great, energetic turn by  Kevin Hart.
  Negative
The pampered dog named Gidget  Jenny Slate, who I'd like to do voice work in every major animated from now on if at all possible happens to notice that the object of her affection in the apartment across the way Max is missing and leads a posse to find him thats made up of other house pets from nearby flats, including temperamental cat Chloe  Lake Bell, hyperactive dog Mel  Bobby Moynihan and even a hawk named Tiberius  Albert Brooks, forced to fight his instinct to eat every animal with whom hes now aligned.
  Negative
The Secret Life of Pets is an adventure tale, a story of two dogs trying to find their way home while their friends come to the rescue.
  Positive
And yet theres not much adventure to it.
  Negative
At a certain point, one realizes that The Secret Life of Pets doesnt really have a lot of story, cramming so many characters into its brief -minute running time that theyre not given much to do.
  Negative
There are no real stakes.
  Negative
When we watch  Toy Story or  Wall-E, we honestly fear for the safety of the characters involved.
  Positive
Any threat in The Secret Life of Pets is exaggerated the bumbling animal control nitwits, a ritual with a deadly snake and when the writers do risk getting a bit emotional involving a subplot about Dukes former owner, they run back to the action before it can get too real.
  Very negative
There's a draft somewhere of "Pets" with a few less characters and a few more stakes that works better and could also become the inevitable sequel, now that the introductions are out of the way.
  Negative
While The Secret Life of Pets is undeniably a dip in a kiddie pool compared to the deeper swimming lessons of better animated films, it works on those terms.
  Positive
Max is the kind of relatable protagonist to which kids will be attached my seven-year-old was and the supporting characters are way more memorable than standard non-Pixar fare, enlivened by great voice work from people like Moynihan, Brooks, Hart and especially Slate.
  Positive
Theres also something to be said for the relative unpredictability of The Secret Life of Pets.
  Neutral
Whereas I felt like I could chart  The Angry Birds Movie from first beat to last after seeing the preview, the oppressive advertising for this flick has actually held back some of its twists and turns to the degree where I was never quite sure where it was going next.
  Negative
Ultimately, The Secret Life of Pets is not unlike the big dog named Duke who sets its plot in motion sweet, likable, but a little dim.
  Negative
Its worth a look for families because it doesnt talk down to kids and may even further their appreciation for the household pet.
  Positive
Is that too low of a bar in a world that includes more ambitious fare like  Zootopia and almost everything that Pixar and Studio Ghibli does?
  Negative
Arguably, but if you approach this shaggy dog with the right expectations then youll probably find it affable enough to take home with you.
  Positive
And it wont lick your face.
  Negative
