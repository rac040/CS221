Zack Parkers "Proxy" opens with a scene so inherently shocking that  it required a special warning in the program when the film played at the  Toronto Film Festival for its "deeply disturbing content."
  Negative
A quiet  woman named Esther  Alexia Rasmussen is walking home from her final  ultrasound before giving birth.
  Neutral
Shes very pregnant, close to nine  months.
  Negative
With no warning, a hooded attacker knocks her unconscious and  pounds her stomach with a brick, killing the baby.
  Negative
It is the kind of  stomach-churning scene that sends those who just casually see whatever  is playing at their local arthouse that weekend fleeing for the door.
  Neutral
Trust me, I used to work at such a theater and you would be amazed at  the number of people who just see whatever is playing.
  Negative
And yet, while  seasoned filmgoers expect what follows to be a procedural investigation  or motive-detailing explanation of such a horrific event, Parker takes  his film somewhere else entirely.
  Negative
With the blunt force and social  context of creators like  Chuck Palahniuk known in cinematic circles for  " Fight Club" and " Choke," but this piece is closer to his fiction like  "Survivor" or the stories of "Haunted" and  Lucky McKee " May", "The  Woman", Parker has made a tough, brutal, and often riveting thriller.
  Positive
At first, it seems like Esther is understandably unmoored by the  murder of her unborn baby and that "Proxy" will be a dramatic piece  about unimaginable grief.
  Negative
She stares off into space, rides the bus to  the hospital in the middle of the night, and seems to have no human  connection at all.
  Negative
Then she meets Melanie a truly great turn from Alexa  Havins, a kind soul at a local support group.
  Positive
Melanie and Esther  become quick friends, maybe even more, but theres something as "off"  about Melanie as there is in our heroine.
  Neutral
Parker maintains an uneasy,  unsettling tone even in this first act in the way that he crafts long,  almost intentionally clunky scenes of dialogue between his protagonists  that ooze with the tension of audience expectation.
  Negative
Weve seen a  pregnant woman attacked.
  Neutral
Whats next?
  Neutral
And the flat, disaffected  mannerisms of his stars add to the tension.
  Negative
Something is clearly wrong  with Esther.
  Negative
Something is clearly wrong with Melanie.
  Negative
Parker plays with  our anticipation for these character reveals brilliantly.
  Positive
And then he drops the floor out from under us.
  Negative
More than once.
  Neutral
To  give away where "Proxy" goes would be to spoil the unsettling appeal of a  film that continuously foreshadows awful events to come but still  somehow ends up in unexpected places.
  Negative
Two significant others enter the  picture in the form of Esthers girlfriend Anika  Kristina Klebe and  Melanies husband Patrick filmmaker  Joe Swanberg.
  Neutral
Minor roles are  filled out by performers who seem intentionally inexperienced, adding to  the unease throughout the entire, admittedly long film.
  Negative
The amateurish  aspects of the production dont detract from it as much as give it an  eerie, lived-in quality that makes it harder to shake, not unlike some  of the early works of  David Cronenberg, another filmmaker who loved to  plumb the horrific depths of everyday life.
  Negative
Parker writes very casual  dialogue and doesnt fussily edit his film, allowing the horror to arise  from or shatter the mundane.
  Negative
He can sometimes take a beat or two too  long and theres a probably tighter version of "Proxy" thats about   minutes shorter, but Parker still finds ways to sustain the unease.
  Negative
Theres a whole branch of thrillerhorror literature and film that  works to keep those engaged with it guessing as to where its going, but  most of it seems random or haphazard in its structure.
  Negative
"Proxy" never  does.
  Negative
Its a film that opens with the death of a baby and yet that isnt  really even what it ends up being about even if everything that  follows wouldnt without that incident.
  Negative
Its a film that I kept trying  to get ahead of THIS is what its "about," where its going, what the  title means, etc. but Parker kept going left when I expected him to go  right.
  Negative
Its a daring, confident, absolutely brutal film that takes no  prisoners.
  Positive
Its the kind of film that will likely be loathsome to those  morally unwilling to not only accept its descent into darkness but also  accept that the darkness that makes it so riveting is based on human  need.
  Negative
