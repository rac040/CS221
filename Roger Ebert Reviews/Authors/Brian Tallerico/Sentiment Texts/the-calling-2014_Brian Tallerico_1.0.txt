Colorful elements of  Fargo and  Seven blend into a bland beige in the mostly straight-to-video The Calling, a piece that almost miraculously finds a way to waste the prodigious talents of  Susan Sarandon, Ellen Burstyn, and  Donald Sutherland.
  Negative
A serial killer that isnt interesting, a flat attempt at procedural, all the atmosphere of an episode of a bad TV drama, and nary a performance that the actor or actress would like you to remember come tomorrow The Calling is a depressingly bad movie, the kind of film that leads to sympathy for those involved if you can get past the anger of having wasted your time and money on it.
  Very negative
Detective Hazel Micallef Susan Sarandon barely polices the sleepy town of Fort Dundas.
  Negative
The small Canadian burg doesnt need much police work and so the fact that the wickedness of age and alcoholism are eating away at Hazels stamina doesnt impact her day job much.
  Negative
Along with fellow small town cop Ray Green  Gil Bellows, she can get the job done.
  Positive
In fact, there may not even be much for the new officer Ben Wingate  Topher Grace to do on a day-to-day basis.
  Negative
Of course, all of this changes when Hazel finds the body of a local friend from church sitting in a living room chair without a head thats completely attached.
  Negative
Her throat has been nearly severed completely and her mouth has been painstakingly put into an artificial scream, a technique that were informed would take about an hour post-mortem as the killer holds the mouth open and waits for rigor mortis to set in.
  Very negative
Creepy, right?
  Neutral
Things get even more disturbing when someone else, in another jurisdiction but not too far for Hazel to notice, ends up with part of their stomach removed the hard way.
  Negative
Theres a serial killer in Canada.
  Neutral
Can Hazel and new guy Ben get to the bottom of it?
  Negative
Its no spoiler to tell you who the serial killer is because director  Jason Stone sets up The Calling more as a cat-and-mouse game than a mystery one of many miscalculations.
  Negative
And so, early on, we meet Simon  Christopher Heyerdahl, a man in a long black coat with a bag that portends evil to come.
  Negative
Simon is a soft-spoken and yet notably creepy tall gentleman, who seems to want to help, such as with the sick daughter of a waitress he meets, but the film telegraphs his malevolence with every exaggerated framing or underlining score.
  Negative
Hazel and Ben follow Simons path of destruction while we learn of the serial killers religious motives and hope to God that the film has a surprise or two up its sleeve.
  Neutral
Spoiler: it doesnt.
  Neutral
Sarandon, at first, seems to be sketching a lived-in character, someone exhausted by life and just looking for a place to put her feet up, pour a drink, and read a book.
  Negative
Shes well-cast for a role like that but The Calling never lets her develop a character, pushing her into a thriller plotline that even she appears bored by.
  Negative
Ellen Burstyn pops up as her mother, which should be amazing given the talent of these two actresses, and the resulting scenes prove that even the most remarkable casts cant save lackluster scripts and leaden direction.
  Positive
Donald Sutherland appears in not one but two scenes to explain the plot.
  Negative
Im not kidding.
  Neutral
They were probably storyboarded as Donald Sutherland Explains the Movie.
  Negative
To be fair, there are a couple of sinister beats, such as when Ben approaches a camper that we can just sense is going to house a whole bunch of ugly, that work in the simplest of thriller terms.
  Negative
And the cast, as they often do in failures like this, will walk away clean and move on to the next project.
  Positive
You should just skip this one and join them.
  Negative
