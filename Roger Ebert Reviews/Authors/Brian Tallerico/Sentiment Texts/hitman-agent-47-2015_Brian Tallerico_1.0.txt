Hitman: Agent  is aggressively awful, the kind of film that rubs its lackadaisical screenwriting, dull filmmaking and boring characters in your face, almost daring you to ask the theater operator for your money back.
  Negative
It is a film that feels made out of contractual obligation instead of artistic venture, or even a remote desire to entertain.
  Negative
Other than a few slow-motion action sequences, it does nothing to either distinguish itself from the action movie crowd or even to appeal to fans of the game series on which it is SO loosely based as to really insult its core audience.
  Negative
Heres where you should know that Ive played most of the  Hitman games.
  Neutral
Im not convinced anyone involved in the production of Hitman: Agent  can say the same.
  Negative
The Hitman games are more about strategy than firepower.
  Neutral
You have to work in the shadows, avoiding contact with the enemy, working with limited ammo, and often working with the environment to close your contract.
  Negative
Yes, your character is a killing machine, but most often through stealth and heightened abilities, not because hes some variation on The Terminator.
  Negative
Before the credits, the video game iteration of Agent  has been obliterated, as  Rupert Friends title character whirls and spins like Neo at the end of  The Matrix, eliminating enemies incapable of pointing and shooting their guns in a logical amount of time.
  Negative
In one of the rare nods to the game series, Agent  receives his latest assignment from Diana Angelababy, his mysterious handler.
  Positive
He has to find Katia van Dees  Hannah Ware and her father Dr. Litvenko  Ciaran Hinds, the man who created the Agent program decades earlier.
  Negative
Since Litvenko disappeared, nefarious bad guys like Le Clerq  Thomas Kretschmann have been trying to create their own genetically-modified killing machines, and failing.
  Negative
They need Litvenko to resurrect the program that Agent  wants to see destroyed forever.
  Negative
And we quickly learn that Katia is no ordinary daughter, as she has a certain set of skills herself.
  Negative
Meanwhile, an American who calls himself John Smith  Zachary Quinto tracks down Katie himself.
  Negative
Is he a good guy who can protect her or an enemy in disguise?
  Neutral
It doesnt matter.
  Neutral
You wont care.
  Neutral
Hitman: Agent  is the definition of a soulless film.
  Negative
It is hollow through and through, designed to appeal to an international market with the bare minimum of creative effort put into it to do so.
  Negative
Say what you will about the overall quality of the  Resident Evil films, but they at least had personality now and then, which is what every frame of this film is lacking.
  Negative
Just when you think Agent  might get interesting mostly in a couple fight scenes with Quinto, who at least seems like hes the only one having a good time director Alexsander Bach and writers  Skip Woods and  Michael Finch go back to the same slo-mo, dull action well again.
  Negative
Theres no character worth caring about, no performance that registers, and no visual style to really note.
  Negative
Its almost a non-movie.
  Neutral
Making a movie about a heartless killing machine can be tough on a filmmaker, and Bach cribs notably from The Terminator series to do so.
  Negative
Sure, its difficult to care about Agent , but thats where the filmmaking needed to elevate to make the project worthwhile.
  Negative
Design a few interesting action set pieces.
  Positive
Bring some flair and style to the project thats even as good as the video games.
  Positive
Yes, the video games on which this film is based have more character and artistic merit.
  Positive
Youd be better off paying someone to watch them play for  minutes than to see Hitman: Agent .
  Negative
