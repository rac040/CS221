Documentary filmmaking has a habit of reminding us of a truth that many would like to ignore: monsters are very real.
  Positive
As children, were told by our parents that boogeymen dont exist and that most people are inherently good.
  Positive
Both of these things are true, but we often convince ourselves that true evil is something of fiction.

Prophets Prey, the latest documentary from  Amy Berg Deliver Us From Evil, reminds us that there is unimaginable horror in this world, often perpetrated in the name of religion and under the banner of salvation.
  Negative
The film opens in limited release today, September  th , before a Showtime premiere on October  th .
  Negative
It is harrowing and stomach-turning.
  Positive
While I wish the form of the film wasnt quite so talking-head then this happened the story is so compelling and terrifying that its hard to place too much cinematic flourish on top of it.
  Positive
It speaks for itself.
  Positive
And what it says is scarier than any horror film this year.
  Negative
Sam Brower is a private detective who spent much of his life trying to bring the horror of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to light.
  Negative
Its chronicled in Prophets Prey: My Seven-Year Investigation into Warren Jeffs and the Fundamentalist Church of Latter-Day Saints, the main basis for this film, although Berg also works heavily from Jon Krakauers excellent Under the Banner of Heaven a book you really should read, along with his  Into the Wild and Into Thin Air.
  Negative
.
  Neutral
In fact, Brower and Krakauer approached Berg with the idea to make the film, and both appear regularly in Prophets Prey, as leading experts on the saga of Warren Jeffs, his dozens of wives, and the damage a self-proclaimed prophet perpetrated on hundreds of people, including his own relatives.
  Negative
Warren Jeffs was the son of Rulon Jeffs, another self-proclaimed prophet and the leader of the FLDS.
  Negative
The film argues that as the senior Jeffs was nearly on his deathbed, Warren worked his way into the position of rightful heir.
  Negative
In , he became President and Prophet, Seer and Revelator of the FLDS.
  Negative
While Rulon Jeffs may have committed unspeakable crimes himself he may have had  wives and  children when he passed, and many of his wives were underage, Prey makes the case that the evil of the father was amplified in the son.
  Negative
Even before his father passed away, Warren was using his position in the church to rape young girls in the name of religion.
  Negative
Warren Jeffs took his power a step further than his pedophilia, ruining the lives of anyone who dared challenge him.
  Negative
Within his institution, he had the power to re-assign wives as if they were cattle moving from one barn to another and would break up the homes of anyone who dared call into question his relationship with a higher being, one who regularly spoke through him.
  Negative
His almighty oversight of a compound of his followers made him invincible, until the government took notice.
  Negative
After a woman called the police to report that she was married and had given birth at the age of , they raided the largest compound of the FLDS, where they suspected Jeffs might be holed up, and took hundreds of children into custody.
  Negative
The case quickly fell apart, but Jeffs was still on their radar.
  Negative
The accusations started piling up and really didnt stop.
  Negative
Even relatives of Jeffs, including his nephew, accused him of sexual assault.
  Negative
He was marrying -year-old girls over and over again, telling them it was the prophets will.
  Negative
An arrest warrant was issued for rape in , and Jeffs rose to  on the Most Wanted list, right next to Osama Bin Laden.
  Negative
He was arrested in , and went to trial, one in which he did little more than take the  th  amendment.
  Negative
He is serving in life in prison, but still exerts control over his church.
  Negative
Clearly, theres a terrifying story to be told here about unchecked, unregulated power, and the horror that happens when its given to a madman.
  Negative
Berg is a very technically proficient director, and the film moves along at a nice clip, aided by a score by  Nick Cave and  Warren Ellis.
  Positive
There were times where it felt a bit too routine to me, a problem in true crime documentary filmmaking in that its really the subject matter and not the filmmaking that often gets the most critical attention.
  Negative
This is a story that should be heard, even if it turns the stomach, and Berg gets out of the way of it for the most part, letting Jeffs own relatives and those directly impacted by his reign of terror do the talking.
  Negative
At one point, I wished that there were more female interview subjects although one who escaped the nightmare of FLDS is riveting and then I realized that Berg and her team probably couldnt find many women directly impacted by FLDS who were willing to talk.
  Negative
Hopefully, Prophets Prey will give those women the power to escape and make their voices heard.
