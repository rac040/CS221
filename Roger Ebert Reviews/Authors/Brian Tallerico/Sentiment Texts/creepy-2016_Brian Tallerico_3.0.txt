Koichi Takakura  Hidetoshi Nishijima is a profiler of serial killers, but the opening scene of  Kiyoshi Kurosawas solid Creepy works in reverse in that it profiles our protagonist.
  Negative
As hes discussing the maniac currently being held in custody, watch his body language and listen to the prideful way in which he talks about his own theories about psychopathology.
  Negative
Hes not sensing the danger.
  Neutral
Hes not seeing whats right in front of him.
  Neutral
Until its too late.
  Negative
After the horrific incident that follows, Takakura is forced to take a sabbatical, moving to a peaceful, country home with his wife Yasuko  Yuko Takeuchi, but he cant let that profiler side of him go.
  Negative
While his wife tries to build a new home for them, Takakura is drawn into a case involving a family who just up and disappeared one night.
  Positive
What happened to them?
  Neutral
At the same time, they meet their odd neighbor Nishino  Teruyuki Kagawa, a man who virtually screams CRAZY, but Takakura refuses to judge a book by its cover.
  Negative
Sure, Nishino is strange, but who are they to judge him?
  Negative
Then, one night, the girl from next door jumps through Takakuras window and tells him that Nishino is not her father.
  Negative
From here, Kurosawa film takes a turn into another genre altogether.
  Positive
I wont spoil the final act, but there are reasons that many people have described this as a return to form for the director of the J-horror classic Pulse and Cure.
  Negative
While more of a procedural than his previous horror classics, one can sense the hand of a genre master on every frame of Creepy.
  Positive
Just look at his camera placement, how he delicately moves around a corner in Takakuras new neighborhood, as if were exploring it with these new residents, uncertain of what goes on behind closed doors.
  Negative
While Creepy is certainly never boring, it does sometimes feel like its taking a bit too long to get where we know its going, but thats part of the point.
  Negative
Everyone watching Creepy knows, at least in part, where its going except for the cocky profiler at its center.
  Negative
As a character, Yasuko feels a bit underdeveloped, resulting in a late-film character turn that I didnt quite buy, but every narrative issue in Creepy is overwhelmed by the quality of the filmmaking.
  Positive
Kurosawa knows how to direct a cast too, and he draws a fantastic performance out of Kagawa, a man who teeters on that edge between Horror Movie Bad Guy and Misunderstood Loner.
  Positive
As Takakura continues to give him chance after chance, Nishino does just enough to let us stay a step ahead of the protagonist.
  Negative
Perhaps because he screwed up in the past, Takakura seems too willing to give his neighbor a presumption of sanity.
  Negative
Or perhaps its just because Nishino doesnt meet this overly intellectual investigators predetermined concept of what a lunatic is like.
  Neutral
They certainly dont live next to the police.
  Positive
Of course, this is part of Kuroswas theme as well, and arguably the most terrifying aspect of Creepy.
  Positive
Weve seen dozens of stories of the Maniac Next Door, but Kurosawa finds new depth in the subgenre, largely due to the realism of his filmmaking and the time he takes to tell his story.
  Positive
Theres not much flash in Creepy as the director chooses to ground unimaginable horror by placing it next to a story of an attempt to reclaim domestic bliss.
  Negative
Weve all had times in our lives where we sought to find ourselves again, to make those we love happy, and get over a trauma.
  Negative
Creepy allows us to relate to and like Takakura and Yasuko, and then it drops a bomb, but it doesnt so through a magic video tape or a haunted camera.
  Negative
It does so through someone right next door.
  Positive
Whats creepier than that?
  Neutral
