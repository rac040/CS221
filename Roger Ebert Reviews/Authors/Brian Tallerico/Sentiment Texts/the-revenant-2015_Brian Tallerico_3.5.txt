Great film has the power to convey the unimaginable.
  Positive
We sit in the comfort of a darkened theater or our living room and watch protagonists suffer through physical and emotional pain that most of us cant really comprehend.
  Negative
Too often, these endurance tests feel manipulative or, even worse, false.
  Negative
Were smart enough to see the strings being pulled, and the actor and set never fades away into the character and condition.
  Positive
Whats remarkable about Alejandro Gonzalez Irritus The Revenant is how effectively it transports us to another time and place, while always maintaining its worth as a piece of visual art.
  Very positive
You dont just watch The Revenant, you experience it.
  Positive
You walk out of it exhausted, impressed with the overall quality of the filmmaking and a little more grateful for the creature comforts of your life.
  Positive
Irritu and co-writer  Mark L. Smith set their tone early, staging a breathtaking assault on a group of fur trappers by Native Americans, portrayed not just as enemies but a violent force of nature.
  Negative
While a few dozen men are preparing to pack up and move on to their next stop in the great American wilderness, a scene out of  Apocalypse Now unfolds.
  Positive
Arrows pierce air and flesh as the few surviving men flee to a nearby boat.
  Negative
It turns out that the tribe is seeking a kidnapped daughter of its leader, and will kill anyone who gets in their way.
  Negative
At the same time, we learn that one of the trappers, Hugh Glass  Leonardo DiCaprio has a half-Native American son named Hawk Forrest Goodluck.
  Negative
Low on men and hunted, the expedition leader Andrew Henry  Domhnall Gleeson orders that their crew return to its base, a fort in the middle of this snowy wilderness.
  Negative
John Fitzgerald Tom Hardy disagrees, and the seeds of dissent are planted.
  Negative
He doesnt trust Henry, and he doesnt like Glass.
  Positive
In the midst of these discussions, Glass is away from the crew one day when hes brutally attacked by a bear the sequence is, without hyperbole, one of the most stunning things Ive seen on film in a long time, heart-racing and terrifying.
  Positive
Glass barely survives the attack.
  Negative
It seems highly unlikely that hell make it back to the base.
  Negative
With increasingly dangerous conditions and a tribe of killers on their heels, they agree to split up.
  Negative
Most of the men will go back first while Fitzgerald, Hawk and a young man named Bridger  Will Poulter will get a sizable fee to stay with Glass until he dies, giving him as much comfort as possible in his final days and the burial he deserves.
  Negative
Of course, Fitzgerald quickly tires of having to watch a man he doesnt care about die.
  Negative
He kills Hawk in front of an immobile Glass and then basically buries Hugh alive.
  Negative
As Bridger and Fitzgerald head back, Glass essentially rises from the dead the word revenant means one that returns after death or a long absence and begins his quest for vengeance.
  Negative
With broken bones, no food, and miles to go, he pulls himself through snow and across mountains, seeking the man who killed his son.
  Negative
He is practically a ghost, a man who has come as close to death as one possibly can but is unwilling to go to the other side until justice is done.
  Positive
The bulk of The Revenant consists of this torturous journey, as Glass regains his strength and gets closer to home through sheer force of will.
  Positive
Irritus Oscar-winning cinematographer for  Birdman,  Emmanuel Lubezki who also took a trophy for  Gravity the year before and could easily make it three in a row for this work shoots The Revenant in a way that conveys both the harrowing conditions and the artistry of his vision.
  Negative
The sky seems to go on forever' the horizon is neverending.
  Negative
He works in a color palette provided by nature, and yet enhanced.
  Positive
The snow seems whiter, the sky bluer.
  Negative
Many of his shots, especially in times of great danger like the opening attack and the bear scene, are unbroken   placing us in the middle of the action.
  Positive
At other times, Lubezkis choices recall his work on The Tree of Life, especially in scenes in the second half when Glasss journey gets more mystical.
  Negative
And thats where the film falters a bit.
  Negative
Irritu doesnt quite have a handle on those second-half scenes and the -minute running time begins to feel self-indulgent as the film loses focus.
  Negative
When it centers on the conditions and the tale of a man unwilling to die, its mesmerizing.
  Positive
I just think theres a tighter version, especially in the mid-section, that would be even more effective.
  Negative
About that man: So much has been made of this film being DiCaprios Overdue Oscar shot that I feel like his actual work here will be undervalued.
  Negative
Make no mistake.
  Negative
Should he win, it will not be some Lifetime Achievement win as weve seen in the past for actors who we all thought should have won for another film  Paul Newman,  Al Pacino, etc..
  Negative
Hes completely committed in every terrifying moment, pushing himself further than he ever has before as an actor.
  Positive
Even just the physical demands of this protagonist would have been enough to break a lot of lesser actors, but its the way in which DiCaprio captures his internal fortitude thats captivating his body may be broken, but we believe he is unwilling to give up.
  Positive
The minimal supporting cast is good, and its nice to see Gleeson continue to have an incredible  also in  Brooklyn,  Ex Machina and  Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens.
  Positive
Tom Hardy is less effective, often going a little too heavy on the tics wide eyes, shot up-close, but I think thats a fault of the direction and not one of our best actors.
  Negative
In the end, this is DiCaprios film through and through, and he nails every challenging beat, literally throwing himself into this character that demands more of him physically than any other before.
  Positive
What would you do for vengeance?
  Neutral
What conditions could you surmount to get it?
  Neutral
Or would you just give up?
  Neutral
Our favorite films often drop questions like these into our lives, allowing us to appreciate the world a little differently than before we saw them.
  Very positive
The Revenant has this power.
  Positive
It lingers.
  Neutral
It hangs in the back of your mind like the best classic parables of man vs. nature.
  Positive
It will stay there for quite some time.
