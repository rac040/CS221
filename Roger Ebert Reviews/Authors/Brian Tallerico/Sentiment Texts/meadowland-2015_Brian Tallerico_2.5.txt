Meadowland hinges on an inciting incident so horrifying that its really unfathomable to imagine, even for those of us who have children.
  Negative
Conveying a grief that most people will never have to endure can be a difficult task for a filmmaker, and they often fall back on over-telling such stories, making sure every line of dialogue and every shot selection drips with pain.
  Very negative
Such is the case with  Reed Moranos directorial debut Meadowland, a film with two very strong central performances from a pair of underrated actors that falters by being so self-aware of the tortured existence its attempting to capture.
  Positive
In the end, it feels like Morano didnt trust her actors quite enough to be the conduits of emotion, falling back on too many filmmaking and screenwriting tropes that hamper the realism of their work.
  Negative
Sarah  Olivia Wilde and Phil  Luke Wilson pull over at a gas station in the opening scene of Meadowland.
  Negative
Their son goes into the bathroom and doesnt come out.
  Negative
There was a door in the back of the restroom leading to the garage, the street, and the rest of the world, and hes gone without a trace.
  Negative
As a father of three, even writing that sentence sends chills up my spine.
  Negative
I cant imagine the pain.
  Negative
And Meadowland wastes no time jumping into that bottomless well.
  Negative
This will be a movie about grief.
  Neutral
This will be a movie about suffering.
  Neutral
Meadowland jumps forward a year to reveal Sarah and Phil quietly imploding over the disappearance.
  Positive
They try to go about relatively normal lives Sarah is a teacher, Phil a cop but the lack of resolution seems to be one of the most haunting elements of daily life.
  Positive
They cant even bury their child.
  Negative
And cops come with pictures of children found on the internet or in raids and ask if its their son.
  Neutral
Sarah refuses to even look anymore, while Phil seems to hold out a glimmer of hope that hell be found.
  Negative
Sarah also happens to be a teacher, a far-too-convenient storytelling device for Morano.
  Negative
In an early scene, her students are reading poetry about how your eyes adjust to the dark You dont know when its going to be light again.
  Neutral
It might just keep getting darker.
  Negative
This kind of self-aware scripting pops up again and again in Meadowland.
  Positive
The movie actually works best when Sarah and Phil are silent, as Morano, a cinematographer by trade who also shot this film, captures the gloomy, overcast existence of two people living in misery.
  Positive
The problems lie in Chris Rossis over-explanatory script, which almost seems to be pushing and pulling with Moranos more dreamlike visual style and emotional skill with the actors.
  Negative
Even the structure of Meadowland can be frustrating, as we watch Sarah get closer to a student with Aspergers who is clearly unloved by his parents and bullied at school.
  Negative
The idea that a teacher would be drawn to a surrogate son after losing her own is a fascinating one, but Rossi handles it in a clunky fashion, not really conveying what Sarah thinks shell get out of the relationship.
  Neutral
Similarly, Phil meets a man  John Leguizamo at a support group who has a dark story of his own.
  Negative
Like the Sarah arc, its a narratively frustrating element from the film's too-literal melodrama.
  Negative
Despite those frustrations, Meadowland is ample proof yet again of the underutilized talents of Olivia Wilde and Luke Wilson.
  Negative
Wilde has a way of breaking through the overwritten dialogue to find the truth.
  Negative
Her quiet moments in the classroom, lost in near-suicidal thought, say more about Sarahs arc than any line in the film.
  Negative
Despite her striking beauty, she seems to be folding in on herself, unable to live in the cruel world.
  Negative
She wears a hoodie, acting look like the air hurts her skin.
  Negative
Wilde is great here, and shes matched by Luke Wilson, another actor who seems to be getting more confident and interesting with age.
  Positive
Theyre the reason to see Meadowland, and nearly rescue the piece from the melodramatic swamp into which it eventually sinks.
  Negative
