Cho Ui-seoks Master drops us into what might be considered second-act material for most films, but this epic has  minutes to go and theres no time for set-up.
  Negative
And so we meet Kim Jae-Myung  Dong-won Gang deep into his criminal investigation of power player Jin Hyun-Pil  Byung-hun Lee.
  Neutral
Kim is an audience member for a speech being given by Jin to his most emotional supporters.
  Neutral
Even Jin is moved to tears by the powerful unity hes created through the One Network, one of the most profitable companies in all of Korea.
  Positive
However, as Kim has discovered through his work in the Financial Crimes Unit, Jins empire is built on a pyramid scheme.
  Neutral
While Jin preaches to his choir like a cult leader, Kim plans to take him down.
  Negative
The opening scenes of Master promise an intricate, complex crime thriller a la  Infernal Affairs and  Drug War, and there are glimpses of that kind of movie buried within this often-talky, bloated flick thats more often concerned with money laundering than gunfire.
  Positive
The performances are solid to great throughout, and Cho does build to a remarkably satisfying final twenty minutes, but it takes two hours to get there, and much of those  minutes are weighed down with overdirected scenes of people planning, negotiating, or staring at computer screens.
  Negative
Theres little that's less thrilling than scenes of people hacking furiously.
  Negative
One of those hackers is the fascinating Park Jang-gun  Woo-bin Kim, who Captain Kim takes into custody in the films opening moments.
  Very positive
Park becomes the bridge between Dong-won Gangs  Al Pacino and Byung-hun Lees  Robert De Niro to, use a Heat analogy.
  Negative
As Kim and his team force Park to set Jin up for arrest, this version of Gordon Gekko learns that theres a mole in his operation.
  Negative
The first hour of Master focuses on this dynamic the informant in the system and the way both sides push and pull at the young man, who may have a plan of his own to come out of this disaster as the ultimate winner.
  Negative
It culminates in a fantastic tunnel sequence, full of twists and turns, and something of an ending at the midway point of the film.
  Very positive
Then Master keeps going.
  Neutral
For basically the length of an entire new film.
  Neutral
Without spoilers, the movie sort of resets and Kims operation has to start over again, only with international repercussions.
  Negative
Its almost like two films in a potential franchise were written, the team decided neither movie could stand on their own, and so they were smashed together.
  Negative
It makes for a somewhat exhausting, undeniably repetitive affair.
  Negative
The second hour of the film goes through many of the same motions as the first, and the characters just arent resonant or vibrant enough for us to care.
  Positive
Lee is a great actor and you really should check out his work in The Good, the Bad, and the Weird if you have yet to do so, but hes not given enough to work with here.
  Negative
However, its a testament to his remarkable charisma that he still outshines Gang, whos somehow even more woefully underwritten.
  Neutral
And thats a not-uncommon problem of these thrillers the villain is way more interesting than the cop, leaving us to wonder exactly who we should be rooting for.
  Negative
Perhaps thats why Woo-bin Kim walks away with so much of the movie.
  Positive
While the good cop and the bad businessman are archetypes in which Master cannot find something new to say, Kims man in the middle is pretty fascinating, and this young actor grounds the entire film.
  Positive
Hes easily the most interesting character, the one with shifting morals and an uncertain future.
  Positive
And despite my issues with the bloated midsection of Master, the final twenty minutes almost justify the lengthy journey.
  Negative
Cho finally delivers in these scenes, twisting and turning his plot, while also giving us the car chases and gunfire weve been waiting for.
  Positive
The only question is if youll still be awake by the time he gets there.
  Neutral
