I dont subscribe to the theory that adaptations of artistically successful source material need remain overly faithful.
  Positive
An adaptation, at its best, should also be an interpretation.
  Positive
It should offer a personal take, a new angle, deepening certain themes while naturally reducing others, etc.
  Positive
However, the decisions made when radically altering source material should feel purposeful, not arbitrary and random.
  Neutral
Its not so much when our favorite books are adapted differently that makes fans angry but when they are lessened by the differences.
  Negative
Such is the case with  Adam Wingards depressingly awful Death Note, premiering today on Netflix.
  Negative
Several of the changes to  Tsugumi Ohba and  Takeshi Obatas brilliant manga have already been widely reported, including the whitewashing of the entire project by relocating it from Japan to Seattle, but those are just the symptoms of a greater disease known as complete creative bankruptcy.
  Negative
The concept of Death Note, the manga and at least start of the film, is simple.
  Neutral
A boy named Light Turner  Nat Wolff finds a book dropped to Earth by a Shinigami, a Japanese death demon somewhat akin to the Grim Reaper, named Ryuk, voiced in the film by  Willem Dafoe.
  Negative
The book says Death Note on the cover and has names written in it over centuries.
  Negative
It also has the rules.
  Positive
Write someones name in the book and they will die.
  Negative
In the manga, the rules are extensive and repeated often, but Wingard and writers  Charley Parlapanides amp'  Vlas Parlapanides and  Jeremy Slater understandably simplify things a bit.
  Negative
In the movie, Light writes a name and a manner of death and it unfolds in front of his eyes.
  Negative
That's about all you need to know.
  Neutral
What would you do with that kind of power?
  Neutral
In the manga, Light begins testing his own morality by killing criminals, allowing them to die peacefully of heart attacks as he tests the boundaries of playing God.
  Negative
Perhaps recognizing this wouldnt be thrilling enough for a horror film, the Death Note movie becomes a gorefest almost immediately.
  Negative
Light decides to see if a school bully will truly be decapitated if he writes that on a blank page, and Wingard gleefully stages the ensuing carnage like hes planning to reboot the  Final Destination franchise next.
  Negative
In the film version, Light does move back to justified murder, but even those are Horror Extreme, taking out the man who got away with killing Lights mother and a criminal holding hostages both in brutal ways.
  Negative
The biggest change in the film version of Death Note is the inclusion of a romantic arc with another high school girl named Mia  Margaret Qualley, who is quickly let in on the Angel of Death Game because Light has a crush on her.
  Negative
One couldargue that this character is a version of the manga's Misa Amane, an eventual companion for Light in the books but the character's history and purpose are radically different.And the pair soon get a nemesis in the mysterious L  Keith Stanfield, who tracks the God of Death known in the press as Kira.
  Neutral
One of the best elements of the manga was the cat-and-mouse between KiraLight and L, but thats greatly diffused here by the addition of Mia and the changes made to Lights family, including his police chief father  Shea Whigham.
  Neutral
And heres where we get back to the fatal flaw of Death Note: it doesnt feel like any of these alterations to the source material, and there are many of them, had true artistic or thematic purpose.
  Negative
Why make this or that change?
  Negative
Why add this character or change this plot point?
  Negative
If theres no true answer, its all just a hollow exercise.
  Negative
And the biggest problem is that Wingard and company clearly refused to make Light the antihero he needed to be, and so they add a love interest and pervert the entire concept, leaving the project hollow at its center.
  Negative
Wingard has been a gifted, exciting genre director before with works like  The Guest and Youre Next, but this is misguided in every way.
  Negative
It could be due to years of rewrites of a massive piece of source material, but this movie is a mess on every level, particularly its script.
  Negative
The dialogue truly sucks We could change the world.
  Negative
We?
  Neutral
As in us?
  Neutral
but, worst of all, Wingard and his writers never figured out what to do with Ryuk.
  Very negative
Yes, a spiky demon voiced by Willem Dafoe is actually boring.
  Negative
Ryuk is a great character, a wisecracking demon whos fascinated with the flexible morality of human beings.
  Very positive
The film version doesnt know what to do with him, sidelining him until its time to turn him into a plot point.
  Negative
Even Ryuk himself looks bored.Given the weird bursts of humor and eccentricity in the final project ex., Ls partner-in-crimesolving Watari sings him Optimistic Voices from  The Wizard of Oz to put him to sleep, its stunning how few of them come courtesy of Ryuk.
  Negative
In fact, when the oddity of the L character is injected into the film and, to be fair, Stanfield is, as he often is, the best thing about this project one realizes just how tonally screwed the whole thing is.
  Positive
Most depressingly, given the quality of some of his work even " Blair Witch" has some interesting pieces, the filmmaking here is sporadic, amateurish and haphazard.
  Negative
Wingard verges on black comedy but then pulls back, unsure of what the tone should be of the piece overall.
  Negative
The final scenes are so horrendously constructed and edited that one has to believe the project was rushed or re-shot.
  Negative
And the ending will have you switching off your Netflix app in disgust.
  Negative
If you don't die from boredom before you get there.
  Negative
