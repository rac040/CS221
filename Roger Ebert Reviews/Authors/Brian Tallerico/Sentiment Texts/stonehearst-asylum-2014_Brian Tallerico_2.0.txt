Brad Anderson is one of our most underrated filmmakers, bringing his precise directorial eye to works like Session  and  Transsiberian, while also taking time to elevate shows such as Fringe, The Wire and Boardwalk Empire.
  Positive
When hes working with the right material, Anderson is a craftsman, never wasting a shot or allowing a moment to feel under-considered.
  Positive
Even films that arguably fell apart at some point in the production process like  The Call or Vanishing on  th  Street have been elevated by Andersons involvement.
  Negative
And those interested in genre should seek out his episode of Masters of Horror titled Sounds Like, one of the best in the short-lived Showtime anthology series.
  Positive
My clear admiration for the director amplifies my frustration with his latest.
  Negative
The dread and atmosphere of something like Session  or  The Machinist that should have been a natural fit here is absent.
  Negative
It may not be his worst film overall, but Stonehearst is Andersons flattest film, a disappointingly shallow affair that wastes an opportunity to breathe life into a timeless Edgar Allen Poe short story.
  Very negative
The opening scene of Stonehearst Asylum sets up a film that, sadly, doesnt follow.
  Negative
A young woman named Eliza Graves  Kate Beckinsale is being paraded in front of a room of mental health experts.
  Negative
The doctor in charge  Brendan Gleeson claims that she is mentally ill, however Anderson films the scene in a way that makes the men in the room menacing, teasing a film that should follow about how much energy was expended in medical circles to marginalize what was perceived as a lesser gender.
  Negative
Female sexuality was an illness to be cured.
  Negative
And yet even this opening scene is something of a misdirect.
  Positive
As Gleesons mad doctor says, quoting directly from the Poe story on which this is loosely based, Believe nothing you hear, and only half that you see.
  Negative
The story abruptly shifts to an asylum shrouded in fog.
  Negative
Edward Newgate  Jim Sturgess is the Jonathan Harker of this story, the man coming to the dangerously-lit castle in the middle of the night.
  Negative
Echoes of Bram Stokers Dracula and Shutter Island hang heavy in the air, again promising a film with something to say and personality to spare' setting a table on to which too slight a meal is placed.
  Positive
Newgate is the new doctor at the titular establishment, an asylum for the rich and socially mobile.
  Positive
When the rich and famous dont want to be embarrassed by their uncle who thinks hes a horse, they shuffle him off to Stonehearst.
  Negative
It is where the privileged few go when their minds break.
  Neutral
And it is an unhappy, dark place.
  Negative
As  Ben Kingsleys Silas Lamb says, Misery has a way of clarifying ones condition.
  Negative
As Lamb shows Newgate around the grounds, it becomes clear that something is very, very wrong.
  Negative
Despite all indications that the young man should flee, his new infatuation with Eliza forces him to stay.
  Negative
Hes going to save her' get her free of this torture palace.
  Negative
The male doctor as white knight for the infirm female again, this seems like material ripe for interesting commentary but writer  Joe Gangemi wastes every opportunity to do so.
  Negative
Stonehearst Aslyum becomes something of a tease: every time you think its going to develop into something interesting, it pulls away from you.
  Positive
For a film about insanity and abuse of power, its surprisingly tame.
  Negative
The lack of thematic substance wouldnt be an issue if Stonehearst Asylum had the personality it should have with someone as talented as Anderson at the helm.
  Negative
Stonehearst should be a Hammer film, rich with dark corridors and oppressive shadows.
  Positive
While the production design may be authentic, and one can admire Andersons desire to stay truthful with his period, it leads to a film thats surprisingly dull visually.
  Negative
I like that Anderson doesnt resort to jump scares or other modern horror techniques, but he hasnt replaced those tricks of the trade with the dread required for this story to work.
  Negative
Of course, its not Andersons fault that Gangemis script is shallow and repetitive there has to be at least  scenes of Newgate trying and failing to convince Graves to leave, for example.
  Negative
Theres something more disappointing about seeing great parts that dont cohere into an interesting sum than a film that never could have worked at all.
  Negative
Seeing legends like Kingsley,  Michael Caine and  David Thewlis in a Poe adaptation should have been a genre highlight of the year, and could have really been the film to make Brad Anderson a household name.
  Negative
Time will earn Brad Anderson the praise he deserves.
  Negative
And time will forget this film exists.
