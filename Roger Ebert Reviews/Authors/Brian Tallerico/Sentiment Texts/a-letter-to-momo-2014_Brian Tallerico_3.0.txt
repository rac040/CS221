As is so often the case in Japanese animation, displacement and emotional upheaval lead to interaction with the supernatural in the delicate and effective A Letter to Momo, finally opening stateside today and expanding over the next month after years building buzz on the festival circuit it played TIFF in  and even longer in its detailed, hand-drawn production.
  Positive
Writerdirector  Hiroyuki Okiura last made waves over a decade ago with Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade but this complex, delicate project took seven years to make and a surprisingly long time to work its way through the international film market to U.S. theaters.
  Negative
With the recent announcement that Studio Ghibli may no longer be creating its own films after the retirement of  Hayao Miyazaki and will move on to merely manage its impressive and influential library, fans of this kind of animated storytelling have high hopes for Momo.
  Positive
Those expectations are mostly fulfilled thanks to a deep emotional understanding of grief on Okiuras part and the captivating visuals that accompany the story of a girl who needs some otherworldly help when shes forced to grow up far too quickly.
  Positive
Momo Miyaura is the Alice of this adventure into Wonderland, an -year-old girl forced to relocate with her mother after the passing of her father.
  Negative
Momo and her asthmatic mother move back to moms childhood home, an isolated island named Shio, far from the hustle and bustle of Tokyo in which Momo was raised.
  Negative
Momo doesnt fit in.
  Neutral
Shes too frightened to jump in the water with the other local kids.
  Negative
She clutches the letter from her father that he was planning to write just before he died that says merely, Dear Momo What did he want to say to her in his final moments?
  Negative
Will Momo ever know?
  Neutral
Or will she be able to stop obsessing over past thoughts unexpressed?
  Neutral
Into this emotional upheaval drops three imps from the Above Kawa, Mame and Iwa.
  Negative
Momo is not supposed to be able to see this memorably designed creatures but she can and they become something of a support structure for a girl dealing with the unimaginable grief of losing a parent.
  Negative
She essentially traps them in this world, holding the totem that keeps them here instead of returning to the other side.
  Negative
Giving an -year-old control over passage between this world and the next after something as uncontrollable as a fathers death makes for a beautifully connected film on a spiritual level.
  Positive
Overall, Okiura stays very focused on Momos emotional journey, which is smart.
  Positive
Its not as fantastical as  Spirited Away or many other films about children who encounter the supernatural upon being forced to deal with death, as Momo always stays front and center.
  Positive
The final moments of her journey out of despair are powerfully emotional.
  Positive
In fact, A Letter to Momo is more playful than magical.
  Positive
The differentiation in exaggerated design between the three imps that befriend Momo is remarkably effective and their actions are, as is common with magical creatures in Japanese animation, downright childish at times.
  Positive
Kawa fends off a wild boar with a magical fart in slow-motion' the kind of moment that would probably earn a film like this critical scorn for gross-out humor were it in a DreamWorks film but works in the fabric of this piece overall.
  Negative
They dance, lick Momos leg for attention, eat like slobs theyre designed in such a way that they seem more childish than Momo, which is essential to her journey to adulthood through grief.
  Negative
There are times where one feels the two-hour length of A Letter to Momo, especially in the over-long first act it takes almost half an hour for Momo to interact with the imps that will become the backbone of the story.
  Negative
Even scenes that work, such as a climax on a rain-soaked bridge, feel like they could have been trimmed by a few hand-drawn frames.
  Very negative
Maybe then it wouldnt have taken so long for a film this sweet, delicate, and fun to get to U.S. audiences.
  Positive
