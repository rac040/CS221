How do we process unimaginable betrayal?
  Neutral
How do we overcome the kind of events that forever alter the trajectory of a life we so desperately want back?
  Neutral
These are just two of the questions addressed by Christian Petzolds masterful Phoenix, a film that firmly cements its director as one of the most impressive working today.
  Positive
With echoes of  Vertigo, and a deeply confident visual language, Petzolds film resonates long after its perfect ending.
  Positive
This is a riveting piece of work that never loses sight of its human story while also serving as a commentary for how an entire country deals with tragedies like war.
  Very positive
A film this satisfying on every level one that can be enjoyed purely for its narrative while also providing material for hours of discussion on its themes is truly rare.
  Very positive
Phoenix opens with a face profiled in darkness.
  Neutral
It is the face of Lene  Nina Kunzendorf, a woman driving a bandaged and bloodied passenger back to Berlin.
  Negative
Her face has been badly damaged, but she is a survivor of a concentration camp.
  Negative
After a brief encounter at a checkpoint, the pair drives further and headlights fill the screen before the title comes up.
  Negative
This story will clearly be one of darkness to light, even if its a light that sometimes blinds you.
  Negative
We learn that the passenger is Nelly Lenz Petzolds collaborator,  Nina Hoss, a German-Jewish nightclub singer, who, from the appearance of photographs and discussions with friend Lene, had a happy life.
  Negative
She was married to a handsome, confident man named Johnny another Petzold regular, Ronald Zehrfeld.
  Positive
On October th, Johnny was taken in for questioning by the SS.
  Negative
Two days later, he was released, and Nelly was transported to a concentration camp.
  Positive
Did Johnny betray his wifes Jewish background?
  Neutral
Clearly.
  Neutral
And yet Nelly refuses to believe it.
  Negative
She wants her old life back.
  Positive
And that means denial that her husband was and is a self-serving monster.
  Neutral
After her plastic surgeon advises her that she can look like anyone and start a new life, she tells him, I want to look exactly like I used to.
  Negative
She is defiantly, stubbornly in denial about what has happened to her.
  Negative
Over Lenes objections, Nelly returns to Berlin, seeking out Johnny.
  Negative
She is a shattered woman in a city of rubble.
  Positive
She tells Lene, I no longer exist.
  Positive
The relationship, the friends she now sees only in pictures, even the city she once lived in theyre all gone.
  Positive
She finds some semblance of familiarity in Phoenix, the nightclub that literally looks like an oasis in ruins.
  Negative
Its like a dream that people find amidst the rubble of a bombed-out city.
  Neutral
And thats where she finds Johnny.
  Positive
He grabs her one night.
  Positive
He has a plan.
  Positive
He needs someone to pretend to be his dead wife, so he can claim her inheritance as theres no evidence that his wife is dead.
  Negative
You have to play my wife.
  Neutral
And the parallels between Phoenix and Vertigo come into strong focus as Johnny begins to turn this woman he believes is a stranger into the wife he betrayed, and, in doing so, brings Nelly back to life.
  Positive
Every choice in Phoenix has been carefully considered and yet never in a way that it smothers the realism of the piece.
  Positive
Its a film that has a deep cinematic language that avoids calling attention to its style.
  Positive
Petzolds choices are subtle, from the way he frames the expressive faces of his actors to the choice of Night and Day in a crucial club scene to a climactic conversation that takes place on a train track, so deeply symbolic of looking in one direction to the past and the other to the future as well as carrying historical weight with the trains that took people like Nelly to concentration camps.
  Positive
Dark and light, rising from the ashes, the overhead lighting or neon red of the Phoenix sign Petzold plays so subtly with visual expression of his themes that he doesnt draw attention to them, just allows them to be the background to his human drama.
  Positive
And that human drama is where Nina Hoss takes center stage.
  Negative
Watch the scene in which she takes off her hat in a club after seeing Johnny walk by for the first time.
  Negative
She calls his name, happily, even though she knows what hes done.
  Positive
Its a name shes called so many times before.
  Neutral
He looks past her.
  Neutral
Or maybe he looks at her and doesnt see her.
  Neutral
She cant be there.
  Positive
His brain cant even recognize the possibility that she would be.
  Neutral
Hoss puts her hand to her mouth in horror.
  Neutral
Its not Johnnys betrayal but Johnnys dismissal that hurts her now.
  Negative
This walking embodiment of when things made sense cant see her anymore, and so when he gives her the chance to become Nelly again, she takes it.
  Neutral
At one point, Johnny asks Nelly to help craft a story about what he believes is her false narrative of her time in a concentration camp.
  Negative
Of course, the story Nelly starts to tell is true.
  Positive
Hoss holds her hands to her face, shaky, unable to speak fluidly.
  Negative
And Johnny is equally uncomfortable.
  Negative
The fiction he believes hes creating and the reality theyre both denying are starting to intersect.
  Neutral
Hoss is simply amazing in this scene, and really throughout the film.
  Positive
To be fair, Zehrfeld is very good as well.
  Positive
Watch a moment in which he comes home to find Nelly in the right dress, made-up, and looking more like Nelly of the past.
  Positive
Is that a moment of recognition on his face?
  Neutral
Awareness of what hes done?
  Neutral
No, it cant be.
  Neutral
He cant be that person and she cant be alive.
  Positive
She's a ghost, a reminder of what he's done and what the entire world lost in WWII.
  Negative
If we're lucky, a few times a year we get as complete a package as Phoenix.
  Negative
We get character studies with performances as strong as Hoss and Zehrfeld are here every now and then, or we get auteur-driven films with complex visual choices and an emphasis on style.
  Negative
Its uncommon to see a film so balanced that it serves as a commentary on the human need to deny war and betrayal while never losing sight of the story of a pianist and nightclub singer in  Berlin.
  Negative
Phoenix works on so many levels, it's the kind of piece that can be dissected and appreciated for decades.
  Positive
And I expect it will be.
  Positive
