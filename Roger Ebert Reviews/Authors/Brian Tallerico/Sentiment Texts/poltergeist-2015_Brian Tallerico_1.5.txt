Rarely has a remake felt more contractually obligated than the  version of Poltergeist.
  Negative
There are a few decent performances, a nice riff on the technology fears that drove the original movie, and a centerpiece of horror that works, but never once do you get the feeling that the people behind this remake are here because of artistic passion or creative drive.
  Positive
Theyre here because, well, somebody had to be here, so why not them?
  Negative
With remakes of Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the  th , Evil Dead, and more already on the books, Poltergeist is even arguably a bit late to the party.
  Very negative
And they didnt bring a gift.
  Positive
The Bowen family has fallen on hard times.
  Negative
Eric Sam Rockwell has lost his job at John Deere, forcing them to move to a new home, one which his teenage daughter Kendra  Saxon Sharbino openly mocks.
  Negative
Mother Amy  Rosemarie DeWitt has raised a beautiful family, but may have to go back to a day job to make ends meet.
  Neutral
Son Griffin Kyle Catlett is going through that fearful time of childhood when we hear noises in our closets and wonder whats under the bed.
  Negative
Finally, Madison  Kennedi Clements is a unique little girl, the kind who talks to her imaginary friends a bit too often.
  Negative
Before the Bowens have even unpacked, weird things are afoot in their new abode.
  Negative
Griffin hears sounds in his attic bedroom, and finds a box full of creepy clown toys.
  Negative
He also really doesnt like the look of the old tree nearly scratching his skylight.
  Negative
One night, while Eric and Amy are out to dinner, all Hell quite literally breaks loose.
  Negative
In a pretty effective centerpiece, all three children are attacked separately.
  Negative
Hands popping out of the floor, trees crashing through windows, and those damn clowns its a solid sequence that ends with Madison being taken to the other side.
  Negative
As she fights for survival between worlds, the Bowens have to call in paranormal experts including  Jared Harris and  Jane Adams to save their little girl.
  Negative
Tobe Hoopers Poltergeist had two thematic foundations that have been essentially transferred intact to  Gil Kenans version.
  Negative
It was no mere coincidence that little Carol Ann was sucked into her TV as fears that the idiot box would forever destroy the next generation were pretty common in the early s.
  Negative
In the update, technology is everywhere, and even integrated into the narrative in scenes like the one where Kendra hears something strange through the static on her smartphone and the later use of drone technology.
  Positive
The fear of technology isnt quite developed adequately here nothing is, but I liked how  David Lindsay-Abaire captured the modern world in which we are surrounded by electrical toys the ominous shots of the power lines behind their house are not accidental.
  Positive
Even more importantly, Poltergeist in both forms has a solid answer for the common question that plagues haunted house movies: Why dont they just leave?
  Negative
By the time the Bowens figure out whats going on, one of them is missing, and theyre forced to band together to save her.
  Negative
In many ways, especially in the original, its about a broken family uniting in common cause to save one of their own.
  Negative
That element is strong here thanks in no small part to believable husband-wife chemistry between Rockwell and DeWitt and solid kid performances, especially Catlett.
  Positive
The problem is that neither of these elements feel fresh or new.
  Negative
Nothing about Poltergeist feels fresh or new.
  Positive
And while the mere joy of seeing actors like Rockwell and DeWitt do their thing works for a little while, it cant sustain as the horror narrative intensifies and a few things get decidedly goofy to maintain the PG- rating.
  Negative
By the last act, I really didnt care what happened to the Bowens or those brought in to save them.
  Negative
The stakes dont feel nearly as high here and the thematic undercurrents of the first act have disappeared as the actors and filmmakers go through their motions.
  Negative
Harris is having fun as a reality TV star ghost hunter but he cant fix the screenwriting flaws of a project that inevitably feels like it's just racing to the end, and not in a way that produces any sort of tension.
  Negative
Maybe were a more cynical audience and the films that have copied the original Poltergeist over the years have lessened the impact of the original blueprint so slavishly followed here.
  Negative
If thats the case, Kenan and his team needed to find another reason to update it.
  Negative
Or any reason at all really.
  Neutral
One Final Note: Rarely has D been less essential or felt like more of a cash grab.
  Negative
See it in D if you choose to see it at all.
  Positive
