How do movies like Marauders get made?
  Neutral
One assumes that every film has a creative impetus at some point in its production, but its incredibly hard to find one buried underneath this morally vile, incompetently made thriller.
  Neutral
And so one has to wonder if it wasnt a paycheck gig for everyone involved.
  Negative
Was it merely the business aspect of show business?
  Neutral
Or did director Steven C. Miller set out to make an intense thriller about on-the-edge cops and deadly criminals that would rivet viewers to their seats and justify their ticket or On Demand costs?
  Neutral
Even for how negatively I responded to the bafflingly inept Marauders, I choose to believe that Miller and his overly talented cast didnt just do it for a paycheck.
  Negative
Even with that in mind, its hard to forgive.
  Negative
Marauders opens with a scene straight out of this years Triple , as a series of masked men pull off a complex bank heist.
  Negative
Theyre dressed like the protagonists from the video game Army of Two impersonalterrifying skull masks and bulletproof gear, and theyre highly-coordinated and technologically savvy.
  Positive
They even throw down speakers, so a Siri-esque voice can issue orders instead of the actual attackers ex., Do not hit the alarm or we will kill your manager.
  Negative
They complete the assault, and on the way out they shoot said bank manager point blank with a shotgun.
  Negative
From the beginning, Marauders displays signs of hyperactive, inept filmmaking, the kind that uses shaky cams and quick cuts instead of actual visual compositions.
  Negative
Its angry, loud and annoying.
  Negative
We soon learn that the bank was owned by a high-powered figure named Hubert  Bruce Willis, doing the bare minimum he can to get paid, who hides secrets of political and business leaders in his safety deposit boxes.
  Negative
Of course, the criminals of Marauders have more complex goals than mere accumulation of wealth, which is something that FBI Agent Jonathan Montgomery  Christopher Meloni quickly uncovers, with the help of fellow agents Stockwell  Dave Bautista and Wells  Adrian Grenier, and local cop Mims  Johnathon Schaech.
  Positive
Mims happens to have a wife dying of cancer, which should add to depth to his character but just feels manipulative.
  Negative
Marauders is such a by-the-numbers VOD-cop movie that it becomes depressing.
  Negative
A few scenes of plot furtherance as Montgomery tries to uncover the identity and purpose of the robber-murderers unfold, and then we get another crime, and then a bit more procedural, and then another crime, and then a conclusion.
  Negative
Roll credits.
  Neutral
In between this predictable structure, were given next to nothing to care about.
  Negative
Meloni is an interesting choice for the role that essentially becomes the lead hes an underrated actor who more often gets supporting roles but the writers bestow him almost nothing interesting to play, forcing anger to become his defining trait.
  Negative
Hence, he opens doors like hes mad at them.
  Negative
Grenier looks bored and Bautista gives a supporting part more than it deserves.
  Negative
And then theres the final act, full of revelations and twists designed to shock but just rips gigantic plot holes in the rest of the film, while also forcing it into a morally dubious conclusion.
  Negative
What is the point of Marauders?
  Neutral
One cant take it seriously as social commentary at all, but it tries so hard to include that kind of material that it feels like it wants to be more than dumb fun.
  Negative
Im all for a well-made action film, even of the VOD variety, that delivers the thrills.
  Very positive
But Marauders forgot the fun part.
  Positive
Its just dumb.
  Negative
