Released in the wake of Comic-Con, its impossible not to deeply consider the timing and subtext of a film in which fandom has a major role and  Mark Hamill plays character that shapes that fandom.
  Negative
Such is the undercurrent of Brigsby Bear, the Sundance dramedy that pivots from a dark examination of a life lived in confined culture to a celebration of creativity spawned from that culture.
  Negative
Neither film completely works and the mashing of the two feels incongruent at times but theres a lot to like here, particularly in the daringness of the concept.
  Negative
If anything, I wish that debut director  Dave McCary and the team behind Brigsby Bear had embraced their films oddity a bit more instead of trying to bring it to a more traditionally heartwarming place.
  Positive
Theres a truly subversive film buried in Brigsby Bear the kind of movie that  Michel Gondry or  Charlie Kaufman would have made with the same idea and it shines through just enough to warrant a look but not quite enough to elevate this into the memorable experience it could have been.
  Positive
Theres a mysterious danger to the opening scenes of Brigsby Bear.
  Neutral
A young man named James  Kyle Mooney of Saturday Night Live lives in a room filled with posters, toys, and other collectibles related to his favorite show, Brigsby Bear.
  Negative
The program, which we see him eagerly watching on VHS tapes, looks like a relic of s or s Saturday morning television with low production values, full-frame format, and moral lessons told directly to the screen.
  Very negative
It all looks relatively harmless, except James is way too old to be this obsessed with a kids show, there appears to be little else in his life, and there are no windows in his room.
  Very negative
Something is off.
  Negative
And even the routine over dinner with his parents Hamill amp'  Jane Adams has an air of menace.
  Negative
When we see James and his father venturing out of their underground bunker of a home in gas masks, the assumption is that this is another post-apocalyptic tale the story of a boy devouring the only pop culture left in a world gone mad.
  Negative
Thats not quite it.
  Neutral
We quickly learn that James was kidnapped when he was just an infant, and has been held in this bunker and essentially brainwashed.
  Negative
Taking this dark set-up a step further, James discovers that the show that helped form his worldview was created by his father in a warehouse and that literally no one else has seen it.
  Negative
Even the people he thought he was speaking to on a Brigsby Bear forum were fake.
  Negative
So not only does he enter a real world that he doesnt understand including his real family played well by  Michaela Watkins,  Matt Walsh, and  Ryan Simpkins but he does so without the support of the only thing hes ever known.
  Negative
Imagine being the biggest  Star Wars fan in the world and then being told that you have to go somewhere where no one has ever heard of The Force.
  Negative
It creates a different level of disconnect for James.
  Positive
McCary and his writers Mooney amp'  Kevin Costello arent really interested in that disconnect.
  Negative
Sure, there are a few scenes with a cop played by  Greg Kinnear and a therapist played by  Claire Danes that work James oddity for laughs, but that angle is quickly discarded for a film thats primarily about the power of creativity.
  Neutral
If youre wondering how a film about pop culture obsession and kidnapping becomes an ode to filmmaking, it doesnt quite do so successfully.
  Negative
Brigsby Bear becomes a film about a boy who doesnt overcome his obsession as much as embrace it.
  Negative
Thats a fascinating message as well it is not that our fandom will destroy us but that it will save us but McCary and Mooney dont embrace the stakes of the piece enough for it to register.
  Negative
I wanted more danger, more tension, more drama, and less "James having fun with his new friends."
  Neutral
It often feels as if Brigsby Bear has such an unusual concept that the creators were then scared to lean into it, making everything about its delivery feel like its designed to soften the sharp edges and lighten its darker tones.
  Negative
Brigsby Bear would be a tough tonal balancing act for anyone to pull off, much less a debut filmmaker, and its certainly unlike anything else youll see this year, definitely during blockbuster season.
  Positive
Its the kind of movie thats easy to embrace for its unique subject matter, and hard to hate given how much it emboldens the creative spirit it will make you want to draw, film, write, or create something when its over.
  Very positive
These are the qualities that will make this an important film for people in the way the show-within-a-movie is important for its protagonist.
  Positive
It almost makes a critic who wishes for something more feel as villainous as the shows bad guy, Sun Snatcher.
  Negative
Trust me, I wanted to embrace my inner Brigsby or even the kid within me once and still kinda obsessed with film, comics, games, and television like the loyal travelers to Comic-Con.
  Negative
I just needed more than whimsy to make that cinematic journey to pop culture nirvana.
