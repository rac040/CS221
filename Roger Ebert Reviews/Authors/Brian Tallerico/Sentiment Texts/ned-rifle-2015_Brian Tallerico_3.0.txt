Hal Hartleys often fascinating Ned Rifle feels like a very conscious nod to the films that made its writerdirector famous in the late s and early s while also serving as a commentary on moving on from past successes and failures to face the future head on.
  Positive
It is the work most reminiscent of his quirky, clever character studies like The Unbelievable Truth, Trust and Simple Men in decades, and reminded me why Hartley was so formative on my view of independent cinema in high school.
  Negative
Like those films, Ned Rifle has a jangly, unique energy, as people bounce off each other and then pause to philosophically ask what the bouncing means.
  Positive
Dialogue comes in sporadic bursts, edging on being too self-conscious for the narrative to hold together as often happened in his later films but theres such genuine affection for the characters of Ned Rifle that it never falls apart, even as these people sometimes sound like theyre commenting on other films, filmmakers and the artistic process in general.
  Negative
This is also Hartley at his most loosely hilarious in years, reuniting his favorite actors and finding a new one who seems born for the timing of his comedy.
  Very positive
Ned Rifle, the final chapter in a strange trilogy with  Henry Fool and Fay Grim, is a movie about damaged people coming to terms with their damage by turning to others.
  Negative
And its Hal Hartleys best movie in years.
  Positive
The title character is the son of the title characters from the other two films: Edward Rifle  Liam Aiken, who has been living in witness protection with a very emotionally supportive reverend Hartley regular  Martin Donovan for the last several years while mom was in prison.
  Negative
One very interesting element of Ned Rifle is how Hartley approaches religion without the cynicism or derision often seen in independent cinema.
  Positive
Ned is a deeply religious young man who carries a bible and remains chaste in the face of regular temptation.
  Positive
But Hartley doesnt turn this trait into an object of comedy or isolationism.
  Negative
On the contrary, it seems to ground Ned in a way that the other, free-floating characters lack.
  Negative
Hartleys worldview has always been an open-door one, allowing for different philosophies and trains of thought to run parallel to each other.
  Positive
At the same time that Ned turns old enough to leave his given home, his mother Fay  Parker Posey is being moved to a new prison.
  Positive
He goes to visit her first, before moving on to find his father  Thomas Jay Ryan, with the expressed purpose of killing him for what he did to his mother his God is apparently a vengeful one.
  Negative
To find Henry, Ned first has to track down Simon  James Urbaniak, the poet made famous despite his general allergy to public attention.
  Negative
Simon is holed up in a hotel, trying to figure out his next public move while taking comedy lessons and trying to do stand-up routines online via webcam.
  Negative
The image of a formerly vital artist trying to figure out whats next can quite obviously be read as a bit of self-examination by Hartley, who could be perceived as having lost some of his resonance in the world of independent cinema.
  Negative
When an admirer named Susan  Aubrey Plaza, who has the perfect rhythm for Hartleys dialogue generally stalks her way into Simons world, she reveals that she has done little more than write about him for years, even losing her job as a film critic because every review came back to the poetry of Simon Grim.
  Negative
It turns out that Susan also has a deep connection to Henrys past, and she hooks up with Ned to track him down.
  Positive
With a simple framing style, light score and remarkably short running time, Ned Rifle zips along from beginning to end, which may leave some fans of meatier films like Henry Fool disappointed, but theres an infectious energy that makes this one of Hartleys most likable works.
  Positive
Its also just damn funny and smart.
  Positive
Lines like The good of free will must entail real choices for sin and Youd think a religion would help teach people how the ungodly operate zip by in the clever, dialogue-heavy script at such a fast pace that it almost demands a rewatch to catch all of them.
  Negative
There are little beats like when Fay asks Ned to call her at prison and adds Im always here that made me smile throughout, clearly sensing that Hartley himself was enjoying working in this world one last time.
  Positive
And the final scenes, while a bit rushed narratively, have a surprising emotional resonance.
  Positive
It gives one hope that closing the door on these characters will invigorate Hartley to consistently make great films again.
  Very positive
Ned Rifle reminds me how much I missed him.
  Negative
