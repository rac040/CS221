Earlier this year, GKIDS released a restored version of Studio Ghiblis rarely-seen and masterful  Only Yesterday, and they end the year in a similar fashion, digging into the vaults to present U.S. viewers with an animated drama from one of the most important film companies in history now in limited release in NY.
  Negative
Ocean Waves was broadcast on Japanese television in the early s, but has been hard to find in the United States since then.
  Negative
Reportedly sprung to life as an opportunity for some of the younger animators at Ghibli to spread their wings, Ocean Waves is the first Ghibli film not directed by  Hayao Miyazaki or  Isao Takahata, although one can see the fingerprints of both gentlemen on the final product.
  Negative
With an incredibly short running time  minutes and deceptively simple story, Ocean Waves could feel like a footnote in the Ghibli story but it features qualities of its own as well.
  Positive
Its a delicate, well-told drama that may lack the depth of something like Only Yesterday but proves that Miyazaki and Takahatas students were listening to their teachers.
  Positive
Directed by  Tomomi Mochizuki and written by  Kaori Nakamura from a novel by  Saeko Himuro, Ocean Waves is a story of memory and love.
  Negative
Taku is a young man at a train station in Tokyo when he spots a familiar face on another platform.
  Neutral
Could it be Rikako, the young woman who changed his life in school just a few years prior?
  Negative
The film then flashes back to Takus time in school, focusing on the new girl who shakes everyone up.
  Negative
Taku first spots Rikako through the eyes of his friend Yutaka, who spotted the alluring young woman through a window.
  Negative
Her back is to the window now and so Taku has to take his friends opinion of her as fact.
  Positive
Hes immediately seeing this person through the eyes of his friend, which makes it even harder for him to later admit he has feelings for Rikako, for fear that it will break his friendship with Yutaka.
  Negative
Yes, the people known for masterful fantasies like  Princess Mononoke and  Spirited Away made a love triangle drama.
  Positive
Its an even more gentle and often uneventful film than its description might lead you to believe.
  Negative
Its an episodic tale of encounters between Rikako and Taku.
  Neutral
Theres a school trip to Hawaii during which Rikako loses her money and asks to borrow some.
  Negative
Theres a fateful trip to Tokyo in which Rikako tries to find her father, and Taku ends up tagging along.
  Negative
Theres a lot of slapping.
  Neutral
An argument could be made that if Ocean Waves werent animated and starred three CW stars it would be a dull mess.
  Negative
But its not.
  Neutral
And Ocean Waves is worth watching to see just how much a company like Ghibli can bring to a relatively simple tale.
  Positive
Music is often key in their films it sets a tone and helps guide the audience.
  Positive
Shigeru Nagatas score is constant, sometimes to a distracting degree in the first half, but it becomes a part of the fabric of the piece overall, and the film wouldnt work without it.
  Negative
Of course, the Ghibli team also brings a gentle, graceful visual sense to the film that others wouldnt even consider.
  Positive
Its incredibly subtle here theres no fantastical creature design or world creation to make it obvious but its still there.
  Positive
Its in the character detail, the cuts to shots of nature to link episodic memories, the color choices, and more.
  Positive
In , Studio Ghibli was still a relatively young company.
  Negative
Sure, Miyazaki and Takahata had already dropped a few masterpieces, but the company had several more ahead of them, along with the international fame they would get over the next quarter-century.
  Negative
Ocean Waves may not be a fantastic film on its own Only Yesterday is, for the record but its never dull and helps flesh out the story of a company talented enough to eventually change the world of animation forever.
