What scares you?
  Neutral
Its pretty easy to see what scares James Wan.
  Positive
The directors sense of cinematic fear was clearly formed by the horror films of the s and s, his work often recalling hits of the era like The Omen and Poltergeist.
  Negative
In many ways, The Conjuring  is the ultimate James Wan film, allowing the filmmaker to play with styles of the era in the retelling of one of its most notable paranormal activities: the notorious Enfield poltergeist.
  Positive
Being able to tie the true story behind another horror classic from his youth to this one  The Amityville Horror only sweetens the deal.
  Negative
Wan is a kid in a haunted candy store with The Conjuring  and his talent and that of his team make this kind of ride enjoyable, even if it doesnt have the visceral, confident impact of the original.
  Positive
The Conjuring  opens with notorious ghostbusters Ed  Patrick Wilson and Lorraine Warren  Vera Farmiga investigating the aftermath of the murders that became known as The Amityville Horror.
  Negative
Lorraine has a unique abilityto communicate with supernatural beings and has been asked to confirm that what happened at Amityville was demonic in nature and not just a homicidal patriarch.
  Neutral
While sitting around a table in the DeFeo dining room, Lorraine has an out-of-body experience that allows her to see the shotgun murders that took place in the house and a Demon Nun Bonnie Aarons, which is literally how the recurring vision is listed in the credits, who will haunt Lorraine throughout the film, and issue a warning that Eds days are numbered.
  Negative
After the Amityville prologue, the action jumps to Enfield, England we know were in England because Wan, never a particularly subtle director, uses London Calling on the soundtrack, an obvious choice more playful than annoying.
  Negative
We meet the Hodgson family, led by single mother Peggy Frances OConnor and including four children.
  Negative
One of the girls is Janet  Madison Wolfe, and she starts to have much bigger problems at home than when she was caught smoking by her teacher.
  Negative
It begins with sleepwalking, progresses to sounds in the middle of the night, and ultimately ends up in possession.
  Very negative
A man named Bill Wilkins  Bob Adrian seems to have the ability to take over the poor girls body, even speaking through her, resulting in some infamous recordings in which a young girl sounds decidedly like an old man.
  Negative
And that's nowhere near as scary as the crosses that turn upside down or the visions of the "Crooked Man."
  Negative
The local authorities get in touch with the Warrens, who make the trip to England to determine whether or not the Hodgsons are faking the haunting or stop them from becoming the next Amityville.
  Negative
Children in jeopardy, a put-upon mother, an old house.
  Negative
Sound familiar?
  Neutral
It should.
  Neutral
Wan and his screenwriters very purposefully hit many of the same beats as the first film, presenting us with a set-up that often feels too similar, and disappoints by comparison because OConnors character isnt given nearly the depth of  Lili Taylors in the original.
  Negative
Taylors underrated work in that film helped ground the fear tactics in something real.
  Positive
The characters in The Conjuring  are secondary, introduced with minor definition mom worries about money, one of the boys stutters, etc. and then put-upon enough that the Warrens have to save the day.
  Negative
Despite very solid work by Wolfe to capture the fear of a girl who has no idea whats going on as well as to be truly scary when she needs to be, the characters in The Conjuring  dont resonate, so we dont care as much about what happens to them.
  Negative
Which is not to say that Wan has entirely lost his ability to scare us.
  Negative
Working with ace cinematographer  Don Burgess a regular collaborator of  Robert Zemeckis on everything from  Forrest Gump, for which he won an Oscar, to  Flight, Wan and his team have an incredible ability to produce fear with camera tricks and forced perspective.
  Positive
Theyll start with a shot of a room, zoom in on a face, and then quick-zoom out to reveal something crucial has changed.
  Negative
They avoid traditional, jump-scare edits, knowing that its much scarier to stay in one shot as the normal world becomes terrifying around and in it.
  Negative
And they love playing supernatural POV that floating camera above the action in the house and with what they allow us to see.
  Positive
Theres a fantastic scene in which Janet may or may not be possessed by Bill in the background but Wan and Burgess stay tight on Ed Warrens face, allowing our imaginations to work on whats going on behind him.
  Positive
At its best, Wans incredible camera skills blend with his playfulness the sound of someone or something whistling This Old Man, a fire engine toy moving on its own, a dog bell that every modern horror viewer knows will eventually signal menace to create the kind of thrill ride the director is so clearly trying to replicate.
  Positive
He didnt just make a film set in the s, he employs tricks of the era cinematically, recalling movies like The Omen and  The Shining," but with a modern eye.
  Positive
The Conjuring  doesnt live up to the films that inspired it or the original not because of the filmmaking laziness we so often see in horror especially sequels, but almost because Wan and company are having too much fun to streamline their film.
  Negative
The movie runs amazingly long, and could have lost at least  minutes to make for a tighter, scarier ride.
  Very negative
At times, the non-stop haunting becomes numbing, lessening its ability to scare.
  Negative
The commitment by Wan and his team and Farmiga and Wilson, who completely devote themselves to their sometimes-goofy roles makes the ride worth taking, but "The Conjuring " can be too recognizable to get under our skin.
  Positive
It is an incredibly robust piece of filmmaking on a technical level, and that alone will be enough for many Wan fans and those of us exhausted by Hollywood horror films that often show no filmmaking prowess at all, but ghost stories dont have the same impact the second time you hear them.
  Positive
Even the scary ones.
  Neutral
