Victoria is a breathtaking technical accomplishment.
  Very positive
Its right there in the tagline One City.
  Positive
One Night.
  Neutral
One Take.
  Neutral
For  minutes,  Sebastian Schipper and his cast filmed the entirety of Victoria, reportedly only doing the entire piece a few times and picking the best one.
  Negative
In other words, there are no cheats here.
  Negative
No hidden cuts when a door closes or someone walks by a suspicious wall.
  Negative
It is literally one take, and it takes place all over Berlin, at night, even developing into an intense action movie.
  Positive
Sadly, the second half of Victoria isnt as breathtaking as the first, as characters are forced to make some unbelievably dumb decisions just to fit into the one-take structure, almost leading one to question if there isnt a better version of Victoria that allowed for two or three takes.
  Negative
The best thing about Victoria isnt actually its technical prowess its the lead performance from the mesmerizing  Laia Costa as the title character.
  Very positive
She holds the camera from first frame to last as Schipper doesnt leave her perspective on what will surely be one of the most unforgettable nights of this young womans life.
  Positive
Victoria is on holiday in Berlin.
  Neutral
We meet her clubbing in one of the major city's many hotspots an underground dance hall with no windows.
  Negative
On her way out, likely to another club, Victoria meets a quartet of guys, and they naturally take notice of this vibrant, beautiful young lady.
  Positive
Sonne  Frederick Lau strikes up a flirtation, and the first half of Victoria actually plays more like one of  Richard Linklaters Before movies than one might expect.
  Negative
Victoria and Sonne do a lot of walking and talking, Sebastian Schipper and cinematography Sturla Brandth Grovlens camera circling around this likable pair.
  Negative
Their conversations feel heartfelt and genuine, particularly one in a closed caf at right around the hour mark.
  Positive
And thats where Victoria turns a corner.
  Negative
One of the guys in Sonnes group ends up getting drunk enough to essentially become useless, and we learn that these guys have some unexpected plans for the evening.
  Negative
Rather surprisingly, Victoria becomes a heist film as our quiet protagonist has to become a getaway driver.
  Negative
Schippers camera movements get more hectic, the film gets more impatient, and it essentially turns into an action film.
  Negative
Its interesting to watch how even in a one-take film, form impacts content.
  Positive
Theres no room for editing, but choices are still being made here, as the form often mimics the mood.
  Negative
Its jubilant and fluid in club scenes' panicked and shaky when that reflects the characters state of being.
  Negative
The camera itself becomes a character in Victoria, someone else on the journey of this unforgettable night.
  Negative
It doesnt so much feel like were reflecting Victorias perspective as much as were another member of the party, someone who doesnt want to leave our heroine alone in this dangerous city.
  Negative
Costa is simply perfect here.
  Positive
Watch the way her eyes convey the emotion of the moment, whether or not its in the cautious flirtation with Sonne or the fear of the second act.
  Neutral
Shes often an observer to the insanity of whats going on around her, and she does so much internally, embodying the character in ways that were likely dictated by the form.
  Negative
Shes not allowed the escape of setting up another shot or altering performance over multiple takes.
  Neutral
It makes for a deeply honest, genuine performance.
  Very positive
Sadly, the film kind of lets her down at a certain point.
  Negative
The pace sags significantly at around the -minute mark and never quite recovers from it with  minutes to spare.
  Negative
Like a lot of nights out on the town in major cities in our twenties, it goes on just a bit too long, getting exhausting before its over.
  Negative
And yet its easy to remember and focus on the highlights, which are plentiful for at least the running time of an average movie.
  Positive
If anything, the greatest accomplishment of Victoria is that you stop wondering how it was done and experience the characters and their incredible journey.
  Positive
It becomes less a movie about one take and more a movie about one character.
  Negative
