Filmmaker  Julius Onah is a Nigerian-American who has lived in the Philippines, Nigeria, the United Kingdom, and now calls New York City his home.
  Negative
To say he has a unique socio-cultural perspective to offer the noir genre would be a massive understatement.
  Negative
However, the fact that he injects his remarkably promising debut The Girl is in Trouble with an undercurrent of commentary about class and race isnt the only thing that makes it promising.
  Neutral
Its tightly directed and well-performed, particularly by  Columbus Short and a career-redefining turn from  Wilmer Valderrama.
  Negative
If anything and trust me when I tell you this is the opposite of most independently produced noirs from debut directors theres an overabundance of ideas in The Girl is in Trouble, sometimes to a distracting degree.
  Negative
And Onah doesnt quite stick the landing narratively, although he has such filmmaking energy that his work here merits comparison to that of the films executive producer,  Spike Lee.
  Negative
The most similar film in Lees filmography to this would be Inside Man, a highly underrated, brilliant piece of work in which Lee injected social commentary into what could have been merely another cookie-cutter thriller.
  Negative
Similarly, The Girl is in Trouble looks like just another Wrong Guy, Wrong Girl piece on first glance, but theres much more beneath the surface.
  Negative
Its no accident that the four central characters on which this thriller spins are from four vastly different backgrounds.
  Negative
Theres August Short, a Nigerian-American struggling bartenderDJ, who gets what he thinks is just another booty call from a gorgeous Swede he met at a club named Signe Alicja Bachleda.
  Negative
Its no spoiler to say that Signe is the title character, as earlier that night she happened to be in a closet filming a murder on her cell phone, and shes looking for a place to hide.
  Negative
August wakes up from his night with Signe to find her going through his wallet.
  Neutral
He responds understandably, grabbing her phone to call the police, and, of course, stumbles upon the smartphone version of a snuff film.
  Negative
The victim is a low-level dealer named Jesus Kareem Savinon and the murderer is the son of a powerful financial figure in New York named Nicholas Jesse Spencer.
  Negative
Or is he?
  Neutral
What exactly happened that night?
  Neutral
And can August figure it out before either Nicholas or Jesus crazy brother Angel Wilmer Valderrama finds them?
  Neutral
The characters in The Girl is in Trouble may come from distinctly different backgrounds but Onah unites them in a vision of people trying to grab their part of the American dream, and he does so through the lens of noir.
  Negative
Onah never allows the social commentary to overtake the tension of the narrative, but he also never forgets about it.
  Negative
Its a script that takes diversions for history lessons about immigration, asides about Nicholas not tipping his black server, who happened to be August.
  Negative
A memory of August being arrested three years ago for punching a yuppie who flicked a cigarette at him.
  Neutral
The fact that hes too broke to see a doctor.
  Negative
Its a film about people not just looking for money, but a place in this world, and Onah is careful to mark what they have in common as much as how theyre different its no coincidence that music plays a major part in the lives of August, Signe, and Nicholas.
  Negative
One can feel Lees touch at different times throughout The Girl is in Trouble as Onah even cribs the trademark dolly shot in which his protagonists look like theyre floating and he does so effectively given the themes of people detached, looking for solid ground.
  Very positive
Onah also deserves credit for really paying off the big moment the flashback to the night of the murder.
  Negative
Its perfectly blocked, timed, and edited to produce maximum tension.
  Positive
We seem to rush too quickly from that memory to the credits, but thats a minor complaint.
  Negative
Cast is uniformly strong here, especially Short, who makes a likable leading man, and a surprisingly malevolent turn from Valderrama, an actor not really known for playing villains.
  Positive
Hes believably menacing to the point that you forget that this is casting against type after only a couple minutes.
  Negative
And he smartly imbues Angel with a sense of sadness at what he feels he has to do to avenge his brother.
  Positive
Like so many of these people, the predicaments of their life whether its Signes drama, Nicholas Bernie Madoff-esque criminal father, or Augusts job troubles are not ones they have chosen.
  Negative
Although the end of The Girl is in Trouble spins even that on its head, arguing that responsibility and owning your life is the key to happiness.
  Positive
You dont really find a place in this world, no matter where you come from, until you choose to take it.
  Negative
