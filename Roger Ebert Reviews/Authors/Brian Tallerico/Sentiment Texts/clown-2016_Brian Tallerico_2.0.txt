Jon Watts made waves at the  Sundance Film Festival with his throwback thriller  Cop Car getting enough attention that he was given a Golden Ticket to join Club MCU by directing s Spider-Man: Homecoming.
  Negative
Interestingly, Watts had another film in the can that had never been released, s Clown, produced by  Eli Roth, and just this week is getting a small theatrical and VOD release.
  Negative
Why was Clown buried?
  Negative
Is it an example of a film that is only being seen because of its creators subsequent fame and should have been left in a shallow cinema grave?
  Negative
Or is it evidence of the talent that Watts would later show on a larger stage?
  Neutral
The answer is somewhere in between.
  Neutral
While Clown is far from the disastrous misfire that typically stains VOD horror movies most range from awful to I never want to see a movie again, it comes apart about halfway through, losing a very difficult tonal balance.
  Negative
Having said that, theres more to like here than the studio burial would have you believe.
  Negative
Its actually most likely that the studio is semi-burying Clown and didn't screen it for critics because theyre a little scared of it.
  Negative
While its not as all-out gory as some of the films also produced by Eli Roth, it hinges on a no-no even in horror cinema the violent, bloody, sometimes cannibalistic death of children.
  Negative
Horror fans will watch adults, especially morally corrupt ones, get drawn and quartered, but putting kids in jeopardy is generally considered a bridge too far.
  Negative
Seeing kids eaten by a killer clown?
  Neutral
Kind of hard to put into a trailer.
  Positive
Long before hes devouring rugrats, Kent  Andy Powers is an average family man.
  Negative
When a clown doesnt show up for his sons birthday party, he finds an old suit in a house hes trying to sell in his role as a realtor.
  Negative
The party goes off without a hitch but he falls asleep on the couch in his full clown gear.
  Negative
The next day, he notices that the red rubber nose wont come off and the wig seems to have fused with his real hair.
  Negative
When he tries to get the suit off, even with a handsaw, he fails.
  Negative
As if spending the rest of your life looking like a vagabond Ronald McDonald isnt bad enough, Kent notices that he has an new taste for the blood of children.
  Negative
A man  Peter Stormare, in full Stormare Mode with a history with the clown suit tells Kent and his wife an ineffective  Laura Allen that decapitation is the only answer before the demon in the suit takes over Kent completely.
  Negative
The first act of Clown works because it lays a lot of its arc at the feet of a totally-committed performance by Powers.
  Positive
To pull off the story of a man who cant get out of a clown suit requires  Nicolas Cage in Vampires Kiss levels of commitment and Powers is completely in for the ride.
  Negative
Watts tone is also playful in this first act, such as when Kent tries to blow his brains out and ends up with a rainbow spray on the wall.
  Negative
Spoiler: It doesnt work.
  Positive
The problem with Clown is that it eventually tries to get serious and loses its way in two key places.
  Negative
First, theres kind of a gross scene in which a bully gets his comeuppance in a most grotesque way that doesnt work tonally and when kid death doesnt work tonally, it really doesnt work.
  Negative
More long-term, the final act basically turns Kent into a child-eating demon, taking Powers out of the film as an actor and forcing Allen to do a lot of heavy emoting to try and save her husband.
  Negative
Its around here that one starts adding up the films missed opportunities as well.
  Negative
It doesnt really provide any truly frightening scary clown imagery to add to that crowded subgenre and it takes no opportunities to become something deeper in terms of commentary on fatherhood, masculinity, even childhood icons, etc.
  Negative
Its really just a killer clown movie.
  Negative
One has to give Watts and Powers credit for really going for it and not pulling back from their disturbing concept, but that credit runs out before the movie is over.
