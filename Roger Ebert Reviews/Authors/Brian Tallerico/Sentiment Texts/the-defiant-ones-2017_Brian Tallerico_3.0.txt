If you sent only the music of  Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre into outer space, alien cultures would still have a pretty good picture of the American industry over the last four decades.
  Positive
Premiering this Sunday on HBO, and then airing over the next three nights, The Defiant Ones covers the arc of both men, devoting the first two episodes of four to their careers before they met and the second two to how music changed when they united their formidable talents.
  Negative
The documentary, directed and co-written by  Allen Hughes, has elements of fan service negative aspects of either gentlemans personal or professional lives often feel rushed but it makes the case that this pair deserves carving on the Mt. Rushmore of the music industry.
  Negative
And while the documentary falls into the trap of a talking-head structure, these are some damn impressive heads.
  Positive
Basically, everyone that Iovine and Dre have worked with over the years appears to discuss their legacy and importance to the industry.
  Negative
Pay attention, Earthlings.
  Positive
Hughes was not only granted access to Iovine and Dre over a three-year period, he assembled a Hall of Fame list of interview subjects to discuss working with the men.
  Negative
The result is a project that feels like it has weight instead of merely a fan letter to a couple legends.
  Negative
Rock icons like  Bruce Springsteen,  Tom Petty, Bono,  Patti Smith and Stevie Nicks discuss their collaborations with Iovine' rap masters like  Ice Cube,  Snoop Dogg, Eminem and Kendrick Lamar pay homage to Dre.
  Very negative
And all of them have interesting stories to tell.
  Positive
In a sense, The Defiant Ones is a four-hour Hall of Fame presentation, making clear how much Iovine and Dre have not just been a part of the industry but shaped it and changed it forever.
  Negative
Personally, I love anecdotes that illustrate the ripple effect of creativity.
  Positive
How does Born to Run lead to Because the Night, which leads to Refugee?
  Neutral
How did Rico Suave change the music industry?
  Neutral
Did a paintball gun really inspire Fuck the Police?
  Negative
How did the rap industry survive the death of Tupac?
  Neutral
What happened after streaming music became the norm?
  Neutral
Stories about the first time that Dre heard Snoop Dogg or his first meeting with Eminem are simply the kind of thing I love hearing theres something about those seemingly fateful moments in music history that make for good television, especially for those of us old enough to have seen all of this take place.
  Positive
There are times when the chronological format that jumps from Iovine to Dre even before they knew each other feels like it hampers the piece.
  Negative
In one case, the show jumps from the car accident that destroyed the voice of The D.O.C. of N.W.A. fame back to the relationship status between Iovine and Nicks and I almost got whiplash.
  Negative
And while the show doesnt shy away from the dark chapters of their lives in one of the most interesting, Dee Barnes discusses the assault on her by Dre, and he admits to considering it a blemish on who he is as a man it always moves quickly back to success.
  Negative
In the fourth chapter, Iovine discusses how horses have to have blinders on so they dont see the competition, suggesting that successful people need to do the same.
  Positive
The Defiant Ones follows this model as well, never even mentioning an act that Iovine or Dre didnt work with, when it would have been nice to give the gentlemen some context within the bigger picture of the music industry.
  Negative
And the production can sometimes get a little overheated, never more so than in in a segment that parallels the controversies between  Tupac Shakur and  Marilyn Manson in a way that feels forced.
  Negative
The Defiant Ones stumbles most in the final half-hour, which often feels like a commercial for Beats headphones, the latest mega-success for Iovine and Dre.
  Negative
Although, by that point, I didnt really care because I had heard so many interesting stories over the previous three-and-a-half episodes.
  Negative
Most of all, I was allowed insight into two men who lived up to the adjective in the title of this show.
  Negative
Every time, Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre were told something wouldnt work or they couldnt do something, they defied traditional thinking about the music industry, and changed it forever.
  Negative
Theyre not just producers.
  Neutral
Theyre not just businessmen.
  Neutral
They didnt just follow the current, they changed the flow of the stream.
  Negative
It's a reminder that our true visionaries dont follow a template' they make a new one.
