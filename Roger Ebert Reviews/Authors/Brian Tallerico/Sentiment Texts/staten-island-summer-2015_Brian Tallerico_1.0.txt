Following the success of Waynes World, the s saw a wave of Saturday Night Live sketches turned into feature films that are best forgotten, including Its Pat,  The Ladies Man,  Superstar and A Night at the Roxbury.
  Negative
The films were exercises in laziness, features built on the concept that the only thing one needed to in order to stretch a -minute sketch into a -minute movie was to repeat the same jokes and often catch phrases about  times.
  Negative
The comedies were particularly frustrating because one could sense the pure comic talent of people like  Will Ferrell and  Molly Shannon, and so were disappointed when they were wasted on such junk.
  Negative
The trend died out, and we can all be grateful we didnt have to suffer through The Target Lady or The Californians although Id donate to a Stefon movie Kickstarter.
  Negative
All of this makes Staten Island Summer, now open in select theaters and available Digital platforms before appearing on Netflix this Thursday, July th, feel like even more of an anachronism.
  Negative
They dont make movies that seem to purposefully waste the talents of current SNL stars much any more.
  Negative
Well, except for this one.
  Negative
To be fair, the SNL cast here is supporting and not lead, but they are the draw, especially after one spends five minutes with the actual leads of Staten Island Summer, and realizes they are merely mediocre riffs on the characters that  Michael Cera and  Jonah Hill played so memorably in  Superbad.
  Negative
The likable but dull  Graham Phillips plays the likable but dull Danny Campbell as he narrates the story of the most important summer of his life, which takes place almost entirely at the public pool at which he is a lifeguard.
  Negative
Danny and his best buddy Frank the remarkably annoying  Zack Pearlman need to have one last Summer blast before they head into adulthood, and so this years annual after hour pool party is of the utmost importance.
  Negative
Will Frank hook up with one of the gorgeous twins Katie and Kellie Cockrell who have ignored him all Summer?
  Neutral
Will Danny finally get close to the legendary Krystal Manicucci Ashley Greene, his first crush?
  Neutral
Around the fringe of this riff on  American Pie and Superbad lay the SNL cast members, past and present, all seemingly doing Weekend Update host  Colin Jost a favor Jost wrote the clearly semi-biographical piece and has a small part as a rambunctious cop.
  Negative
Cecily Strong,  Will Forte,  Fred Armisen, Bobby Moynihan and the Emmy-nominated  Kate McKinnon are all, to varying degrees, wasted.
  Negative
Strong has the biggest role as the toughest talker on the lifeguard staff, although her character is ultimately, of course, reduced to a love interest for another bro.
  Negative
Moynihan and Armisen fare reasonably well as the stoner lifeguard and slightly-unhinged groundskeeper, respectively.
  Negative
McKinnon is totally wasted, and other familiar faces like  Kate Walsh,  Jim Gaffigan, Gina Gershon,  Vincent Pastore and even  Method Man pop up to make one wonder what attracted so many people to so little.
  Very negative
None of them are particularly bad here but theyve been given almost nothing to do.
  Negative
They dont play realistic characters, they dont tell jokes' theyre just kind of there.
  Negative
The result is a weird exercise in which you play a game of recognizing performers instead of actually giving a damn about what theyre doing in the actual movie.
  Negative
Perhaps it was little more than the promise to hang out together around a pool for a few weeks.
  Neutral
It certainly seems that way given the lack of actual writing and joke-crafting going on here.
  Negative
Jost cant figure out the movie he wanted to make.
  Negative
Staten Island Summer starts as a nostalgia piece, even promising a bit of dramedy a la The Way Way Back.
  Positive
And yet theres absolutely no depth to the piece whatsoever, largely in part because were never given one reason to care about Danny.
  Negative
Sure, he seems nice, but literally everyone around him is simply more interesting.
  Positive
Staten Island Summer is one of those films in which virtually every time a supporting character leaves, you wish you could go with him or her.
  Negative
Except for Frank, a walking and talking clich of the horny teenager.
  Neutral
We were all teenagers once.
  Neutral
Most of us have that formative summer upon which we can look back and fondly remember the people with whom we spent it.
  Neutral
So Colin Jost wanted to bring his friends along to recreate his personal summer memories.
  Neutral
Someone should have told him, perhaps someone who worked on those s SNL movies, that you can never go back again.
  Negative
