Sports and music have a lot in common.
  Neutral
They both produce rabid fandom, the kind in which people camp out in line for days to get tickets to a major sporting event or the best position for a general admission rock concert.
  Negative
They both invoke a feeling of community people channeling the same passion and fandom at an event like the World Series or the two-night concert held last August by  Pearl Jam at Wrigley Field.
  Positive
Both are the subject of Lets Play Two, a quasi-concert film about the PJ shows at Wrigley that spends just as much time on the history of the Chicago Cubs and their remarkable  season, which culminated in their first World Series win since most of the country developed electricity.
  Positive
The film is a bit formless and goes on way too long, but if youre in that Venn Diagram crossover that includes both Cubs fandom and allegiance to Eddie Vedders band, you owe it to yourself to see the film.
  Negative
It is a fan letter to both the Cubbies and one of the biggest rock bands in the world andthe passion behind its creation, along with the passion of its frontman, allow one to look past its flaws with relative ease.
  Very positive
A declaration of personal fandom feels appropriate here.
  Positive
I am of the perfect age for Pearl Jam fandom, being a teenager when Ten came out, and I tracked the band loyally for years, although more fervently in my youth.
  Negative
I can still remember searching for concert bootlegs and rare import singles of the group, so I was sure I heard everything they recorded.
  Positive
Istill listen to them on occasion even today.
  Negative
As for the Cubs, Im a Detroit transplant and stay loyal to the Tigers, but Ive lived in Chicago for decades, most of it on the northside, and it was impossible not to get swept away in the city-wide joy produced by last years team.
  Negative
It was historic.
  Neutral
Eddie Vedder understood that history.
  Neutral
He is also a lifelong Cubs fan, and tells stories in Lets Play Two about the years when most of the city didnt pay attention to what was happening at Wrigley Field.
  Positive
His favorite player growing up was Jose Cardenal and there would be so few people at games that he could play hide and seek in the upper deck when he was a kid.
  Positive
Lets Play Two intercuts stories like this, about Eddies fandom and the  season, with concert footage from their two nights at Wrigley.
  Positive
So, we get a couple songs, including an incredible version of Better Man early, and then hear some anecdotes about the Cubs and the power of the place in which the band is playing, cut together with a look at the  postseason.
  Positive
It creates a different atmosphere than a traditional concert film, in which the venue often doesnt really matter.
  Positive
Here, the venue is holy, and Eddie is a guest preacher in the church of baseball.
  Negative
We even travel with Eddie and the filmmakers to the historic places around Wrigley Field, spending a great deal of time at Murphys Bleachers and even speaking to the owner of the famous concert venue, theMetro.
  Negative
And we get a lot of time with Theo Epstein, the mastermind behind the Cubs victory.
  Negative
Interestingly, and somewhat disappointingly, we get no time with Joe Maddon or the Cubs players, some of whom have to be Pearl Jam fans.
  Negative
Epstein says early that theyre four games from the World Series during one of his interviews, so Im guessing the team had other concerns then, but they could have gone back for pick-ups.
  Negative
For what its worth, Epstein is a great interview, grasping the importance of the  season not only to the city but to his friend Eddie.
  Positive
Lets Play Two loses some of its way at about the hour mark, when it dives into the history of the band, including some archival footage of them playing the Metro for the first time, opening for Soul Asylum  years ago and making  for the gig.
  Negative
Its a two-hour documentary, and the second hour should have focused entirely on the concert, allowing it to build as we intercut with the building Cubs season.
  Positive
Diversions to Jeff Aments favorite bass players are fine for hardcore fans but dont work over an hour into this particular movie.
  Positive
And the concert footage in the second half is so strong including great versions of  Inside Job, Crazy Mary, and Release that one just wants more of it.
  Positive
In the end, Lets Play Two is a movie about fans of the Chicago Cubs and Pearl Jam, asmade by fans of the Chicago Cubs and Pearl Jam.
  Negative
If you fall into neither group, its not creatively constructed enough to justify its running time for you.
  Negative
If you fall into both groups, it probably couldnt be long enough.
  Negative
