Anger is an energy in  Martin McDonaghs brilliant Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, one of the best films of the year.
  Very positive
In this Southern American with an Irish attitude story from the " In Bruges" writerdirector that, like a lot of his work, recalls Flannery OConnor in tone the  O'Connor quote "The truth does not change according to our ability to stomach it" could be this movie's tagline, anger is not treated like something to be cured.
  Negative
Hollywood likes to teach us that anger is a sin, and that only through acceptance and understanding can we find true happiness.
  Negative
Easier said than done, right?
  Neutral
How can you not be angry at an unfair world?
  Neutral
Life will take children before parents.
  Neutral
Life will give cancer to relatively young people.
  Neutral
Life will be racist, sexist, and cruel.
  Negative
And you should throw a few back and yell at something that unfair.
  Negative
You should fight.
  Neutral
It is only through that fighting and that rage that other emotions like empathy and understanding can surface.
  Negative
Anger is not a disease to be cured but a path on the road to comprehending the world.
  Negative
No one does angry better than  Frances McDormand, who does her best film work here since  Fargo as Mildred Hayes, a recently divorced mother who lost her daughter Angela less than a year ago.
  Negative
Angela was raped and murdered, but the case has gone cold.
  Negative
There was no matching DNA, so the spotlight has dimmed and Mildred is getting no updates.
  Negative
Shes angry.
  Negative
She should be.
  Positive
One day, she sees three barren billboards on a rarely-traveled road, and she rents the space to ask the local chief of police, played by  Woody Harrelson, why there are no answers.
  Positive
Local media becomes interested in the billboards, and the attention sparks a series of events involving not only the chief but one of his more loathsome officers, played by  Sam Rockwell.
  Negative
Peter Dinklage,  Caleb Landry Jones,  Abbie Cornish,  Lucas Hedges,  Clarke Peters, and  John Hawkes fill out a ridiculously perfect supporting cast.
  Very negative
You might think you have your finger on what this will be like from that description, but McDonaghs simply perfect script is never quite what you expect it to be.
  Neutral
The mystery of what happened to Angela would have dominated other versions of this story, but this is not really that movie.
  Negative
On one level, it is more about cause and effect than crime and resolution.
  Neutral
Mildred rents the billboards, which leads to pressure on the chief, which leads to anger from his loyal officer, and so on and so on down the line.
  Negative
McDonagh spares no one, allowing almost all of his characters to be deeply flawed, especially McDormands Mildred and Rockwells Dixon.
  Negative
Life has screwed over both of these people, and it has made them both angry.
  Positive
Mildred is channeling her anger to solve her daughters murder.
  Negative
Dixon has less of an idea of what to do with his, but one senses early on that its probably going to eventually cost him his job.
  Negative
Rockwell often plays nice guys, but hes more effective here as a racist, violent cop than you might expect.
  Negative
He looks older and pudgier, like he drinks himself to sleep every night and doesnt really trust that life has much in store for him.
  Negative
Rockwell has a big arc in this film and he takes no false steps, as usual.
  Negative
Harrelson is great too, but the film belongs to McDormand, who can do more with a withering glare than most actresses can do with a monologue.
  Positive
She is simply stunning when it comes to internal language, so often revealing the pain underneath the rage.
  Positive
Her Mildred takes no prisoners, but also feels like someone literally torn apart inside by grief.
  Negative
McDormand can destroy a monologue, too a scene with a priest offering counsel is an all-timer, earning applause at my screening but shes even more impressive in the minor beats.
  Negative
Its the curl of a lip to fight back tears or the downward glance to stop herself from punching someone.
  Negative
This character is so completely, fully realized in ways that other actresses couldnt have come anywhere close to capturing.
  Positive
Its stunning to watch.
  Very positive
Of course, McDonagh deserves a ton of credit for not only directing her but giving her such a great part in such a smart script.
  Positive
Empathy and peace with the too-common injustice of our world is a common theme in cinema, but its usually handled with kid gloves or pat resolutions.
  Positive
There are no easy answers in McDonaghs world no clear-cut heroes and villains.
  Negative
You will start to question Mildred and you will start to defend Dixon.
  Positive
In a sense, thats one of McDonaghs most stunning tricks with this film.
  Positive
The world is more complex than most movies would have you think, and it takes a writer of his remarkable ability to convey that.
  Positive
Hes also operating at a more technically accomplished level than ever before, particularly in the way the film uses a great score from Coen regular  Carter Burwell and well-balanced cinematography from  Ben Davis.
  Positive
Not every speedbump given us by life teaches us tolerance.
  Negative
A daughter shouldnt die at all, much less brutally.
  Negative
But what do we do with that knowledge?
  Neutral
How do we channel our anger at an unjust world?
  Neutral
Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is one of those truly rare films that feels both profound and grounded' inspirational without ever manipulatively trying to be so.
  Positive
Very few recent movies have made me laugh and cry in equal measure as much as this one.
  Positive
Very few films recently are this good.
