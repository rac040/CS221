Takashi Miike is the fearless samurai of filmmaking, releasing his thfilm this week in his adaptation of Hiroaki Samuras Blade of the Immortal.
  Neutral
As a rebellious pioneer of cinema, his status may have lessened a bit internationally since the heyday of "Ichi the Killer" and "Audition,"but he has lost none of his craftsmans skill, as evidenced in every frame of this gorgeous, epic tale of endless carnage.
  Negative
Blade of the Immortal feels like a film that could only be made by someone with a long career in film and a lot of life experience to bring to it.
  Positive
In a sense, it is about a man going through routine after routine, trudging forward through a life he no longer wants to live.
  Negative
Of course, Im not suggesting Miike is sick of filmmaking if anything, the cinematic energy here proves otherwise but that Blade of the Immortal required the hand of an experienced director, and they dont get much more experienced than Miike.
  Negative
Blade of the Immortal tells the story of Manji  Takuya Kimura, a samurai who is blessedcursed with immortality.
  Negative
He has had generations to mourn the loss of the only person he cared about and lament the code of honor he can no longer follow.
  Negative
He is not an immortal in the superhero sense of the word, but an immortal in the way that we often see ghosts represented in fiction as people forced to stay on Earth and forever regret their sins.
  Negative
Of course, Manji gets a final chance to matter to someone when hes found by a girl named Rin Asano  Hana Sugisaki after her parents are killed by group of assassins who are trying to change the way of the samurai.
  Positive
That final phrase is key to the narrative of Blade of the Immortal.
  Neutral
Kagehisa Anotsu the nearly movie-stealing  Sota Fukushi, the man who leads the assassins who killed Rins father, comes from a different school of swordplay and represents a darker, more violent future for the samurai warrior.
  Negative
Forms of combat become a major current in Blade of the Immortal, especially as more and more styles come into play and politics between rival schools become important.
  Negative
Manji is a practitioner of a lost art and style, which again feels like something only a man who has made  films could adequately convey.
  Negative
Of course, Blade of the Immortal isnt all about codes and politics its mostly about blood and guts.
  Neutral
This is Miike closer to his gonzo violent style of the 's and 's than he's been in a long time.Owing a great deal to the fact that this is based on a manga that ran for  volumes, Blade of the Immortal is remarkably episodic.
  Neutral
It basically breaks down to a series of one-on-one fights between Manji and, for at least the first hour, members of Anotsus team of assassins.
  Negative
They are wildly exaggerated affairs, complete with supernatural powers and wire-based combat and geysers of blood.
  Negative
They are often breathtaking fight sequences, as Miike finds ways to make these one-on-one affairs distinctly unforgettable.
  Very positive
Theres the man who shares a key trait with Manji' another who cries remorseful tears after she kills' one who looks like a walking nightmare with human body parts strapped to his own and Miike accelerates the combat in Blade of the Immortal to the inevitable multi-enemy battle that includes literally rivers of blood.
  Negative
Hundreds of people die in Blade of the Immortal, most of them losing a limb or two as they do.
  Negative
For pure samurai action, it's a must-see.
  Positive
On the other hand, over the course of two-and-a-half hours, even a fan'ssamurai patience can be tested.
  Negative
It doesnt help that the story of  Blade gets a little cluttered, introducing new enemies and potential allies at a point when you wish it would be wrapping up instead of starting down another road.
  Negative
And Kimuras performance starts to feel thinner than it should, not merely by repetition but by the actor being outperformed by some of his co-stars.
  Negative
He lacks the true charisma to ground this film in the way it needed to sustain interest for its admittedly overlong running time.
  Negative
Having said that, theres still something about the -year-old Miike working in this register  films into his career.
  Negative
There are enough flashes of brilliance through all  minutes of Blade of the Immortal that its sins can be easily forgiven.
  Positive
And its that balance of Miikes experience with his retained childlike energy in making a kick-ass samurai movie that keeps this journey engaging.
  Positive
It feels like a film that no one else would have made in quite the same way as Takashi Miike.
  Negative
I hope he makes at least  more.
  Positive
