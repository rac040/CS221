PTSD is a real, national crisis.
  Negative
It is something that is not openly discussed enough nor adequately handled by our government and those in charge of taking care of our veterans.
  Negative
The number of homeless vets and those suffering from PTSD in silence should be a priority for a country that wants to call itself civilized.
  Negative
None of these facts make  Dito Montiels Man Down a good film.
  Negative
Actually, the fact that it uses PTSD as a hook, as something to give its drama a sense of weight and importance that it doesnt otherwise earn, is one of its many problems.
  Negative
If youre going to make a film about PTSD, treat it with the respect it demands, not as a clichd, melodramatic device.
  Positive
By doing so, one actually damages the cause they claim to be attempting to defend, turning something serious into something manipulative.
  Negative
Man Down is a bad film, but its made even worse by the taste it will leave in your mouth regarding its silly handling of a very serious issue.
  Very negative
Montiel's latest takes place in what appears to be four separate periods in the life of Marine Gabriel Drummer  Shia LaBeouf.
  Negative
We see him with his buddy Devin  Jai Courtney in a post-apocalyptic future, as the pair tries to track down Gabriels son Johnathan  Charlie Shotwell, crossing paths with a drifter named Charles Clifton Collins Jr., who may know where the boy has been taken.
  Negative
The landscape they cross is desolate and empty.
  Negative
Where are they?
  Neutral
What happened to Johnathan?
  Neutral
What happened to everyone else?
  Neutral
It's purposefully vague and confusing.
  Negative
We flash back to basic training, featuring scenes so dense with military clichs they should have all been set to Fortunate Son.
  Negative
Working slightly better as drama, we experience an extended conversation between Gabriel and a superior, played by  Gary Oldman, that seems to take place after the young man has become a Marine but before the world ends.
  Positive
This scene as a whole is far and away the film's best as it escapes the plot and allows the two actors some semblance of character.
  Positive
Without it, the movie would verge on unbearable.
  Negative
And then we flash back further to Gabriels life just before joining up, in which we meet his wife Natalie  Kate Mara and enrich the bond between Gabriel and his son.
  Negative
The haphazard, choppy editing of Man Down is designed in such a way to replicate the confusion and twisted reality associated with PTSD, but its effect is opposite in that it feels entirely like cheap, manipulative devices instead of anything insightful about the human condition.
  Very negative
Man Down is one of those scripts that plays games with viewer awareness, forcing us to ask whats real and whats not, and keeping a mystery what happened to Gabriels son or while he was serving our country.
  Negative
Consequently, there are no real people in Man Down.
  Negative
There are no characters.
  Negative
There are merely cogs in the plot device machine.
  Negative
The sad thing is that LaBeouf does admirable work to try to correct for the lack of depth in  Adam G. Simon and Montiels script.
  Positive
He commits to the role completely, never betraying the films shallowness or clichs, and trying his best to find something worthwhile in terms of character.
  Positive
He makes some decisions in the extended scene with Oldman that totally work.
  Negative
He looks like a broken man, cracking from the inside out.
  Negative
Theres a good LaBeouf performance buried deep in this film, and it almost makes the clichs around it more frustrating because of the honest work they smother.
  Positive
Montiel has proven himself an interesting filmmaker when it comes to analyzing the alpha male in films like A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints and  Fighting, but he never figures out the right approach for "Man Down."
  Positive
At times, the dialogue is so clichd This areas secure.
  Negative
Were at war, Marine.
  Neutral
Nothings secure.
  Neutral
that it approaches parody, and I wondered if that wasnt intentional.
  Positive
Theres a flashback in which the Marine buys his kid a puppy' the basic training scenes could have been written by a teenager whos seen too many military movies.
  Negative
And so on.
  Neutral
Sadly, its more likely just an example of people trying to handle a delicate, complex subject, but falling back on the devices instead of really tackling the material.
  Negative
Clichs are easy.
  Neutral
Manipulating audiences is easy.
  Positive
Really addressing a national crisis takes the kind of guts that Man Down just doesnt have.
  Negative
