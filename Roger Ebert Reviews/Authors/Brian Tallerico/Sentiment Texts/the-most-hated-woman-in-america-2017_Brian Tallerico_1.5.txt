My mother pissed off a lot of people, especially those she was close to.
  Negative
Theres an undeniable wealth of storytelling to be culled from the life of Madalyn Murray OHair, a talk show regular and fighter for religious freedom who was kidnapped in the s and held for ransom.
  Positive
She fought back against what she saw as the hypocrisy of a religious community that shunned her after a second pregnancy as a single woman, starting a legal battle to remove prayer from schools and the words under God from the Pledge of Allegiance.
  Negative
Realizing she could make a profit as an anti-religious leader, she founded American Atheists, getting donations large enough to make her rich, and a target of those who wanted her cash.
  Positive
She was once called "The Most Hated Woman in America, and the Netflix Original that tries to tell her story takes that name as well.
  Positive
I said tries because you have learned about as much reading this intro as you will about Madalyn Murray OHair in the course of this disappointing, narratively flat film.
  Negative
Melissa Leo plays the controversial figure, although shes often forced to fight through bad, old-age makeup to convey character.
  Negative
We see Madalyn at several key points in her life, but the majority of the film focuses on the kidnapping in August of  by David Waters  Josh Lucas,  Gary Karr  Rory Cochrane and Danny Fry  Alex Frost, a trio of guys who just wanted to get  million and head for the border.
  Negative
To say it didnt go well would be an understatement.
  Negative
Oddly, no one seemed to care that Madalyn, her son Jon  Michael Chernus and her granddaughter Robin  Juno Temple were gone.
  Negative
Murray OHair had pulled publicity stunts in the past, so the cops didnt investigate her disappearance, even though her ally Roy Brandon Mychal Smith knew that she wouldnt leave her beloved dogs at home.
  Negative
Rob went to the press, getting in touch with San Antonio reporter Jack Ferguson  Adam Scott, who agreed that something didnt look right, and started publishing stories about the Murray OHair disappearance.
  Neutral
This investigative thread is used narratively to allow us into flashbacks about key moments in Madalyns life, like her activism for religious freedom and the estrangement from her son Bill Jr.
  Negative
Vincent Kartheiser, who now runs a fight for religious inclusion in the school system.
  Negative
Perhaps most bizarrely, director Tommy OHaver uses a lot of clips from Murray OHair appearances, such as when she popped up on Donahue and The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson.
  Negative
A -minute film should never include this much recreated footage you could find online.
  Negative
The fact is that OHaver and co-writer  Irene Turner never settle on an angle from which to tell this story.
  Negative
The history of Madalyns life has a direct, then-this-happened biopic style.
  Negative
The film in which Adam Scott appears has a totally different tone, almost an outsider look at a crazy movie that could have worked on its own.
  Negative
And then theres the most frustrating film of all, the kidnapping tale that feels like it needed to have dark comedy elements like  Fargo or  Bernie but just comes off as flat and manipulative.
  Negative
Oh, I forgot one film the story of an estranged son.
  Negative
This is the most bizarrely melodramatic arc, as if OHaver thought it would add emotion to a story, but he doesnt have enough time to devote to it for it to register beyond a cautionary tale on how not use a manipulative score.
  Negative
Clearly, any one of these films might have worked.
  Negative
Make the kidnappers the protagonists and tell the story of a trio of neer-do-wells who stumble into a life-changing crime.
  Neutral
Make the journalist the protagonist, and procedurally show us how he solved the kidnapping the police ignored.
  Neutral
You could even tell the life story of the OHairs in a way that focuses on her family, and ends with the headline-grabbing kidnapping.
  Neutral
You simply cant tell all of these stories effectively in a -minute movie and give viewers any sort of character or insight.
  Negative
It results in a film that is simultaneously too much and nothing at all because its jumping around so much narratively.
  Negative
And none of this haphazard storytelling is helped by a complete lack of visual language.
  Negative
Through it all, a few performances actually increase the disappointment, for one wishes they were in a better film.
  Negative
Leo is perfect casting as a woman whose acerbic personality helped define her.
  Positive
Every time I see Josh Lucas, I wish he was in more movies, and he uses his physically imposing presence here in a way hes not often allowed to.
  Negative
And then theres Adam Scott, increasingly one of those actors who makes everything better.
  Positive
At one point, he says, I thought there might be a story here.
  Negative
There is, but The Most Hated Woman in America doesnt really tell it.
  Positive
