Picked up at Sundance for a lot of money by Netflix, Icarus is a crackling documentary, the kind of piece that gets subscribers talking, and thats exactly what the company needs.
  Positive
In theaters, a film like this might not get a lot of attention, playing only in limited markets.
  Negative
Say what you will about the dangers of Netflix curating the entire home entertainment industry, theres something valuable in getting a unique documentary like "Icarus" to a wider audience.
  Positive
Its an imperfect film the first half-hour should have been cut by at least half to really get to the meat of the story but the pacing of the final s of Icarus is remarkable, as we watch a mans life and safety circle the drain.
  Positive
Its a movie that only begins as a commentary on doping in sports and becomes something greater about the dangers of being a whistleblower, especially when the whistle blows on Russia.
  Negative
Icarus starts as a first-person investigation of doping in sports a sort of Super Dope Me if you will in which director  Bryan Fogel, an amateur cyclist, tries to game the system in the same way that  Lance Armstrong did for years.
  Negative
Fogel begins a drug routine, injecting PEDs, testosterone, and who knows what else into his thighs and ass.
  Negative
The first half-hour of Icarus centers on Fogel trying to increase his stamina and cycling ability through drugs, and trying to pass tests designed to stop such things at the same time.
  Negative
To guide him, Fogel is put in touch with Dr.  Grigory Rodchenkov, the head of the Russian anti-doping program and an important figure in athletics in that country.
  Positive
Rodchenkov is a documentarians dream, the kind of larger-than-life character that typically exists only in Hollywood.
  Positive
He regularly quotes  George Orwell, forms a playful friendship with Fogel, and even comes to visit.
  Positive
And then Icarus takes a turn that you may have read about in the papers.
  Negative
It turns out that Russia, under Rodchenkovs watch, wasnt so much anti-doping as anti-getting-caught-doping.
  Negative
Rodchenkov becomes an international whistleblower, revealing that he helped design and implement a system that not only gave the Russian Olympians a drug-fueled advantage but then worked to hide the regimen from WADA and the IOC.
  Positive
And Rodchenkov claims this systemic cheating was overseen and ordered from the very top, Vladimir Putin.
  Negative
Yes, its another story of Russian conspiracies and urine, although maybe not the one you heard.
  Neutral
As Icarus gets deeper into Rodchenkovs whistleblowing, it becomes less Spurlock and more Poitras.
  Negative
Fogel wisely steps out of the spotlight and often allows Rodchenkov to tell his stories with minimal interference.
  Positive
He clearly realized that a film that started as the story of a cyclist interested in doping in his favorite sport became something much greater.
  Negative
Rodchenkov honestly fears for his life as more and more details of the Russian conspiracy are recorded not just by the film but by attorneys, the IOC, and even theNew York Times.
  Negative
When one of Rodchenkovs colleagues dies under suspicious circumstances, Icarus takes on qualities of a thriller.
  Negative
Will Rodchenkov survive long enough to blow his whistle loud enough for the world to hear it?
  Negative
Theres a skill to documentarians that know how to get out of the way, and thats arguably what Fogel does best here.
  Positive
He could have stayed over-attached to his own story, but he smartly realizes that hes stumbled on a far-more-interesting one.
  Positive
Theres also a palpable sense of empathy in Fogels filmmaking he clearly became friends with Grigory, and he relays his love for the man through his direction and construction of the piece without over-idolizing a man who is, after all, admitting to destroying competitive balance on a world stage.
  Positive
My one question though is who is the Icarus of this tale?
  Neutral
At first, it seems like its Fogel, who tries to use the same drugs that cycling legend Lance Armstrong did but he crashes to the Earth.
  Negative
Then it could be Rodchenkov, although he personally never seems to have achieved the fame of the athletes whom he helped cheat.
  Neutral
Maybe they are the Icarus of this tale, and Rodchenkov merely Daedalus, the man who built the wings of wax, sure to inevitably burn in the heat of the sun.
  Negative
