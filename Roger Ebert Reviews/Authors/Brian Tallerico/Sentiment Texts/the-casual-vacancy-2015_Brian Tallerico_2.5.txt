Youth may be rebellious but adulthood can be repellent.
  Negative
Maturity certainly fails to equal responsibility or morality in HBOs mini-series The Casual Vacancy, premiering tomorrow night, April  th , , and finishing up the next night.
  Negative
Its an import from the BBC adaptation of J.K. Rowlings first non-Harry Potter novel that sometimes threatens to drift away on its own casual tone, but raises enough interesting conversation points about the potential for the avarice of government to supersede the purpose of it that its worth a look.
  Positive
Every element that doesnt quite work in The Casual Vacancy is offset by a legitimate reason to check it out, at least until the muddled ending.
  Negative
This may not be on the level of HBOs striking Olive Kitteridge, but few things are.
  Negative
Like Olive, The Casual Vacancy starts off feeling like a character piece more than a morality tale and ends up too much like the latter.
  Negative
A quant English burg named Pagford is in the middle of a class and age war.
  Neutral
Graffiti has been popping up around town, usually of the sexually explicit nature, and theres a growing drug problem.
  Negative
Barry Fairbrother  Rory Kinnear, who recently appeared in  The Imitation Game is a more forward-thinking, benevolent councilman, the kind who advocates for welfare and even takes troubled people under his wing for advice, including Krystal Abigal Lawrie.
  Negative
Barry seems to be single-handedly swinging the vote against the more conservative faction of the city council, led with satirical glee by Michael Gambon and  Julia McKenzie.
  Neutral
And then poor Barry has an aneurysm.
  Negative
The title The Casual Vacancy refers to the council seat that needs filling on a textual level, but also has deeper meaning.
  Neutral
It is referenced in a dream sequence as referring to a grave something thats not empty for long after its creation and carries over into how much people can be absent from each others lives, whether it be an abusive father or a junkie mother.
  Negative
Few vacancies are actually casual in this world.
  Positive
Theyre just perceived as such.
  Negative
The mad scramble to fill Barrys seat leads to an upheaval in Pagford.
  Neutral
Three nearly worthless candidates one maniac and two milquetoasts come forward for the job, but Rowling is more interested in how death and the process of government impacts those run by it.
  Negative
I have not read Rowlings book, but it is apparently much more tragic than  Sarah Phelps adaptation.
  Negative
The screenwriter has pulled back on some of Rowlings darker, more deeply cynical tones, resulting in a mini-series that sometimes lacks the urgency that it might have had on the page.
  Negative
Its the kind of character-driven dramedy that often works better on the page than it does in film.
  Positive
Olive Kitteridge overcame this by giving us such a strong, vital, central character.
  Negative
Theres not really one of those here as Barry himself, who returns when a blog reveals everyones secrets under the guide of The Ghost of Barry Fairbrother, casts the longest shadow in Pagford.
  Negative
The Casual Vacancy gains most of its value from a striking debut performance by Lawrie as Krystal, a character introduced wearing such an inappropriate outfit to her school that it makes the headmaster cry.
  Negative
Krystals mother is a junkie and she knows shes basically seen as little more than an object of desire for her male classmates, but Lawrie doesnt play her as a tragic case.
  Negative
She finds the energy underneath the character in a way that reminded me of  Katie Jarvis amazing performance in  Andrea Arnolds  Fish Tank.
  Positive
She's really one to watch.
  Positive
Theres something thematically engaging about how the death of a good man makes other people either try to find the goodness within themselves or reveals the lack thereof.
  Negative
And the influence of good deeds linger past death, and often increase as we remember key moments from those who are no longer with us and place greater importance on them.
  Positive
I became increasingly interested in how these themes would play out in The Casual Vacancy, and then Phelps misses the target widely in the final scenes, adjusting the ending of the book in a way that just doesnt seem right here.
  Very negative
Although Im not sure the books ending would have been earned by the tone of this adaptation either.
  Negative
We cant avoid death or government, even in small-town England.
  Negative
They are inevitabilities and the best parts of The Casual Vacancy reveal how they intertwine into everyday life in ways we may not fully understand until we gain the clear vision of hindsight.
  Positive
