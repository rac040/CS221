"The Big Ask", which was once called "Teddy Bears" and now perhaps renamed in a nod to " The Big Chill" given the similar set-up of lifelong friends dealing with death, is a weird little movie.
  Negative
It features a central protagonist whos simply not likable, supporting characters who serve as little more than plot devices for its lead, and a flat tone that somehow seems to soften even its most likable stars.
  Negative
The array of TV veterans assembled for the film dont necessarily do anything wrong, and their charisma sometimes translates from small screen to big, but, as is so often the case with the indie dramedy, an unrealistic script lets down a talented cast.
  Negative
Andrew  David Krumholtz is not dealing well with the recent death of his mother.
  Negative
After leaving therapy, he convinces his friends to go with him on a desert vacation.
  Negative
Theyll hike the mountains, play some games, and Andrew will sleep with his best friends girlfriends.
  Negative
Not secretly.
  Neutral
He lets them know first that this is what he needs.
  Positive
You see, Andrew, despite having his own loyal companion in Hannah  Melanie Lynskey, believes that the way to healing is through what he calls an "injection of love" that can only be achieved by having a -way with Hannah, Emily  Gillian Jacobs of "Community" and Zoe Ahna OReily, girlfriends to Owen  Jason Ritter and Dave  Zachary Knighton of " Happy Endings", respectively.
  Negative
Of course, Andrews bizarre request sends ripples through the other couples.
  Negative
From Screenwriting , one of the female partners wants to leave immediately' one wants to help Andrew out.
  Negative
At the same time, Dave asked Zoe to marry him before the trip and she hasnt responded' never a good sign.
  Positive
Owen is secretly in love with Hannah.
  Neutral
And things get truly weird when Andrew finds a dog who belongs to a local land owner  Ned Beatty and keeps him hidden.
  Negative
Is the dog a symbol for Andrews grief?
  Neutral
A plot device?
  Neutral
Neither?
  Neutral
Both?
  Neutral
You'll stop caring before long.
  Negative
Films about friends on vacation require serious character work, the kind of depth of writing that makes the relationships instantly believable, so we care when they crack.
  Positive
Its so hard for a screenwriter to convey the way lifelong friends communicate, fight, make up, and want to kill each other in the same moment that they can also feel true love.
  Positive
Its why there are so few quality films about friends in crisis and yet so many that feel false.
  Negative
"The Big Ask" is a film that uses the manipulative devices of grief and sex to drive a lackluster plot instead of providing anything genuine in terms of character.
  Positive
To be blunt, I didnt buy it.
  Negative
Without a believable script or any real visual style to note, the small charms to be had here and there in "The Big Ask" all come courtesy of the cast.
  Positive
While Krumholtz cant handle some of the darker material, the young men and women cast as his friends all deliver on the admittedly thin characters theyve been given.
  Negative
Lynskey, in particular, so often finds ways to elevate lackluster screenwriting, and does so again here.
  Negative
She's the best thing about the movie.
  Positive
Ritter, Knighton, Jacobs, OReilly none of them really falter, they just get left behind by a so-so script that starts with a sitcomish premise and then pretends that its deep and meaningful enough to say something about the human condition and how it manages grief without asking if it really is.
  Very negative
