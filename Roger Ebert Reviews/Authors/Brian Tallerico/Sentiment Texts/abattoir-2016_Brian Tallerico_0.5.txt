With Abattoir, director  Darren Lynn Bousman takes a clever idea and a relatively talented cast and cobbles together one of the most baffling and ineffective horror films of the year.
  Negative
The dialogue isnt just awkward and unbelievable its as if it was written by a teenager raised on only bad horror movies.
  Negative
The pacing isnt just clunky, its edited in a way that almost feels designed to be distracting.
  Very negative
The performances are uniformly bad, even from actors who normally do good work.
  Negative
Its one of those movies that's so inept on every level you almost want to recommend it.
  Positive
If you operate under the belief that you can learn as much, maybe even more, from bad movies as you can from good ones, this one is a master class in what not to do.
  Positive
Perhaps the pain of Abattoir is magnified by the decent concept that is buried by the incompetent filmmaking.
  Negative
Jessica Lowndes plays Julia Talben, a real estate reporter whose family is brutally murdered by a sociopath.
  Negative
When she returns to the crime scene after the funeral with her cop friend Declan  Joe Anderson, she finds the room in which her loved ones were slaughtered has literally been ripped from the rest of the home.
  Negative
The two investigate further and the quest takes them into Julias past, including the town in which she was born, where, shall we say, things arent exactly normal.
  Positive
And a mysterious figure named Jebediah Crone  Dayton Callie is building a home made entirely of rooms in which horror has ensued.
  Negative
If one unexpected death in a home creates a haunting, imagine what dozens would do.
  Positive
Abattoir is one of those films thats  exposition, which shouldnt be too much of a surprise coming from the man who directed three lesser  Saw sequels, but its still so depressing to watch a movie that needs character and atmosphere but offers only plot.
  Negative
Julia and Declan have to investigate the murder, then the room disappearance, then her past, then Jebediah, and so on and so on.
  Negative
Its little more than a series of exchanges about what they have just discovered, culminating in a sequence designed to be terrifying but is really more comforting because you know the movie is almost over.
  Negative
Weve reached the point in a review where one could go on and on about the inadequacies of this film, including its jarring tonal shifts, clichd dialogue, etc.
  Negative
But perhaps its easier to keep it short but bitter and leave it at this: perhaps its untrue that something can be learned from every movie, even the bad ones.
  Negative
Perhaps some movies are so bad they only teach us that life is too short to waste on them.
