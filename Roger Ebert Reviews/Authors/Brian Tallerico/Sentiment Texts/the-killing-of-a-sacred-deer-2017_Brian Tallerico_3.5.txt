  Positive
Once again, as he did with  The Lobster, Lanthimos is working in a deeply metaphorical register, using an impossible situation to illuminate relatable human fears.
  Negative
The result is a mesmerizing thriller, a movie that asks questions with no good answers and traps us within its terrifying and bizarre situation with little hope for a happy ending.
  Positive
With uniformly great performances throughout the cast and Lanthimos stunning eye for detail and composition, this is one of the most unforgettable films of the year.
  Very positive
Colin Farrell, reuniting with Lanthimos and a bit bushier and grayer than before, plays Dr. Steven Murphy, a noted and respected surgeon.

The doctor introduces him as a friend of his daughters, but hes not.
  Negative
And he buys the kid presents, even inviting him over for dinner.
  Positive
Martin becomes friends with Stevens kids, and a romantic interest for Kim, but theres a dark undercurrent here from frame one.
  Neutral
Somethings just not quite right in the Murphy household, and its not only that the good doctor likes his wife to pretend to be under general anesthesia when he has sex with her.

The Murphys seem to be just a little off, and Martin more than a little.

  Very negative
Steven, being a man of science, turns to medicine to explain whats happening to his family, refusing to believe that its some sort of cosmic karma coming to get him.

  Neutral
He saves lives and he makes mistakes that take lives.
  Neutral
And he sees the world in that kind of black and white.
  Positive
Martin breaks down his perfectly controlled worldview, and demands something rarely asked of the gods, personal sacrifice.
  Negative
Working with his regular cinematographer  Thimios Bakatakis again, and a multi-talented team of designers, Lanthimos delivers one of the most visually striking films of the year, a movie that recalls prime Polanski in its claustrophobic tension but more distinctly feels like an entirely new voice in horror.
  Very positive
The Killing of a Sacred Deer takes place in a world of clean lines and kitchens as antiseptic as operating rooms.
  Negative
It's this world of suburban perfection that Martin, and Lanthimos, deconstructs with a waking nightmare.
  Neutral
Theres something about the cool, detached world of Sacred Deer that makes it all the more terrifying.
  Neutral
Of course, fallible man must be punished in a world this perfectly refined and lacking in common humanity.
  Negative
It almost feels like Martin gives Steven an out early in the film, inviting him to his more everyday world in which they watch  Groundhog Day tellingly, another movie about a man who must learn a lesson to stop a physically impossible situation and his mother  Alicia Silverstone demands he try her tart.
  Negative
But the God wont deign to play with the mortals, and so he must be hurled from his throne.
  Negative
And heres where we get to the title.
  Negative
Late in the film, we learn that one of the characters wrote an A essay on Iphigenia, a Greek myth that centers on the killing of a sacred deer by Greek leader Agamemnon.

Artemis, the goddess of the hunt, punished Agamemnon, and the only way to remove the punishment is for the leader to sacrifice his daughter, Iphigenia.
  Negative
Is the modern surgeon the equivalent of Agamemnon?

Is the child who lost his father before he could talk about puberty with him Artemis?
  Neutral
Lanthimos never draws straight lines, but the parallel is illuminating.

  Negative
And hes smart enough to use Greek myths, pitch black humor, and chilling horror in equal amounts.

It helps that hes clearly at a point in his career where the right actors want to work with him.

It feels like were finally at a time when we can recognize that Colin Farrell has been pretty great for a long time, choosing to work with challenging directors who bring out different edges of his ability even this late into his career.

Hes phenomenal here, finding the shades of a man whose greatest sin may be his refusal to admit hes only human.
  Positive
In the end, that may be the message of The Killing of a Sacred Deer when you play God, you must deal with the consequences.

The Lanthimos-Farrell dynamic is one of those relationships in which the creator and actor are so clearly on the same page that its invigorating.
