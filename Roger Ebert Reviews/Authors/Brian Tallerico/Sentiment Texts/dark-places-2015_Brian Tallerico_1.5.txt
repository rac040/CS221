Gillian Flynns script for David Finchers incredible adaptation of  Gone Girl was a master class in genre, taking an admittedly ridiculous, twisting and turning narrative and making its plot holes forgivable through sheer force of entertainment value.
  Negative
It makes sense that another of Flynns novels, the sinister Dark Places, would get the cinematic treatment as well, although this failed exercise could be used comparatively with Gone Girl as a What Not to Do cinematic lesson.
  Negative
Whereas Fincher and Flynn brought style and flair to the saga of Amazing Amy, writerdirector Gilles Paquet-Brenner presents a drab, dull, uninspired affair, enlivened only slightly by the talented cast assembled.
  Negative
Failing to find a visual language for the piece that reaches beyond a Lifetime TV Movie and adapting the material in such a way that makes her protagonist largely inactive in her own story, Paquet-Brenner only makes the already-underrated Gone Girl look even more accomplished.
  Negative
When she was only seven, Libby Day  Sterling Jerins suffered the unimaginable.
  Negative
Her entire family was murdered in a shotgun rampage like something out of  In Cold Blood.
  Negative
In fact, the murders earned that kind of international attention, especially after Libbys brother Ben  Tye Sheridan was arrested and sentenced for them.
  Negative
Accused of dabbling in Satanism, Ben was convicted on little evidence, and true crime nuts have been convinced for years that there was more to the Day murders.
  Negative
Of course, there was, because, well, theres no movie otherwise.
  Negative
Bitter and hardened by life, grown Libby  Charlize Theron hasnt been in touch with her incarcerated brother played by  Corey Stoll older since the crimes.
  Negative
Thats when shes contacted by Lyle Wirth  Nicholas Hoult, a member of a true crime club that collects items and information from bloodbaths around the country.
  Negative
He convinces the broke Libby to tell her story to the club, and she needs the cash enough to do so.
  Negative
Of course, Lyle has ulterior motives, convinced that Ben is innocent, and he eventually talks Libby into digging deeper into what really happened that night.
  Negative
Both narratives the current-day investigation and the days leading up to the murder years earlier are intercut in this murky, unrefined screenplay that piles up narrative and twists without ever considering the pieces deadly lack of characters.
  Negative
Theron does her brooding best to make Libby three-dimensional, but, and this could be partly the fault of the source material, she is almost always merely a listener to someone presenting more details about her past or entirely absent in the extensive flashbacks.
  Negative
Consequently, Dark Places is a film without a protagonist, akin to watching recreated footage on Dateline NBC, as each flashback or revelatory conversation fills in a few more details of the overheated story without giving us a reason to care about it in the first place.
  Negative
Poor Theron wanders through a narrative designed around reveals' so shes either remembering things she couldnt have possibly known about or hearing about things she should have figured out a long time ago.
  Negative
As he often has lately, Corey Stoll actually makes out the best in a few crucial scenes as the older Ben, and Hoult certainly isnt bad even if his character, like so many of them, feels like a plot device.
  Negative
All of this leads to a distinct lack of urgency in Dark Places, which makes the dour, depressing subject matter that much harder to enjoy.
  Negative
It's a checklist of awful things that can happen to a Middle American family.
  Negative
The Day matriarch  Christina Hendricks is afraid of losing the farm, their dad a suspect in the murders is missing, Satanism threatens to entice young Ben, the kid is accused of child abuse, drugs, teenage pregnancy the whole thing verges on poverty porn given the lack of genre escapism provided.
  Very negative
We needed a reason to wallow in the dark places of Libby Days horrible life to make the cinematic journey worthwhile.
  Negative
No one involved in the production of Dark Places ever asked a crucial question: Why should we care?
