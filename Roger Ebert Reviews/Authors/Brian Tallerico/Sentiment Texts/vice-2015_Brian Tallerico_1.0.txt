See that lost, uncertain look in  Thomas Janes eyes in that picture above?
  Negative
Its there in every scene in Vice, almost to the degree that I think hes winking at the audience at times Yes, I know this is B-movie junk, but I needed the paycheck.
  Negative
Just go with it.
  Positive
The problem with Vice is that it cant even fulfill those low, for-the-money, pure escapism expectations.
  Negative
Its one of those nearly straight-to-VOD pieces that fluctuates between boring and offensive, never rising above either adjective.
  Very negative
Some will dismiss it by saying its so ineffective as to never really aggravate critical faculties, but that doesnt mean its not a complete waste of time and talent as well.
  Negative
In a not-too-distant future, the elite have access to a virtual reality playground that allows them to live out their wildest fantasies with  Blade Runner-esque androids who look and behave exactly like real people.
  Negative
Always wanted to rob a bank and shoot your way out of the ensuing conflict?
  Negative
Go to Vice, run by the above-the-law Julian  Bruce Willis.
  Negative
Of course, as in all Hollywood condemnations of violent video game culture which is what this is at its core, the violence of this fantasy world bleeds out into the real world, making problems for tough-as-nails cop Roy Jane.
  Negative
The paper-thin idea being that if people are allowed to give into their wildest fantasies, they wont be able to distinguish between them and reality.
  Negative
And so the people who get ultra-violent in the world of Vice continue that in Roys district, leading him to target Julian as public enemy .
  Negative
Meanwhile, Kelly  Ambyr Childers, so great in the underrated  We Are What We Are, a replicant in the world of Vice who goes through every day thinking thats a special one and usually ends up killed, has become self-aware.
  Negative
Without warning, her system malfunctions, and shes overloaded with memories she shouldnt have.
  Negative
Self-aware, she goes on the run, even tracking down her creator and helping Roy topple the corrupt adult playground of Vice.
  Negative
If it sounds familiar, it should.
  Negative
Borrowing liberally from classics like Blade Runner and dozens of quasi-sci-fi non-classics like  Virtuosity, Vice feels as artificially replicated as the androids in its narrative.
  Negative
Judged superficially, Vice does nothing that hasnt been done before with more style and substance.
  Negative
The movie is visually dull even when judged against its low-budget, essentially straight-to-VOD brethren.
  Negative
Most people dont come to movies like Vice for complex visual storytelling, but that doesnt mean we should excuse cheap sets, dull framing and other signs of lazy filmmaking.
  Negative
Even if it didnt work as art or escapism, Vice wastes an opportunity for social commentary as well.
  Negative
Roy is a non-character, almost so inconsequential to the storyline that poor Jane doesnt look like hes been directed to do anything in the climactic scenes.
  Negative
Even the director realized they didnt need him.
  Negative
Worst of all, Vice is about giving personality and life to an android female who has been created as a plaything for men to abuse and behave with without repercussions.
  Negative
And yet turning Kelly self-aware doesnt make her confident and driven.
  Positive
It sends her back into the arms of her male creator, turning her into a damsel-in-distress who can only be saved by a man.
  Positive
Thats a bad B-movie concept of identity.
  Negative
And by the time director Brian A. Miller finally gives Kelly something to do, its in the most generic tough action movie chick way possible.
  Positive
The talented Childers deserves so much better.
  Positive
Heck, so does Thomas Jane.
  Neutral
