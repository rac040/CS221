In the same black, poisoned vein as " Dogtooth" and " Funny Games" pumps Alex van Warmerdams "Borgman," another darkly comic thriller about domesticity crumbling into violence and even insanity.
  Positive
Like a religious parable designed to present more questions than answers, "Borgman" can sometimes frustrate but it is an accomplished piece of work, driven by a uniquely malevolent tonal balance and two fantastic central performances.
  Positive
It sometimes simmers when I wish it would boil over but damn if it isnt fascinating to watch the water bubble.
  Negative
"And they descended upon the Earth to strengthen their ranks."
  Positive
After that unsettling biblical quote, van Warmerdam opens with a series of equally unsettling images as an old-fashioned hunting party heads into a wooded area with spears, a barking dog and a shotgun.
  Negative
I should mention that the gentleman carrying the firearm is a priest.
  Negative
Theyre clearly after something evil and that something lives underground.
  Negative
Having crafted himself a home under the Earth or perhaps born there as some sort of demon, lives Camiel Borgman the fantastic  Jan Bijvoet.
  Positive
He escapes the hunting party and alerts two fellow earth dwellers Richard  Jeroen Perceval and Ludwig the director himself that they must move on as well.
  Positive
Is Borgman just a homeless man?
  Neutral
Why were people trying to kill him?
  Negative
Why does he live underground?
  Negative
What is he planning next?
  Neutral
What ranks?
  Neutral
Did he "descend upon the Earth"?
  Neutral
"Borgman" is one of those films in which questions pile up much more quickly than resolutions, which leads to a growing sense of unease that only strengthens as Borgman and his mates enter suburbia and bodies begin to pile up.
  Negative
Borgman knocks on the door of Richard Jeroen Perceval and Marina  Hadewych Minis, the heads of a seemingly normal family, complete with children and a regular nanny  Sara Hjort Ditlevsen.
  Negative
All Borgman asks for is a bath.
  Negative
Can a well-spoken, seemingly harmless homeless man get clean?
  Negative
When Richard balks, Borgman claims to know Marina.
  Negative
She denies it but the first crack is already in place in this relationship before hes even in the house.
  Neutral
Richard confronts the tramp on his front step, beating him brutally.
  Negative
When Marina later finds Borgman hiding in the garage, she takes pity on him, in no small part because hes been injured by her husband.
  Negative
She lets him stay in hiding in the house.
  Neutral
And Borgman knows how to hide, often having to say "Im here" because no one actually hears him come in.
  Negative
He borders on supernatural in the way he smoothly slides in and out of the family home, and he begins to influence Richard, Marina, and their children.
  Positive
"Influence" is one word for it.
  Positive
Where "Borgman" goes from here, I wont spoil, but it takes a turn from what you might presume is a simple domestic thriller to something much stranger when Borgmans crew gets heavily involved in what one could only describe as the takeover of an upper-class family.
  Negative
Van Warmerdam is clearly commenting on class issues, countering Borgmans tramp status with the wealth on display in the world that he increasingly manipulates.
  Negative
However, the social commentary of "Borgman" feels like background more than thematic centerpiece.
  Neutral
Van Warmerdam is way more interested in mood, malevolence, and the general sense of unease that permeates every frame of "Borgman."
  Negative
To start asking too many questions about Borgmans background and purpose is to lose focus on the more tonal joys to be held here.
  Negative
There is malice, darkness, and true evil potentially hiding not just within every knock at the door but at the family dinner table.
  Negative
It only takes a catalyst to reveal it.
  Neutral
At almost two hours, some of "Borgman" feels a bit too cinematically deliberate purposefully opaque without meaning at all, even tonally.
  Negative
There were times when I wanted to "get on with it" and I'm not sure the destination satisfies as much as the journey.
  Positive
However, frustrations are few and far between, thanks in large part to the riveting work by Bijvoet and Minis as the drifter and the woman he claimed to know when all he needed was a place to take a bath.
  Neutral
Or did he?
