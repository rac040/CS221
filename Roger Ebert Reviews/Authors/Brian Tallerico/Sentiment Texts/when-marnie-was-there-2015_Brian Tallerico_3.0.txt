Its impossible to watch When Marnie Was There and not consider it as something of an elegy for Studio Ghibli.
  Negative
This tender, earnest melodrama will be the last film from the legendary animation studio for the foreseeable future, and its themes of friendship, fantasy, and a quest for emotional strength fit snugly in the Ghibli canon.
  Positive
Ultimately, the second film from  Hiromasa Yonebayashi The Secret World of Arriety may feel like minor Ghibli, but it is also final Ghibli, which gives it added, but undeniable, emotional resonance that it may otherwise lack.
  Negative
When Marnie Was There is a sweet tale about learning to embrace our tragic pasts and differences not so we fit in but so we are comfortable on our own.
  Positive
It is filled with the luscious, beautiful D animation that weve come to expect from Ghibli, and if the storytelling sometimes gets a bit lethargic for its own good, were more forgiving just to have one final dance in the moonlight.
  Positive
Like so much Ghibli, When Marnie Was There centers on change of location impacting emotional healing.

This is emotionally raw material.
  Neutral
Shes not just lost or depressed.
  Neutral
Shes borderline suicidal in ways that we dont usually see in Young Adult fiction, much less animation.
  Negative
And the intensity of Annas sadness makes her arc more resonant it feels more like a fight for survival than mere fantasy.
  Positive
After an asthma attack, Annas foster parents send her to a seaside community to rest for the summer.
  Negative
Shes instantly drawn to a mansion on the marsh, thats reportedly haunted, and often accessible only by rowboat when the tide is high.
  Negative
In the upstairs, bedroom window, Anna spots a girl named Marnie, with whom she becomes friends one night.
  Negative
Marnie is the physical opposite of Anna.
  Neutral
Marnie has a bow in her long, blonde hair, and only wears dresses.
  Negative
Anna has cropped black hair, shorts, and wears a collared shirt.
  Negative
Marnie is playful, almost childlike laughing, smiling, and taking risks like standing on the edge of a moving rowboat like a mini- Titanic.
  Positive
Anna is sullen, but her new best friend opens her up to the world.
  Positive
Is Marnie a ghost?

  Neutral
Something else?
  Neutral
The lines between reality and fantasy start to blur in the second act.
  Neutral
Anna cant remember the names of her caretakers.
  Neutral
Marnie disappears.
  Neutral
Or does Anna?
  Neutral
Its almost as if both Anna and Marnie are imagining each other neither is real, neither is a ghost' both girls are what the other needs.
  Negative
Marnie gives Anna joy.
  Positive
Anna gives Marnie security.
  Neutral
They help each other get through this melancholy world.
  Neutral
There are times, especially in the first act, when When Marnie Was There lacks a certain urgency, often moving with all the drive of a breeze through the oft-heard wind chimes.
  Positive
And then the final act really grabs the heartstrings with both hands and pulls hard.
  Positive
By that point, Yonebayashi has earned it, if not completely on his own, with the weight of decades of animated brilliance from the studio at which he works.
  Negative
As emotions swell at the end of When Marnie Was There, I questioned whether or not they were specific to the movie itself or to what it means as a closing chapter to a major part of film history.
  Negative
And then I realized it doesnt matter.
  Negative
Just as Marnie and Annas fates are intertwined, just as history and the present exist in the same moment in the film, what Ghibli has meant to the world cant be extricated from its last, beautiful cinematic gift.
  Negative
