There were rumors for years about  Jim Carreys behavior on the set of  Milos Formans  Man on the Moon stories that he never broke character, either as  Andy Kaufman or his alter ego Tony Clifton.
  Negative
Twenty years after the production of that film,  Chris Smith  American Movie has directed a very unique behind-the-scenes study that doesnt just offer insight into the making of that film, but the entire careers and almost parallel personalities of Carrey and Kaufman.
  Positive
Rather than produce a standard press kitfor "Man on the Moon," Carrey asked Kaufmans girlfriend Lynne Margulies and collaborator Bob Zmuda to handle filming him in his trailer and on set as KaufmanClifton.
  Very negative
Reportedly, Universal then demanded that the footage be buried because they were worried Carrey would come off as an asshole.
  Negative
They had reason to be concerned.
  Neutral
Or did they?
  Neutral
It will vary as to exactly when, but there will likely come a moment for each of youwhen you question exactly how much of Jim and Andy is  accurate.
  Positive
Did Carrey stay in character constantly, or just in these bits, filmed by Andys ex and writing partner?
  Negative
The blurring of that line between performer, reality, and fiction adds another layer to Jim and Andy that Kaufman would have adored.
  Negative
And Carrey likely does too.
  Negative
Adding to the suspicious nature of Jim and Andy is the fact that Carrey is the only interview subject in the film meaning we dont hear collaborating stories about his on-set behavior from Forman,  Paul Giamatti, Danny Devito, etc.
  Negative
Carrey is a forthcoming, interesting interview subject, surprisingly willing to share his own history and demons.
  Positive
The on-set footage of CarreyKaufman and CarreyClifton berating people is only interesting for so long, and actually gets a little tiring before the film is half over, but Carrey the interview subject keeps the film going.
  Negative
The career parallels are relatively obvious.
  Neutral
Both Carrey and Kaufman broke down comedy standards and expectations.
  Negative
Carrey speaks about going on stage and just making sounds to see what people respond to, and we see footage of a startling appearance on The  Arsenio Hall Show that I had forgotten if I ever saw it.
  Positive
He speaks of his own personal Mr. Hyde coming out on stage, taking over for Jim, and thats a loss of control that Kaufman seemed to like in comedy as well.
  Negative
There are also some emotional memories of his father, a man who taught him a lesson about going for success by failing in a way.
  Negative
Carrey is open and brought to tears a few times.
  Positive
The genius of Andy Kaufman has been well-reported and clear in Formans film but this movie works as a testament to the ability of Carrey more than the man he played.
  Positive
Whatever you may think of his acting chops or comedic skill, the man gives his all to his work, something that he expresses as something almost out of his control the films, the roles, the characters come to him through something akin to destiny.
  Positive
Again, this could all be bullshit.
  Negative
Or it could be pure and true.
  Neutral
I think Kaufman would have liked that well never really know.
  Neutral
Ultimately, Jim and Andy works best as a reminder of the skill level and commitment of its two title performers.
  Positive
Theres some footage of  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and  The Truman Show that really reminded me how much I love those movies and made me want to watch them again.
  Positive
And theres no denying Kaufmans fearlessness, which is what it feels like Carrey wanted to channel most of all in his Man on the Moon performance.
  Negative
Whats more fearless than never leaving character and demanding people refer to you as Andy or Tony?
  Negative
The only problem with Jim and Andy is that youll get most of this in about half of the films running time.
  Negative
It doesnt quite justify a feature, and would have worked phenomenally as a tighter doc short.
  Positive
Of course, Tony Clifton never would have allowed a film about him to be anything less than feature length.
  Negative
