Anton Corbijns A Most Wanted Man has an added and perhaps unwanted gravity by virtue of forever bearing the title of The Last Leading Role of  Philip Seymour Hoffman.
  Positive
Watching one of the great American actors embody his final leading man gives the entire piece the air of a haunting, particularly because PSHs character is such a world-weary, melancholic guy, someone who seems to be out of time and patience.
  Positive
It has been difficult to sever the truth of cinemas loss from his characters when watching Hoffmans work since his passing but this is the only time in which it feels like his tragic death has actually changed the final product it was somehow easier to get past in "Gods Pocket," the "Capote" screening at Ebertfest and I imagine it will be in "Mockingjay" later this year.
  Very negative
Corbijn keeps the action of "A Most Wanted Man" at arms length or greater, never finding the heart of the piece despite mostly solid performances and strong production values.
  Very positive
He allows us to stay disengaged from the narrative itself and to be distracted by how much the movie world has lost.
  Positive
Hoffman plays Gunther Bachmann, a man trapped in bureaucracy and shackled by a government that doesnt give him the trust or tools he needs to do his job.
  Negative
Bachmann is an intelligence expert in Hamburg, Germany, a place that will never be the same in terms of espionage because it served as the home base for the  hijackers.
  Positive
How did the entire intelligence community there not see that coming?
  Neutral
Since that fateful day, Bachmann and his team which includes  Daniel Bruhl and  Nina Hoss have been forced to work on an ever-shifting landscape.
  Negative
The government wants to hammer down on any nail that looks out of place but Bachmann knows that its the long, patient game that reaps the biggest rewards in the world of espionage.
  Positive
Bachmann stumbles upon one of the biggest cases of his career when a Russian man named Issa Karpov  Grigoriy Dobrygin arrives in Hamburg, seeking asylum and his notoriously evil fathers massive fortune.
  Negative
Issa is a half-Chechen, half-Russian Muslim, a title that raises every possible red flag in the eyes of Bachmanns team and those above him.
  Negative
Bachmanns superiors want to grab Issa immediately.
  Negative
Bachmann knows that finding outwhy Issa arrived in Hamburg is more important than just capturing him.
  Positive
So the follow game begins.
  Neutral
Issa tracks down a banker the always-effective  Willem Dafoe, seeking his fathers dirty money.
  Negative
He also forms a friendship with a human rights activist named Annabel Richter played hollowly by  Rachel McAdams, who ends up an important cog in Le Carres machine, as do a CIA operative played by  Robin Wright and a suspicious Muslim leader played by  Homayoun Ershadi.
  Negative
As in "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy" and "The Constant Gardener," everyone has a role to play in the spy game.
  Positive
And its remarkable how much tension Le Carre can draw without much violence or traditional action at all.
  Positive
In "A Most Wanted Man," every decision, every admittance, every secret revealed or held can collapse the house of cards that Bachmann needs to stay upright to stop another .
  Negative
It is a vision of the spy game as one of neverending frustrations and roadblocks.
  Positive
It is also a cold, distant film' more than it needed to be.
  Negative
Constant Gardner and Tinker Tailor drew audiences into their complex world through their relatable characters, mostly the pair played so expertly by  Rachel Weisz and  Gary Oldman, respectively, but Corbijn offers no such channel into A Most Wanted Man.
  Negative
There are glimpses of humanity in Hoffmans staccato German-accented delivery but the problem comes in the dynamic between Annabel and Issa.
  Negative
This should be the heat and emotion of the film, balanced against the cold visual palette that Corbijn and his team have chosen for the rest of it.
  Negative
Amidst the metal of surveillance fans and glass windows of conference rooms in which life and death decisions are being made, there is a tortured, broken soul of a MuslimChechen young man looking for anything human to latch on to.
  Negative
Sadly, Corbijn doesnt seem interested enough in the characters of Issa and Annabel, making both of them mere plot devices.
  Negative
Anton Corbijn is a detailed, precise filmmaker, a fact that brought a fascinating level of detail to the underrated " The American."
  Very positive
Here, his precision plays up Le Carres hopelessness in a spy game that one knows will never work out the right way for all parties involved.
  Negative
In todays world of espionage, someone is always going to lose.
  Negative
It's far from a complete failure but the flaws of A Most Wanted Man remind us not of how much humanity and hope weve lost internationally since  but how much weve lost by saying goodbye to an incredible actor.
  Negative
