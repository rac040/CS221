Breathe,  Andy Serkis directorial debut, is an undeniably well-intentioned film.
  Very positive
Serkis directs this true story of the parents of one of his best friends and producing partners,  Jonathan Cavendish, and he does so with sensitivity and empathy.
  Positive
Its hard to even imagine making a film about your parents, much less if their story was this essential to the quality of life for disabled people.
  Negative
If youre thinking that making a story about someone that important to you might lead to the air of simplification that comes with hero worship, youre not wrong.
  Negative
Of course, Jonathan Cavendish and his best friend should place Robin and Diana Cavendish on pedestals as high as they can reach, but that approach doesnt really allow for three-dimensional filmmaking.
  Negative
The result is a film that sentimentalizes and softens what was clearly a very difficult situation, turning something that should be effective and honest into something that too often feels manipulative.
  Negative
The performances and the inherent power of the true story keep it from being a complete disaster, but one hopes Serkis moves on to more challenging material with his follow-up.
  Neutral
Serkis and writer  William Nicholson get the courtship of Diana  Claire Foy and Robin Cavendish  Andrew Garfield out of the way pretty quickly.
  Negative
Before the credits have really ended, theyre madly in love.
  Negative
They quickly marry and Diana gets pregnant with the baby who will become producer Jonathan Cavendish.
  Negative
Then tragedy strikes when Robin develops polio, told he will only live for a few more months, and that he has irreversible paralysis.
  Neutral
At first, he cant even speak, able to only barely move his eyes.
  Positive
Hes put on a respirator in a hospital, and basically told thats where he will die.
  Negative
He seems to come to terms with this, asking to be put out of his misery, but Diana convinces him to fight, even if just to get as much time as possible with his new son.
  Negative
As he begins that long fight, he takes the battle much further than anyone had before.
  Negative
When he and Diana are basically told that hell live out his few remaining days in a hospital bed, they devise a way to take the equipment needed to keep him alive back to their house, despite the protestations of the head doctor.
  Negative
The Cavendishes then take that transportability a step further, figuring out a way to attach a respirator to a chair, and allowing Robin not only to get out of the house, but to travel.
  Negative
He becomes an advocate for the disabled, and someone who really pushed to change the way the medical industry looked at quality of life for people once presumed unable to have any.
  Negative
Obviously, thats a heartwarming story.
  Positive
And Garfield and Foy play the Cavendishes with a great deal of respect and admiration too much so, if Im being honest.
  Negative
Breathe never asks, much less answers, any of the really difficult questions about what the Cavendishes' lives must have been like.
  Negative
Theres a brief moment early on in which Robin wants to die and another moment halfway through when he suggests Diana take a lover, but those kind of truthful moments of pain and confusion are too rare.
  Negative
This is a deeply sentimental version of a story that demanded more honesty and depth.
  Very positive
And the final act feels purposefully manipulative, trying to pull the heartstrings in a way that the true story merits but the film hasnt really earned.
  Negative
The characters here are too flat and one cant shake the feeling that its betraying the truth of their story to tell it with such a gauzy, TV movie sheen on top of it.
  Negative
There is a metatextual element of Breathe thats almost more interesting than the movie when one thinks about who made it.
  Negative
Jonathan Cavendish became a producer, and films are often ways to transport people to places they wouldnt otherwise go and give voice to those who wouldnt otherwise have one.
  Negative
Id almost rather watch a documentary about Robin Cavendish in which the producer could draw that line between how his father transformed the world with his deep empathy for those often ignored to how his son now makes movies designed to change the world in their own way.
  Neutral
Even Serkis, who may not first seem like the person youd expect to do this kind of prestige project, makes total sense if you think about how much he too wants to revolutionize his industry in a way that makes the impossible possible.
  Negative
I firmly believe that movie history books will be written about how much breakthrough work Serkis has done with films like  War for the Planet of the Apes and  The Lord of the Rings.
  Positive
And hes such a creative force that I could easily see him being a great director someday too.
  Positive
He just needs to take the kind of risks and seek the kind of breakthroughs he has in his motion-capture work, and try to do more than hes told he can, just like the father of one of his best friends.
  Negative
