Independent cinema is littered with lovable losers whom were supposed to laugh atwith and then be on our merry way, comfortable in the knowledge that we may be a little bit left of center but were more normal than that guy.
  Negative
What I often find disingenuous about these characters is that they dont exist in a world with consequences or genuine emotion.
  Neutral
They are exaggerated cartoon characters, the slacker as a punchline.
  Negative
Marty Jackitansky, the unforgettable hero of  Joel Potrykus Buzzard is no punchline.
  Negative
Under Potrykus clever direction and with a striking performance from  Joshua Burge, Marty goes from quirky to desperate to dangerous gradually and effectively.
  Positive
Hes not a character to be taken lightly, or quickly forgotten.
  Neutral
Buzzard opens with Marty closing his checking account and then trying to open a new one with the exact same bank employee to get the  bonus for opening an account.
  Negative
Did I mention he works for the bank as a temp?
  Neutral
Hes the kind of guy who asks whats complimentary when he orders room service.
  Neutral
After a regular pattern of ordering unnecessary office supplies just to return them to the local store to get a cash refund, Marty ups his game in terms of legality and starts signing over refund checks that were sent back to the bank due to incorrect addresses.
  Very negative
He lives alone, has a diet of mostly Hot Pockets and Mountain Dew, wears monster masks and listens to metal.
  Negative
Marty is what could be called an angry young man but weve never seen one quite like him in film.
  Negative
The reason for that is that Burge and Potrykus are willing to realistically explore the darkertragic edges of a character like this.
  Positive
They dont just present the life of a slacker but the slow erosion of sanity that often comes within that lifestyle.
  Negative
This is not an apathetic-but-content life' it is a seething series of missteps and misanthropic behavior from a man who may be delusional and is definitely dangerous.
  Negative
Consequently, Buzzard pulses with an undercurrent of dread in that it feels like Marty is going to do something very bad, either to himself or someone else.
  Negative
Burge is phenomenal here, giving a memorable, well-rounded performance.
  Very positive
His take on Marty is not your typical cinematic slacker: all cool detachment and nave apathy.
  Negative
Marty wants more from a world that hasnt given him much of anything at all.
  Negative
In many ways, Buzzard is a clever commentary on a capitalist system of insufficient checks and balances that allows a creature like its title character to hover over the rest of humanity, looking for something, anything on which to feed.
  Positive
Theres a large segment in the middle of Buzzard in which Marty has to hide out in his co-worker Dereks Potrykus basement that feels a bit mistimed.
  Negative
It goes on too long and Derek is too much of a cartoon, drawn like a -year-old boy in mans clothing.
  Very negative
He obsesses over his Nintendo games and says things like gaywad as an insult.
  Negative
Its a section of Buzzard that feels broad comedically when what works about the film is how much it avoids the easy jokes.
  Negative
Potrykus and Burge get the film back though in the final act as Marty runs to Detroit with little more than a modified Nintendo Power Glove and his fraudulent checks.
  Negative
Theres a sense of desperation here.
  Neutral
Where could he possibly go?
  Neutral
What does he have planned?
  Neutral
Its remarkably effective, even on an emotional level.
  Very positive
Theres a fantastic scene in which Marty is speaking to his mother on the phone and lying about the place hes at in life.
  Positive
When he tells his mom that Everybody really likes me and we know hes absolutely alone in the world, its hard not to feel for him.
  Positive
Potrykus and Burge dont stoop to asking us to necessarily like Marty, as so many filmmakers have with their angry young men, but by making him seem so real its impossible not to want to grab him, shake him, and figure him out.
  Negative
Unlike all of those other lovable losers, we dont go on our merry way and easily forget Marty Jackitansky.
  Negative
