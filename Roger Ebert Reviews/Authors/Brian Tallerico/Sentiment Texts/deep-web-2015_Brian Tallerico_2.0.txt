Can the government use hacking techniques to catch a criminal, and, if so, what kind of warrant do they need?
  Negative
Andy Greenberg, WIRED Its an important question that faces us in the second decade of the  st  century.
  Neutral
How do we maintain the privacy that is so essential to our society when the internet allows for so many ways to destroy it?
  Neutral
Alex Winters Deep Web could someday make an interesting companion piece to  Laura Poitras award-winning  Citizenfour in that both films are about men whose fates are intertwined with that conversation about privacy, legality and the gray area in between.
  Positive
Sadly, while Winters film, which debuts on Epix on May  st , raises some interesting talking points, it doesnt go much deeper than Greenbergs question.
  Negative
Winter focuses so tightly on the details of his chosen story that he fails to place it in the context of overall issues of internet privacy, commerce and the drug war.
  Negative
The title Deep Web refers to the underground portion of the internet that is significantly bigger than what most of you access on a daily basis.
  Positive
There were and are illegal things going on in the deep web, but it is also a place for political and controversial speech not allowed by all governments of the world.
  Negative
In other words, its important.
  Positive
Its crucial to have places online that support privacy to a degree that corporations and dictatorships cannot interfere.
  Negative
The lightning rod for the Deep Webs emergence into the public sphere was Silk Road, a web service that facilitated the sale of highly illegal drugs.
  Negative
Managed by someone calling himself Dread Pirate Roberts from The Princess Bride, Silk Road had arguably positive intentions.
  Negative
The ineffective war on drugs has killed thousands.
  Neutral
Silk Road takes it out of the alleys and the dangerous neighborhoods and arguably makes it a safer business transaction, complete with a review process for drug dealers.
  Negative
Dread Pirate Roberts saw himself as a leader of a movement less government control, destruction of the corrupt drug war.
  Negative
But was he a freedom fighter or a digital  Tony Montana?
  Neutral
The government argued he was the latter and did everything they could to bring him down, even learning his identity:  Ross Ulbricht.
  Negative
How did they do that?
  Neutral
Well, thats a good question.
  Positive
The exact route officials took to Ulbrichts identity is a bit of a crucial question mark in that their explanation basically seems about as likely as getting hit by lightning twice.
  Neutral
They essentially claim they stumbled on to the real identity of Dread Pirate Roberts through a Captcha loophole and started building their case.
  Negative
Said case included a shocking accusation: DPRUlbricht had taken out a few hits on people he wanted to see dead.
  Negative
Now, none of these people died, but folding these murder charges into their conspiracy charges allowed them to paint Ulbricht as a nefarious criminal, even though they never had to prove said murder charges.
  Negative
Thats ridiculous.
  Negative
By the end, Deep Web flirts with the bigger questions at play here: who makes money on the drug war and would profit from shutting down Silk Road?
  Negative
And even if you dont agree with what Ulbricht did online, would you really like to have a government who goes to illegal ends to shut him down?
  Negative
Deep Web would have either worked better as a much tighter TV special about Ulbricht or a more detailed, elaborate film.
  Negative
Instead, it falls into a valley in between, feeling too unfocused to really offer much insight into Ulbricht if thats even possible while also missing out on essential elements of the larger narrative that also includes polarizing figures like Julian Assange and Edward Snowden.
  Negative
Narrated by  Keanu Reeves, the vast majority of Deep Web is disappointingly straightforward and factual: Then this happened.
  Negative
Then that happened.
  Neutral
Actual insight is too sparse in the film, and the portrayal of DPR as a freedom fighter feels a bit thin.
  Negative
Winter speaks mostly to Greenberg and Ulbrichts family when it would have actually strengthened his film to include more critics of Silk Road, Ulbricht and the Deep Web overall.
  Negative
Most of all, one gets the sense that Winter was trying to hit a moving target.
  Neutral
This is a story thats still being told and an important chapter of American history thats still being written.
  Negative
Ultimately, despite some reasonably strong filmmaking, Deep Web feels too much like a footnote.
  Negative
