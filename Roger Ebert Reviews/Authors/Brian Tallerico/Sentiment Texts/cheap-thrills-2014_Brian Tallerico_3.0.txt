"Cheap Thrills" is a movie that  Rod Serling would have loved.
  Negative
Driven by a stellar everyman performance by the always-great  Pat Healy, E.L. Katz's darkly comic thriller plays that oh-so-common "Twilight Zone" game of putting an average protagonist in an extreme situation and asking the viewer to wonder what they would do in his shoes.
  Negative
It's a smart, fun, twisted little festival hit which has already garnered quite a vocal fan base through On Demand viewing.
  Positive
I wish the final act was a bit darker and that it took the black comedy tone of the first half of the film and turned it into something more of the horror genre, but this is a solid thrill ride all around, especially for those who like their Faustian parables with a bit of the bloody red stuff.
  Positive
Craig Healy is in one of life's deeper valleys.
  Neutral
He's just been fired, about to be evicted, and has a young child.
  Negative
One fateful night, he runs into an old friend at a bar.
  Negative
He hasn't seen Vince  Ethan Embry in a half-decade and while Craig has settled down, his old acquaintance seems a bit more instinctive, careless, and potentially violent.
  Negative
The "odd couple" dynamic between the two will matter greatly to their journey this fateful night.
  Positive
Craig and Vince aren't alone in this dive bar.
  Negative
The gregarious Colin  David Koechner and mopey Violet  Sara Paxton invite them over for a drink.
  Negative
After noting that they're splitting hundred dollar bills based on exactly how a bar patron sexualizes his drink pourer, the games begin.
  Negative
Colin throws out that he'll pay  to the first guy to do the shot in front of them.
  Negative
Vince doesn't think twice, slamming it down.
  Negative
It's just the beginning.
  Neutral
You see, it's Violet's birthday and this is how rich sociopaths have fun: playing off the desperation of those with only a fraction of their cash flow.
  Positive
to get the girl at the bar to slap you.
  Neutral
to hit a bouncer.
  Neutral
Of course, the stakes and the payouts increase after the quartet ends up at Colin's house and the sharp instruments come out.
  Negative
The main element that separates "Cheap Thrills" from similar tales of how far we're willing to go to provide for our families is the brilliant move on the part of screenwriters  Trent Haaga and  David Chirchirillo to give Craig competition other than his own conscience.
  Positive
Men behave differently when they think someone else, especially an old acquaintance who they like to think they have out-achieved in life, may take what's theirs.
  Neutral
It's not just turning down the money Colin is offering but realizing that doing so means it could go to the guy standing next to you.
  Negative
And so there's often little time to think about the consequences.
  Negative
It's not just "Will you do this?"
  Neutral
It's "Will you do this before someone else takes away your chance to do so?"
  Neutral
It adds a layer of social commentary and gives the entire film adrenaline as if the next challenge could be accepted before either man has had a chance to even think about it.
  Positive
The difference in social type between Craig and Vince adds a fresh dynamic as well.
  Positive
Vince has a violent streak and Craig has a desperate one.
  Negative
Which will be their undoing?
  Neutral
It helps to have a natural performer like Healy in the lead role.
  Negative
He never oversells Craig's desperation, allowing it to clearly influence his actions but never steal focus.
  Negative
Embry is solid throughout but Koechner threatens to steal the piece in its showiest role.
  Positive
He's never been better, turning up the volume on that streak of malevolence that he often brings to even comedic parts like his character in the "Anchorman" films.
  Positive
Koechner has always seemed a bit off and he uses that amply here.
  Positive
At his best, he seems honestly dangerous and yet remains friendly enough to believe that our heroes would stay in his spider's web.
  Positive
I wish there was a bit more follow through on those hints of honest danger.
  Negative
"Cheap Thrills" takes a very dark turn at about the  minute that I won't spoil and I thought to myself how are Katz and his writers going to work their way out of this one?
  Negative
They do so a little too neatly for my tastes, kind of winking at the audience as things get truly crazy instead of just allowing the comedy-thriller to naturally become more of the latter.
  Negative
It's a minor complaint for a very enjoyable cautionary tale about the perils of doing anything for a buck.
  Positive
Serling would be proud.
  Neutral
