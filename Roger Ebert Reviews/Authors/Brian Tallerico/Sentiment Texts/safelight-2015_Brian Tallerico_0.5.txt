Bad movies are common.
  Negative
Shockingly bad movies, ones that are so incompetently conceived and executed as to force one to question how they got made, are less so, despite what Angry Film Twitter might have you believe.
  Very negative
Safelight is a jaw-droppingly bad movie, a film that doesnt have characters or a plot.
  Negative
It has mouthpieces who speak in platitudes and clichs, pushing forward through a predictable, depressing narrative that sounds like a flunked high school students attempt at creative fiction.
  Negative
To write off Safelight as just another generic romantic teen drama about wounded souls who find healing in each others arms wouldnt do justice to its baffling ineptitude.
  Negative
Safelight is about the shy, crippled boy and the hooker with the heart of gold who change each others lives.
  Positive
If youre asking yourself, Do they still make that movie?
  Negative
, Safelight is here with an answer.
  Neutral
Evan Peters American Horror Story stars as Charles, a bullied -year-old who works at a truck stop with a wisecracking  Christine Lahti and, from the looks of it, no actual truckers.
  Negative
Charles is drawn to the lone hooker who works this lonely locale, Vicki  Juno Temple, an -year-old with a violent pimp named Skid  Kevin Alejandro.
  Negative
Apparently when they were handing out tough pimp names, he was absent.
  Negative
Charles' mom left when he was a baby.
  Neutral
Charles dad is dying.
  Negative
Charles brother is dead.
  Negative
Charles wants to take photographs of the California lighthouses, something his sibling was going to do before he died.
  Negative
He really liked the idea of light guiding people home.
  Positive
Yes, Safelight is one of those films in which every conversation and every action must play into the arc of the healing-romantic-drama.
  Positive
Nothing registers as genuine.
  Positive
Peters and Temple have zero chemistry and writerdirector  Tony Aloupis doesnt even seem interested in their romance, ignoring the sexual undercurrents that could have formed a coming-of-age story for Charles and even dismissing the idea that Vicki could have found real love instead of the paying kind.
  Very negative
He's too busy talking about lighthouses.
  Negative
Every opportunity for real dramatic stakes in Safelight seems to have been considered and then ignored.
  Negative
And as Charles and Vicki get closer, Safelight gets less and less genuine.
  Negative
Theyre all caricatures, from the pimp who cackles like a maniac to the dying father with the sage advice for his shy son.
  Negative
Caricatures are bad enough, but even the tropes are poorly executed here.
  Negative
The dialogue is forced, stilted and unnatural.
  Negative
At times, its hard to believe performers like Temple and Peters, who generally make smart decisions, could force this dialogue out of their mouths given the weird rhythms of the piece.
  Negative
Imagine reading greeting cards in a dramatic scene.
  Negative
It wouldnt sound right coming out of your mouth.
  Negative
The cadence of normal speaking patterns isnt even here.
  Negative
Like the pictures that Charles takes of lighthouses, weve seen Safelight before.
  Negative
And it was pretty boring then too.
  Negative
Charles actually says about his photography and people in general, If you look at it long enough, you get to see what its really showing you.
  Negative
Safelight illuminates nothing.
