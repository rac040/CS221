On one of the worst moviegoing weekends of the year go check out our reviews of  Jackals,  Temple, and  Goon: Last of the Enforcers for just a taste of the awful it was even more disconcerting than usual to hear that "The Vault" wouldnt be made available early for reviews.
  Very negative
Yes, there are films that screen for critics that end up being surprisingly solid maybe the studio just doesnt have the confidence they should in it but its more often that theyre trying to hide a piece of junk.
  Negative
So, while I desperately try to approach each film with as much optimism as possible, it was difficult when I sat down to watch The Vault to not be a little concerned.
  Negative
Much to my surprise, this genre hybrid has its moments way more than several of the films this week being made widely available to critics.
  Positive
It wont change your life, but it wont make you angry either.
  Negative
Labor Day weekend for a limited and VOD release?
  Negative
Thats almost a positive review.
  Neutral
Sadly, almost is as good as I can get for The Vault, a film that merges the bank robbery flick with a haunted house movie.
  Negative
Yes, its  Dog Day Afternoon meets  The Haunting.
  Positive
And while thats an undeniably fun idea, director  Dan Bush The Signal doesnt quite know how to pull off either half.
  Positive
Both the heist movie and the spooky flick are underdeveloped with the former lacking the intense dedication to geography that puts you in the middle of the scene and the latter resorting too often to jump scares and undefined rules of the game.
  Negative
And then theres the ending, which is so resolutely stupid that I suspect the few people who do see this in theaters this weekend will throw their remaining popcorn at the screen.
  Negative
Co-written by Bush and  Conal Byrne, The Vault is a mostly single-setting affair at what looks like a relatively ordinary bank on what seems like a relatively ordinary morning.
  Negative
A young woman named Leah  Francesca Eastwood, Clints daughter is applying for a job as a teller' another woman named Vee  Taryn Manning is complaining about checks that shouldnt have bounced' a local cop Clifton Collins, Jr. is flirting with another teller named Susan Qorianka Kilcher.
  Negative
Theres a lot of noise coming from outside from a fire down the street, and a trio of firemen enter the bank to make sure its secure as well and then theyre revealed to be robbers, working in conjunction with Leah and Vee.
  Negative
In fact, the two ladies are sisters, backing up their brother, the head firemanrobber Michael  Scott Haze, who needs some cash to get out of a really bad situation.
  Negative
Theyre not gonna hurt anyone.
  Negative
Theyll just take what they need and leave.
  Neutral
The problems start when the siblings discover that theres not much money in this small bank only about k. Thats when another employee named Ed  James Franco steps in to tell them a secret theres a second vault in the basement, and that ones got millions in it.
  Neutral
Of course, theres a reason no one goes in the basement vault, and the robbers release something ancient and evil when they break into it.
  Negative
Before you know it, people are seeing shapes that dont show up on the security cameras and doing awfully gory things to themselves.
  Negative
Now, the robbers and employees have to escape something much worse than a federal crime.
  Negative
Eastwood is a charismatic lead, and the rest of the supporting cast is adequate, but Bush cant quite figure out what movie hes making.
  Positive
He needed to co-write and direct a bank robbery film that worked on its own terms, without the hulking ghosts in the basement, but we know thats not this movie, and so the first act is something of a dull waiting game, waiting for the carnage to kick in.
  Very negative
Once it does, I was surprised at how much the leads worked to keep the silliness from verging into camp.
  Negative
Eastwood, Kilcher and Haze sell the confusion and fear of their predicament.
  Negative
And while Franco looks bored too often, his is a smaller role than the poster would have you believe.
  Negative
Ultimately, The Vault isnt silly enough to be horrendously memorable or tense enough to be effective as the genre exercise it could have been.
  Negative
It falls into that underdeveloped gap in the middle.
  Negative
Maybe thats why the studio hid it from critics.
  Neutral
It wasnt that it was awful, it was that they forgot they were releasing it.
  Negative
