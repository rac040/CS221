Most film lovers are savvy enough by now to realize that comparisons to  Guy Ritchie,  Quentin Tarantino, and the Coen brothers often lead to disappointment.
  Positive
For every "Lock, Stock, amp' Two Smoking Barrels" or " Pulp Fiction,"there are dozens of films that try for that interlocking, crime-movie magic and fail miserably.
  Negative
And the more people try to mimic the style of QT or  Joel Coen, the more apparent the high degree of difficulty in which those filmmakers succeed.
  Positive
It only looks easy, people.
  Neutral
Which brings us to the latest darkly humorous blood bath with echoes of the icons  Magnus Martens " Jackpot."
  Neutral
Based on a story by Norways leading crime writer,  Jo Nesb, "Jackpot" plays like an over-the-top story told by a drunken film fan at a bar: "Dude, I just saw this movie and it was CRAZY.
  Negative
You have to see it."
  Neutral
Trust me, you dont.
  Negative
"Jackpot" opens with a car of guys running into a strip clubadult book store and getting promptly shot for their horniness.
  Negative
It turns out that they stumbled into a Mexican standoff, and their casting light into this always-dark establishment was the spark to light the match.
  Positive
When the bodies have cleared, only Oscar Svendsen  Kyrre Hellum is alive, crawling out from under the body of a dead stripper, much to the surprise of hard-boiled detective Solr  Henrik Mestad.
  Negative
The cop takes Oscar into an interrogation room and the rest of the film plays like a version of  Bryan Singers breakthrough, Oscar-winning flick " The Usual Suspects."
  Negative
I love films with unreliable narrators and just as we never knew what to believe in Verbal Kints account of the night before in "The Usual Suspects," the best elements of "Jackpot" force us to question if anything Oscar is saying is true.
  Positive
Part of the reason for doubt is that the story the beaten Oscar recounts is an increasingly ridiculous one.
  Negative
As with so many cinematic bad days, it starts with a bet.
  Negative
Oscar and three of his ex-con buddies enter a soccer pool, betting on  games like a parlay bet, winning more based on the percentage they get right.
  Positive
Well, these lucky schmucks hit all , making them instantly wealthy.
  Negative
What happens when you throw the potential for immense wealth into a room with four morons with questionable moral compasses?
  Neutral
Naturally, they start planning ways to pick each other off, deal with old debts, and try to avoid some of the even-more nefarious folks in their world.
  Negative
The body count piles up, the black humor is layered on thick, the blood flows.
  Positive
Merely being violent and unpredictable does not make a film like "Jackpot" funny.
  Negative
Therein lies the biggest problem here: the laughs dont come nearly to the degree required to make the complete lack of morality or interesting characters palatable.
  Negative
Watching bad people do bad things to each other requires a degree of wit that young filmmakers often lack.
  Very negative
Being over-the-top does not necessarily make a film entertaining on its own.
  Negative
Crazy does not equal funny.
  Negative
And so as the bad behavior piles up in "Jackpot," the laughs simply dont come and the whole thing becomes a remarkably tedious affair.
  Negative
There are performances here and there that strike the right tone Mestad does seem to have walked out of a better film and its easy to think that Nesbs unique voice worked in the source material and works so much better in the superior " Headhunters," also based on one of his books but by the time the inevitable final act twists are revealed, the sensation is not satisfaction but desire to watch one of the better films that led to the existence of this one.
  Negative
