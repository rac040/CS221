They dont shake their demons because they wake one day and make that choice it's often a decision forced upon them by rock bottom, or, in the case of the title character in  Josh Monds stunning debut James White, because they cannot run away any longer.
  Negative
Responsibility can make adults of us all.

Few films have captured that arc as cinematically as James White.

The film opens with loud music and an extreme close-up of its title character  Christopher Abbott, sweaty, bobbing, almost closing his eyes.

James White is a masterful examination of how our behavior and the excuses we make about our lives fall away under certain, life-changing conditions.
  Neutral
Most of us have dealt with grief, loss and pain in our lives, and it does something to you.
  Neutral
It changes you.
  Neutral
Hollywood has long told stories of losers made into winners through tragedy, but James White charts that trajectory in its own way, unafraid of the ugly truth of death.
  Negative
Mond shoots almost entirely in close-up, bringing us right into the face of James White, as unable to turn away from his story as he is.
  Positive
It wouldnt work without the revelatory performance from Abbott, who commits to every emotional beat without making White too much of an asshole to make his redemption worthwhile.
  Positive
He's matched by fearless work from Nixon, doing the best work of her career.
  Very positive
Mond also carefully refuses to play into melodrama to define the arc of his character.
  Negative
There are no great revelatory scenes in James White, although theres one later on that I believe qualifies as one in its own unique way' its also the most heartbreaking moment of the year.
  Positive
James, knowing his mother is dying and holding her at her most vulnerable, tells her an alternate vision of the future, one in which her cancer is gone.
  Neutral
With his mothers head against his chest, in a position his head likely laid on her chest as a baby, he tells her a story.

  Very positive
See me as a father.

He can now see those things as well, possibly for the first time.
  Positive
Through pain, hes finding the direction hes lacked.
  Negative
"James White" is also about learning to experience the full range of emotions.
  Positive
Theres a key moment early in the film in which James mother says to him, Im just sad.
  Neutral
Its OK to be sad.
  Neutral
James is one of those angry young men who doesnt understand that fact.
  Neutral
It's often one of the last lessons we learn.
  Neutral
James runs from sadness, responsibility and pain, numbing it with his own addiction.
  Negative
Until he can no longer run.
  Neutral
The ambiguous ending will aggravate some, but James, a character we have almost always seen moving, bobbing and weaving through the film, isnt moving in that final scene.
  Positive
I believe hes learned its OK to be still and to be sad.
  Neutral
In fact, it makes him a better person.
  Negative
