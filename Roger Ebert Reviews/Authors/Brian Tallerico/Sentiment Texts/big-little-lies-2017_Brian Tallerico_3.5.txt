HBOs excellent Big Little Lies, based on the book by  Liane Moriarty, plays off how uncertainty and low self-worth can make for a toxic combination.
  Neutral
It is filled with mysteries a new girl in town with a mysterious past, a murder mystery in which we dont know the victim or killer, a mystery incident in a  st -grade class but it is more about how these secrets work to break the already-thin ice on which these characters live than their traditional resolutions.
  Positive
With all seven episodes written by  David E. Kelley and directed by  Jean-Marc Vallee  Wild,  Dallas Buyers Club, it is also a distinctly consistent vision, working more as a seven-part film than a traditional television series.
  Positive
It can sometimes reflect the soapier aspects of its source material, but theres so much to like here, particularly in the talented ensemble, that you probably will be enjoying it too much to care.
  Negative
Madeline Martha Mackenzie  Reese Witherspoon is one of those arguably hyperactive women who means well but has trouble minding her own business.
  Negative
Perhaps its because her home life is stressful.
  Neutral
Her husband Ed  Adam Scott is a nice guy, but their marriage lacks a little passion, and Eds convinced hes Marthas second-best to her first husband Nathan  James Tupper, now remarried to the younger Bonnie  Zoe Kravitz.
  Negative
Its bad enough that Bonnie looks amazing, but shes getting closer now to Madeline amp' Nathans daughter Abigail  Kathryn Newton.
  Negative
Madeline takes on projects to try and keep herself happy, her latest being a controversial production of the play Avenue Q and a woman she meets on the way to the first day of school.
  Positive
Said woman is Jane  Shailene Woodley, the new girl in town who pulls over and helps Madeline after she sees her trip.
  Positive
They form an instant friendship thats intensified after an incident on that first day of school creates divisions in the community.
  Positive
Janes son is accused of something horrible by the daughter of a Monterey power player, Renata Klein  Laura Dern.
  Negative
Madeline comes to Janes defense, deepening the rifts in the circle of first-grader mothers.
  Negative
Also on MadelineJanes side is the gorgeous Celeste  Nicole Kidman, the envy of everybody in town.
  Positive
She seems to have it all looks, money, beautiful children, and a handsome husband  Alexander Skarsgard who brings the passion into their relationship.
  Negative
Of course, she hides a secret from everyone she knows.
  Negative
As does Madeline.
  Neutral
As does Jane.
  Neutral
And so on    Did I mention somebodys dead?
  Negative
Big Little Lies opens with a series of interrogations from supporting players in this Monterey Melodrama, all being asked questions about the key players and the roles they may have played in the death of someone on Trivia Night.
  Negative
We dont know whos dead.
  Negative
We dont know whos going to jail.
  Negative
But someone was brutally murdered during a high-profile charity event, and one of the brilliant aspects of Kelleys approach is that we start to think the killer and victim could be absolutely anyone.
  Positive
The show seems to be suggesting that we are all a misunderstanding or moral error or two away from being killed by our neighbors.
  Negative
The first episode of Big Little Lies is a heady mix of style, beauty, and mystery.
  Positive
Vallee and his regular cinematographer  Yves Blanger shoot Monterey like its the French Riviera.
  Negative
They love sunsets and gorgeous architecture and expensive fashion and kitchens that cost more than your entire house.
  Positive
It is a series dripping with opulence' the premiere in particular is intoxicating.
  Positive
And yet they waste no time to highlight the insidious dissatisfaction of this world.
  Negative
Almost every person in this series is what I like to call a Grass is Greener Person.
  Negative
Even in these lives that would make most people jealous, theyre itching for something else, trying to find that elusive thing that will truly make them happy always talking about moving, changing jobs, cheating, finding a new school, etc.
  Negative
And theyre often pinning their happiness on the success of their children so the drama at school, even though its just first-grade, becomes an amplified vision of their own insecurities.
  Positive
Their self-worth hinges so much on how other people see them that even a drama involving their children sends them spiraling.
  Negative
Of course, gender roles also play a major part in Big Little Lies, from the controlling husband to the relatively useless one to the insecure one.
  Negative
These are men often in constant need of attention, as childish as the first-graders arguably more so given how mature these kids are presented.
  Negative
They can also be violent and horrible.
  Negative
And the show sometimes feels like its pushing against a trivialization of domestic violence, but thats from the source material, and something the cast here does everything they can to avoid, bringing truth to melodrama.
  Negative
About that cast its hard to know where to begin in terms of singling people out because everyone here is so remarkably good.
  Negative
Belangers spectacular cinematography few people have ever used California sunlight this well is the element of the show that will be underrated, and Kelleys gift for dialogue has rarely been this sharp, but its the ensemble that makes Big Little Lies an event.
  Positive
In smaller roles, Dern, Kravitz, and Scott are fantastic, but its the trio at the front of the show that keep it fascinating, particularly Nicole Kidman.
  Positive
She finds something heartbreakingly real about a woman who everyone thinks is perfect to a degree that she feels she has no one with which to share her pain.
  Positive
Its one of Kidmans best performances and I could say the same about Witherspoon and Woodley.
  Positive
Moral superiority often hides personal insecurity.
  Negative
Its not a new theme or even a particularly daring one, but Big Little Lies offers a modern take that is consistently engaging and artistically rewarding.
  Positive
Narratively, it could have been one or two episodes shorter than its seven-episode length the plot doubles back and spins its wheels a few times.
  Negative
But this world has been so fully-realized and perfectly calibrated by the cast and crew that youll probably wish it was one or two episodes longer.
  Positive
