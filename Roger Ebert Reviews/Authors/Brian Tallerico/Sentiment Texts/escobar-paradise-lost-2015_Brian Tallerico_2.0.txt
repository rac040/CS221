Few actors feel as present as  Benicio Del Toro, a performer that doesnt play-act, he embodies the characters he portrays.
  Neutral
In Escobar: Paradise Lost,  Del Toro could be playing with children in a pool or ordering a young man to commit murder, and he performs both scenes with the same genuine intensity.
  Positive
He has such a keen awareness of his surroundings, whether it be his co-stars, shooting location, or even the few pounds he put on to play someone as larger than life as Pablo Escobar.
  Negative
Hes really very good here, as he almost always is, no matter the quality of the film around him.
  Positive
The rest of the movie?
  Neutral
Not so much.
  Neutral
Escobar: Paradise Lost suffers from the same problem as My Week with Marilyn, Me and  Orson Welles and The Last King of Scotland, three films that also chose to capture legendary figures through the eyes of a relatable innocent.
  Negative
So, instead of a biopic of Pablo Escobar starring Benicio Del Toro, we get a fictionalized tale of a Canadian transplant who stumbles into Escobars circle of influence when he marries Escobars beloved niece starring  Josh Hutcherson.
  Negative
Basically, the protagonist is nowhere near as interesting as the title character, and so whenever Del Toro is off-camera, which is more than half the film, we feel his absence to the degree that one wonders if the film wouldnt work better without the true figure behind it.
  Neutral
We have different expectations for casting as perfect as Benicio Del Toro as Pablo Escobar than we do from Josh Hutcherson as Some Dumb Canadian.
  Negative
Nick Hutcherson just wants to hang on the beach with his brother  Brady Corbet and his family.
  Neutral
They build a surf shack in the middle of nowhere.
  Neutral
Bro will cook' Nick will teach surfing.
  Negative
It truly will be paradise and debut director  Andrea Di Stefano does a solid job of conveying the beauty of this part of the world.
  Very positive
One day, Nick runs into a lovely young woman named Maria  Claudia Traisac, who asks if hes going to bring more Yankees down to their part of their world.
  Negative
Nick politely corrects her' hes Canadian.
  Neutral
Nick is very polite.
  Neutral
Nick is also a tad nave.
  Neutral
When Maria introduces him to her rich uncle Pablo Escobar, Nick doesnt exactly ask the right questions.
  Negative
He does happen to wonder aloud how Uncle Pablo has so much money, to which Maria casually answers, Cocaine.
  Negative
Huh?
  Neutral
You don't say.
  Neutral
Not long later, Nick mentions over polite conversation that some local thugs have been giving him and his brother trouble, including attacking Nick with a violent dog in a harrowing scene.
  Negative
Anyone whos seen a movie will know the thugs end up dead.
  Negative
And then Nick happens to be on the Escobar estate on a day that hes not supposed to be there, and things get really bad.
  Very negative
The second half of Paradise Lost is actually a pretty robust thriller, especially a centerpiece action-suspense scene in which Nick struggles to keep his head above water as the world is crashing around him.
  Positive
Theres a harrowing phone call or two and some really strong sense of setting, buoyed by confident direction, especially for a first-time director.
  Positive
Heres the moment where I realized that its not Josh Hutchersons fault that his character doesnt really work, and not really even Di Stefanos, but the fact that this is two movies grafted into one.
  Negative
On one hand, we have a true story of crime and poverty bringing down paradise on Earth.
  Negative
On the other, we have the story of an innocent caught in a web of violence.
  Negative
Both films kind of work, and both films are lessened by the way they are smashed together here.
  Positive
Were this just a straightforward, fictional thriller, it might be pretty effective.
  Positive
But its not.
  Neutral
The name is right there in the title.
  Positive
And every time that Benicio Del Toro shows up as Pablo Escobar, were reminded of the movie that this could have been, making it easier to criticize the movie it chose to be instead.
  Negative
