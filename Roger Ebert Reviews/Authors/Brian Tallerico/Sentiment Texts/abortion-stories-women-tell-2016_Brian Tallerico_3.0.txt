Watching HBOs Abortion: Stories Women Tell, which gets a limited theatrical release this week before an airing on the network, I was struck by how many documentaries on the subject Ive seen in just the last few years.
  Negative
And I was struck even more by the variety in their approach:  Trapped focuses on the laws that are essentially making abortion illegal in several states' The excellent  After Tiller looks at the few doctors left willing to perform third-trimester abortions and the danger they face to do what they think is right.
  Negative
Abortion: Stories Women Tell has a clear focus that's right there in its title: approaching the subject from the women with first-hand experience.
  Positive
In an interesting twist, director  Tracy Droz Tragos doesnt only speak to the women who have chosen to have abortions but people like the security guard at the clinic nicknamed Chi Chi because shes small and feisty like a Chihuahua and even those on the other side of the issue, including prominent female voices in the pro-life organization  Days For Life.
  Negative
But whats essential about Tragos film is that the male voices we hear are almost exclusively on the fringe: men in the parking lot of a clinic yelling about Jesus or lawmakers trying to essentially subvert Roe v. Wade.
  Negative
This is an issue about womens rights and so this powerful film exclusively listens to the stories that women tell.
  Positive
Some of those stories are among the most resonant Ive heard in a documentary this year.
  Positive
Particularly memorable is the tale of Amie, a young woman who simply cant afford to have another baby as she already works multiple jobs to keep her child fed as it is.
  Negative
Several of the people we meet in Abortion: Stories Women Tell are in this situation: knowing that their family will go hungry if theres another mouth to feed.
  Neutral
Others are in that tragic position in which theyve learned that their baby wont survive after birth.
  Neutral
Others are in abusive relationships.
  Positive
A woman tells a heartbreaking tale of being with such an abusive partner that she knew bringing a baby into the situation would only put her childs safety at risk.
  Neutral
Its important to realize, although Tragos doesnt underline this fact, that every story is different.
  Positive
Money, health, abuse everyone has a reason, and despite what pro-life proponents would have you believe, none of those reasons feel poorly-considered.
  Negative
Abortion: Stories Women Tell takes an interesting turn when it crosses the aisle, presenting interviews with people trying to shut down clinics in Missouri which they have essentially done, sending women who need abortions over state lines to the more lenient Illinois.
  Negative
Tragos allegiance is clear, but these films often falter when they demonize the opponent, and hearing a woman honestly speak about how she believes shes saving lives when she protests abortion clinics highlights the complexity of the issue.
  Positive
She doesnt have any doubt that what shes doing is right.
  Positive
And Tragos film is at its best when its interested in commonality.
  Positive
Theres a great moment in which a woman who works at the Illinois clinic where most of the film takes place sings along to protestors with Jesus Loves Me.
  Positive
One of the last lines of the film is Do what you think is right.
  Positive
So many people involved with the war for the right to legal and safe abortions and those against them are doing what they think is right.
  Negative
While Abortion: Stories Women Tell strengthens its clear pro-choice stance by allowing the other side some time in front of the camera, it is not an overtly political film.
  Negative
We learn about the dynamic along this Midwestern border, in which one state has TRAP laws so tough that it pushes women in need to another, and that naturally carries some political baggage, but it is the women and their stories that matter.
  Neutral
It is the faces, particularly Amies incredible courage and humanity to let us share a very difficult journey with her, that people will remember.
  Positive
And thats why these films keep getting made, and keep mattering to viewers.
  Positive
As people debate the issue in presidential campaigns, it is the world of the documentary that reminds us what this issue is really about: Women.
  Positive
Listen to their stories.
  Neutral
