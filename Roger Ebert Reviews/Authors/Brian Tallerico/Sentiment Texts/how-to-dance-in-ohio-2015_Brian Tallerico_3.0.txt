In many ways, its a stellar example of what Roger spoke about when he discussed film as an empathy machine, offering insight into lives we may not fully understand.
  Negative
Its a bit shapeless in terms of filmmaking, but this is a character documentary, a study of people that you wont soon forget, and it works on that level.

How to Dance in Ohio observes different sessions at Amigo Family Counseling, a center for children, teens and adults with autism.
  Negative
Dr. Emilio Amigo gently motivates his patients with challenges designed to show them that their limitations are not as defined as they may think they are.
  Negative
Amigos approach can be inspirational far beyond that of his patients, adopting a style that could be best summed up when he says, They will believe they can succeed when they succeed.
  Positive
He doesnt coddle his patients, but instead sets up challenges that he knows they can surpass.
  Negative
Shivas whole film works off Amigos balance of empowerment and safety.

As expected, most of Amigos patients are fearful, but they work towards the big day, wondering who to ask as their date and even going dress-shopping.

In particular, Shiva focuses on three women a -year-old named Marideth, a -year-old named Caroline and a -year-old named Jessica.

Labels like autistic often paint with a broad brush for people who hear them' one lesson to be learned by Ohio is the notable differences between these three young ladies.

  Negative
And How to Dance in Ohio deftly captures that aspect of the condition.
  Positive
We see Marideth, Caroline and Jessica taking small steps forward, although the film is careful not to present their condition as something that needs a cure.
  Negative
Its just a fact of their lives, something they use Dr. Amigos class to manage.
  Positive
The best elements of How to Dance in Ohio dont feel like a disease-of-the-week documentary on the contrary, they illuminate the commonality weve all faced at a difficult job or nerve-inducing formal dance.
  Negative
Weve all felt those butterflies.
  Neutral
And that means were alive.
