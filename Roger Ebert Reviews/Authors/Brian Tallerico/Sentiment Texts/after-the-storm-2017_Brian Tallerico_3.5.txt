Hirokazu Kore-eda has drawn comparisons to  Yasujiro Ozu in the way hes not as interested in major plot twists or set pieces as he is subtle human emotion, typically hinging on family dynamics.
  Positive
In films like  Nobody Knows,  After Life and  Still Walking the three best of an incredible career if youre looking for a place to start, he turns the camera into a window.
  Positive
We look through it and see people a lot like us on the other side, but that empathy never comes through manipulation or clich.
  Neutral
With his latest, the remarkably moving After the Storm, he again finds truth and drama in relatable human behavior, and does so by sketching fully-realized, three-dimensional characters.
  Positive
After the Storm is about a man unable to live in the present.
  Negative
He is always longing for what hes lost or dreaming about what he has yet to achieve.
  Positive
And its destroying him.
  Neutral

  Neutral
Weve all waded in regret and felt skeptical about the future.

After the Storm is one of our best filmmakers best films.
  Very positive
Ryota  Hiroshi Abe has understandable reasons for his depression.
  Negative
Hes a prize-winning author, but he has yet to follow up on the success of his novel, The Empty Table.
  Neutral
He has a job working as a private detective, but it doesnt seem to bring him much joy and its a profession that plays into Kore-edas themes as Ryota is always looking at other peoples lives instead of his own.
  Positive
Hes taken to bringing along his P.I. colleague on surveillance of his ex-wife Kyoko  Yoko Maki, who has a new beau.
  Neutral
Even though Ryota has never met the new man in Kyokos life, he feels challenged by him, especially when it comes to the attention of his son Shingo Taiyo Yoshizawa.
  Negative
One night, during a typhoon, Ryota finds himself stuck in his mothers the amazing  Kirin Kiki apartment with Shingo and Kyoko.
  Negative
There are no grand revelations or emotional breakdowns, just a series of heartfelt conversations, but the sunlight looks a bit different the next day.
  Negative
After the Storm is as delicately balanced as any film Kore-eda has made, a film that seems to not have much action or momentum but finds cumulative emotional power.
  Negative
Ryota worries about his mother now that his father has passed' he spies on his ex and son' he gambles more than he should he lives in the past, always talking about his now-broken family, his father, his childhood.
  Positive
And he has a certain victimhood to his tone when he does so, as if life dealt him a bad hand and its not his fault.
  Negative
Theres an almost throwaway moment although Kore-edas films are so finely balanced they contain no such thing in which Ryota and his partner tell a client about a cheating husband, and she doesnt respond as emotionally as they expect, saying For better or worse, its all part of my life.
  Negative
It's that comfort with life's speedbumps and the fact that they shape us as much as anything.
  Positive
Ryota is the kind of guy who gives money to his mother and then asks to borrow some from his sister.
  Neutral
He so desperately wants to impress those about whom he cares deeply, and he confuses material goods and cash flow with actual communication and attention.
  Negative
Notice how he doesnt eat when he takes his son out for a meal he cant afford it and he totally wastes the chance to get to know him by grilling the boy about the new man in his mothers life.
  Negative
Perfectly directed by Kore-eda, Hiroshi Abe gives one of the best performances in any of his films.
  Positive
He has the perfect hangdog face: unable to make eye contact easily, uncombed hair and unshaven.
  Positive
And yet we can also easily see the good man underneath the weight of lifes problems.
  Positive
Or perhaps that should be the imagined weight of lifes problems.
  Neutral
As corny as it sounds, After the Storm made me reconsider some of my own insecurities and anxieties.
  Negative
There are so many things in life that have value mostly because of how much we obsess about them, and Kore-edas film reminds us that nothing is more important than the moment you are currently in, especially when that moment is spending time with your children.
  Positive
Over the last couple decades, he has been an essential filmmaker when it comes to one of Rogers most famous quotes his defining of film as an empathy machine.
  Positive
Few filmmakers know how to work that machine with more finesse and nuance.
