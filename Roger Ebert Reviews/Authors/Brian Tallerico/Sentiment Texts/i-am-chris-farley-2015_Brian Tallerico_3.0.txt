  Negative
As presented here, Farleys time at Second City was a force of nature.
  Negative
As the great  Bob Odenkirk whos so eloquent here one wishes he would do a whole doc about the art of comedy says, everyone who worked at Second City would stop what they were doing when Farley would do Matt Foley, Motivational Speaker, a character he would turn into one of the most memorable in the history of SNL.
