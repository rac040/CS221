The Cobbler is almost fascinatingly awful enough to recommend.
  Negative
If one subscribes to the theory that you can learn as much from a bad movie as from a good one, this ones a master class in what not to do.
  Positive
What starts off as purely harmless mediocrity piles on the narrative and filmmaking mistakes to such a degree that its like watching a train wreckthat bursts into flamesand then another train crashes into it.
  Negative
Theres something perversely fascinating about a film that doesnt just go off the rails but does so in such misguided fashion.
  Neutral
And its all the more remarkable when you consider that The Cobbler was made by an undeniably talented filmmaker, the man who has given the world great films like  The Station Agent,  The Visitor, and  Win Win.
  Positive
This film is so inferior to those works that it almost disproves the auteur theory on its own.
  Negative
It starts off innocently enough.
  Negative
Max Simkin  Adam Sandler is a quiet, kind cobbler in a New York neighborhood that is being drained of its personality by big business.
  Negative
He keeps to himself, managing his little shoe shop, and taking care of his mother since dad disappeared years ago, leaving him a story that he still doesnt really feel is his own.
  Positive
Max is an observer, someone who sees lives going on around him, like the gorgeous model couple outside his shop, but he doesnt really have to call his.
  Positive
One night, working on a pair of shoes dropped off by an outspoken criminal named Ludlow  Method Man, Maxs machine breaks down.
  Negative
He digs an old one of his fathers out of the basement and repairs the shoes.
  Neutral
He slips them on, looks in the mirror, and, bam, hes Ludlow.
  Negative
The transformation is purely superficial in that Max is exactly the same on the inside but everything on the outside, including the voice, is of the owner of the shoes.
  Negative
Of course, Max uses the magical machine on every pair of shoes he can find, spending a bit of time in the shoes of the DJ  Dan Stevens with the model girlfriend, and even pretending to be his disappeared dad  Dustin Hoffman so mom can see him one last time.
  Positive
For half the film, The Cobbler is a well-intentioned but dull affair a modern fairy tale about stepping into someone elses shoes that doesnt do nearly enough with its thematically dense high concept.
  Negative
The piece has no thematic resonance at all because writerdirector  Thomas McCarthy and co-writer  Paul Sado fail to get beyond the superficial.
  Negative
We dont learn anything about the people that Max becomes.
  Negative
In fact, the film is almost defiant in its judgment of books by their covers.
  Neutral
He becomes the genetically blessed Stevens and a girl hits on him.
  Negative
He becomes his dad and his mom treats him as if he is her lost partner.
  Neutral
The Cobbler suggests that walking a mile in someone elses shoes will make you look like that person but not actually experience anything else about them.
  Negative
Almost as if McCarthy and Sado can tell the first half isnt really working, they blow up their concept into a quasi-superhero movie in the second half, as Max juggles shoescharacters in an attempt to stop a nefarious businesswoman  Ellen Barkin who is trying to push locally-owned businesses out of the neighborhood.
  Negative
In a remarkably episodic film, this is where it jumps the shark in jaw-dropping fashion, a screenwriting mess thats also poorly executed filmically.
  Negative
The lack of tonal consistency led to production values that have no personality at all.
  Negative
Scenes are shot from flat, predictable angles, often from one side of the room, as if were looking at a bad theatre stage, on which boring sets have been designed.
  Negative
The film becomes remarkably lifeless, almost as if its falling asleep with its audience, until a final act twist seals the deal in terms of bad, manipulative screenwriting.
  Very negative
The last few minutes are jaw-dropping like a sour cherry on a bad movie sundae.
  Negative
Whats so bizarre about The Cobbler is that it was directed by a man who, up to this point, had never helmed even a mediocre film, much less a disaster.
  Negative
If this was just another Happy Madison joint, it might make more sense, but Thomas McCarthy has proven himself deft at presenting us complex characters in films like The Visitor and Win Win.
  Neutral
By the end of those pieces, we really felt like we had walked a mile in someone elses shoes, and were richer for the experience.
  Negative
Only masochists are made richer by "The Cobbler".
  Neutral
