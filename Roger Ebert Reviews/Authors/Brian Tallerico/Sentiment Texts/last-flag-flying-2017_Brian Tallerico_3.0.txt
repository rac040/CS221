The worst thing that could ever happen to anybody has landed on you  and now you just have to deal with it.
  Negative
And most of us, if were lucky, dont have to deal with the worst thing alone.
  Negative
Richard Linklaters moving Last Flag Flying, a quasi-sequel to  Hal Ashbys The Last Detail, is a film built on the deeply humanist career of its filmmaker, one that is about, at its core, what were willing to do for one another on our darkest days.
  Positive
It is about being there for people when they need a shoulder to cry on or a hand to help them get up.
  Neutral
And it reflects Linklaters undeniable belief in humankind.
  Positive
Is there any filmmaker who so clearly loves his characters more than Linklater?
  Positive
Jesse and Celine in the Before films' the kids of  Dazed and Confused and Everybody Wants Some!!'
  Negative
everyone in  Boyhood Linklaters affection for the people he presents is palpable, and its that graceful humanity that keeps Last Flag Flying from descending into melodrama.
  Positive
It dips a few too many times to stand with the filmmakers best work, and a few asides into wacky old person behavior are regrettable, but this is another solid dramedy from one of our best working filmmakers.
  Positive
Larry Doc Shepherd  Steve Carell has had an absolutely horrific year.
  Positive
His wife recently passed of cancer, and he just received news that his son, Larry Jr., died in combat in Iraq the film takes place in late  we see Saddam Husseins capture on TV screens.
  Negative
The news that Larry has to accompany his sons body to Arlington has rattled him and he needs some people by his side to whom he hasnt spoken in decades, his two Vietnam buddies, Sal Nealon  Bryan Cranston and the Reverend Richard Mueller  Laurence Fishburne.
  Negative
Cranston is doing a loose riff on what Nicholson did in the original Ashby film, playing the rebellious, hard-drinking, tough-talking member of the trio' Fishburne is the now-religious man who hasnt lost the passion of his youth, hes merely channeled it into something else' Carell sometimes looks like a shell of a man, giving the most subdued performance, and one of the best, of his career.
  Neutral
What follows is basically an actors showcase in the form of a road movie.
  Negative
And its one heck of a showcase.
  Positive
Linklater has received ample credit throughout his career as one of our best writers, but his work with performers still feels underrated.
  Positive
Patricia Arquette,  Ethan Hawke,  Jack Black,  Julie Delpy Linklater has directed them to performances that would be on any highlight reel of their entire careers.
  Negative
And he does phenomenal work here as an actors director, allowing Carell, Fishburne, Cranston, and relative newcomer J. Quinton Johnson as a soldier who has to accompany the men to do fantastic, character-driven work.
  Positive
Theres great joy in watching actors this talented being given the space to develop their characters in such a way that the performer fades away and we only see the character.
  Positive
Theres a scene near the end in which the quartet is conversing on a train in which I realized how well-rounded and developed all four performers were in that moment.
  Negative
Sadly, Linklater and co-writer  Darryl Ponicsan who also wrote the book and "The Last Detail" dont always trust the truth of their situation, ladling on sitcom-ish asides that really grate, although none go on long enough to completely sink the film.
  Very negative
The old guys getting confused for terrorists' going on an excursion to buy something mysterious called a cell phone' breaking down Eminems Without Me, which Sal is stunned to learn is sung by a white guy these are all regrettable diversions from the truth of the film because they all feel so completely like a writers contrivances.
  Negative
Last Flag Flying is far more interesting when it gets philosophical.
  Positive
Theres an interesting undercurrent of faith at play in this story faith in a higher power that leads one into life as a Reverend or faith in a system that orders young men to die in impossible wars, and ultimately a faith in each other to do the right thing.
  Positive
I wish it was even more daring in terms of how this theme is explored, but its definitely there.
  Negative
I also wanted more examination of the individual vs. the institution, most reflected in the decision over whether or not to bury Larry in his uniform.
  Positive
Does the uniform represent the man who gave his life or the system that took it?
  Neutral
And what about the flag?
  Neutral
Again, I feel like theres a slightly more daring, thematically strident version of Last Flag Flying that could have elevated this movie from good to great if it were willing to be just a few degrees more challenging.
  Negative
Linklater doesnt help the opinion some will have that this is a bit too manipulative with a score that hits the tinkly piano chords whenever emotion comes into the narrative, but Id be lying if I didnt admit to being moved on more than one occasion.
  Negative
Death comes into all of our lives.
  Neutral
If were lucky, it doesnt come into our lives when it comes to our own children.
  Negative
Were not all so lucky.
  Neutral
People very important to me are dealing with the injustice of death as I write this, and Last Flag Flying reminded me how essential it is to just be there for them in whatever capacity Ican.
  Negative
One of the last lines of the film is Doc needs us.
  Positive
Linklater is reminding people to be present when theyre needed.
  Neutral
Be aware.
  Neutral
Be caring.
  Positive
Be truthful.
  Positive
Be alive.
  Positive
More than anything, just be human.
  Negative
