Happy Death Day, a horror riff on the  Groundhog Day model, opens with the Universal logo stopping and restarting, just as the company name is circling the globe.
  Negative
Its a clever riff on the fact that audiences know what theyre coming to see a film in which the same events repeat over and over again.
  Positive
Its alsothe filmmaking team recognizing the audiences awareness of the goofiness for which they have willingly plunked down money.
  Neutral
Happy Death Day wont really be that playful again, and thats the films biggest problem.
  Positive
It doesnt seem to enjoy its own ridiculous concept enough, and yet refuses to stage any set pieces that feel honestly scary either, allowing it to fall into some weird, bland gap in between.
  Negative
Worst of all, it wastes the meta-idea that a lot of horror films are basically like Groundhog Day to an extent,as we watch relatively indistinguishable counselors at Camp Crystal Lake, for example, get killed again and again.
  Negative
College student Tree Gelbman  Jessica Rothe wakes up in the dorm room of a young man named Carter  Israel Broussard after a night of too much drinking.
  Negative
Shes wearing his shirt and her pants are on the dresser, but we later learn that Carter didnt actually take advantage of her drunken state, just bringing her back there to make sure she didnt choke on her own vomit like  Janis Joplin.
  Very negative
Of course, in a movie like Happy Death Day this sort character detail of what should be common human decency means Carter is the nice guy love interest.
  Positive
Tree does the walk of shame back to her sorority house and encounters a bunch of things along the way that the filmmakers can easily repeat in their riff on "Groundhog Day."
  Negative
Someone wants her signature on a petition' a hipster glares at her over his sunglasses' the sprinklers go on' a car alarm goes off' a frat pledge passes out during hazing.
  Neutral
I didnt take notes.
  Neutral
Youll see all of these events a dozen times.
  Positive
Before then, Tree gets back to her house, where we meet the sororitys nasty queen bee, Danielle Rachel Matthews, and Trees roommate Lori  Ruby Modine, who has baked Tree a single cupcake for her birthday.
  Negative
Tree goes through a rather eventful day running late to class, having a quick hook-up with her teacherlover Gregory  Charles Aitken, ignoring calls from her father  Jason Bayle, having a lunch meeting with her sorority at which a sister is fat-shamed, dodging college sports fans, and then getting murdered by a masked person with a large knife.
  Negative
At that point, she wakes up in Carters dorm room again, and it starts all over.
  Negative
Of course, as with that logo bit, director  Christopher Landon and writer  Scott Lobdell know that you know what youve signed up for and so they very carefully and somewhat cleverly introduce their suspects in that first day.
  Positive
Is it the snarky rival sorority girl?
  Neutral
The reserved roommate?
  Neutral
The older man or his wife?
  Neutral
Someone else we spot that first day?
  Neutral
Most viewers will be playing the guessing game immediately, and heres where Happy Death Day starts to fall apart.
  Negative
Pretty quickly, youll realize there are no hard and fast rules to this silliness, and trying to get ahead of it wont do you any good.
  Negative
Without spoiling anything, it doesnt come together in a satisfying way like  Scream or the other great meta movies that played with audience expectations.
  Positive
Its more of a huh, ok than a wow, and actually borders on a wait, that doesnt make sense.
  Positive
And its a film that I didnt know was written by a man while I was watching it, but I knew.
  Neutral
The film has a rather superficial approach to what its like to be a young woman on a college campus they get drunk and sleep with older men and fight in sororities, right?
  Negative
Again, if these elements were played for parody or more broadly, they could have worked.
  Neutral
Instead, they just create a world that doesnt feel believable, filled with superficial college stereotypes.
  Negative
When Tree wakes up at Carters, there are posters for  Repo Man and They Live, among others, on the wall.
  Negative
This should be a film that constantly calls attention to itself as a film and its place in the horror genre.
  Positive
It should wink as it scares and thrills.
  Positive
It does none of the above.
  Negative
Its flat, and shockingly predictable.
  Negative
I do have to say that Rothe, who is in every single scene of Happy Death Day, gives this film her all.
  Neutral
Its a physical, demanding performance, and shes quite good in a way that makes me eager to see what she does next.
  Positive
Her performance is quite easily the best thing about the movie as she goes through nearly every emotion on her repetitive day.
  Positive
And as the film demands more from her in a traditional scream queen sense as it gets more intense, she nails it.
  Positive
Shes so good that you wish she was in a better movie.
  Positive
Its a wish I found myself making over and over and over again.
  Negative
