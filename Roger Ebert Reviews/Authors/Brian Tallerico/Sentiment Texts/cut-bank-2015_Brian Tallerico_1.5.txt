Look at that cast.
  Neutral
How could that possibly go wrong?
  Neutral
John Malkovich,  Billy Bob Thornton,  Michael Stuhlbarg,  Bruce Dern and  Oliver Platt are starring in a Coen-esque thriller about murder in a small town?
  Negative
Where do I get in line to buy a ticket?

Sadly, Cut Bank is another piece of evidence that proves the case that filmmaking is not the sum of its parts.
  Negative
And while theres some undeniably inherent joy in just seeing some of these great actors play off each other, the sum here is a shockingly dull affair, almost made more disappointing by the talent it wastes.
  Very negative
It is also evidence in another film criticism case the one that proves that the balance of crime and comedy that the Coens defined for so many copycats in films like  Fargo and No Country For Old Men is significantly harder to pull off than some people think it looks.
  Negative
Not a lot happens in Cut Bank, Montana, a small town with the claim to fame of being the coldest in the United States.
  Negative
In fact, experienced Sheriff Vogel Malkovich has never seen a murder.
  Negative
Of course, thats about to change.
  Neutral
Town hunk Dwayne McLaren  Liam Hemsworth is filming his girlfriend Cassandra  Teresa Palmer in their favorite spot in town when a car pulls up in the background and he captures a murder on tape.
  Positive
Town mailman Georgie Wits Dern has been killed.
  Negative
Or has he?
  Neutral
And nothing matters more to town recluse Derby Milton Stuhlbarg other than the fact that a parcel he has been waiting on has gone missing with the mailmans murder.
  Negative
Hell do anything to get it back.
  Negative
From the beginning, Cut Bank isnt just tonally inconsistent, it doesnt really have one.
  Negative
Its flat.
  Negative
Theres no sense of rhythm, tension, or atmosphere.
  Negative
Thornton, in particular, sounds like hes reciting lines he just learned, and Hemsworth is as flat as they come as the protagonist.
  Negative
He doesnt respond to acts of violence like a normal human being would.
  Negative
Theres nothing organic here.
  Neutral
And that makes for a giant vacuum in the middle of the piece since, technically, Dwayne is supposed to be the leading man, although its crystal clear that even director  Matt Shakman and writer  Roberto Patino are more interested in the rest of the colorful characters than dull Dwayne.
  Negative
To that end, there are scenes that work, such as Malkovich and Platt at the best steakhouse in town and an encounter between Stuhlbarg and an imposing Native-American that he thinks has his p-p-p-parcel.
  Positive
What keeps sinking Cut Bank is that these moments of personality stand out against a field of gray.
  Negative
This film is lifeless, as if Shakman and Patino are going for deadpan comedy and only getting the dead part of it.
  Negative
Malkovich escapes the best, finding a bit of truth in the Tommy Lee Jones from No Country part as a small-town lawman depressed by the fact that he couldnt keep violence from his life until its natural end.
  Negative
Theres an honest sadness in Malkovichs performance that one doesnt often see in thrillers, and its a moving, relatable human emotion on which to hold while watching Cut Bank.
  Positive
The problem is that its the only one.
  Negative
