I was living in England in the fall of  when a little album called Whats the Story Morning Glory?
  Neutral
by Oasis landed in stores.
  Negative
Its difficult to explain to people who werent there just how big an event this was nationwide.
  Negative
Theres no equivalent that Ive seen stateside since.
  Negative
Oasis wasnt just a musical phenomenon' they were the biggest news in the country.
  Negative
Headlines in major newspapers centered on the band and their charismatic but contentious brothers Liam and  Noel Gallagher.
  Negative
At its best, Oasis: Supersonic, the new documentary about Oasis, captures this sense of instant superstardom, such as in moments in which the band is stunned at how many people know the words to even their new songs at concerts.
  Positive
In the span of two albums, s Definitely Maybe and Morning Glory,the guys from Oasis had gone from getting high in their moms house and playing small gigs to being gigantic stars.
  Negative
But Supersonic focuses almost entirely on that rise, offering insight into how they got to the top of the world, even if it comes up short in explaining why they didnt stay there for long.
  Positive
The stories about the bad boy behavior from  Liam Gallagher are notorious and plentiful, and Oasis: Supersonic doesnt shy away from the tabloid aspects of Oasis.
  Negative
Before it even gets going, Liam has been compared to a Ferrari fun but dangerous and phrases like head cases and out of control have been used.
  Negative
And the film rests on the same thing Oasis did the odd dynamic between Liam and Noel Gallagher that created both fantastic music and miserable days on stage and behind the scenes.
  Neutral
Noel compares himself to a cat and Liam to a dog Noel needs to be alone, writing songs and doing his own thing' Liam needs attention and love.
  Negative
One of the best lines is Noel has a lot of buttons, Liam has a lot of fingers.
  Positive
What most Oasis fans knew at the time and is even clearer now is that Noel was an amazing songwriter.
  Positive
His songwriting for the first two albums which is all the film focuses on, to its detriment is something stunning to behold.
  Positive
Basically, director  Mat Whitecross film gives the impression that Noels songwriting was something of a God-given talent.
  Positive
After being talked into forming Oasis after being fired from being a roadie for the Inspiral Carpets, Noel became the kind of songwriter who just wandered in with instant hits.
  Negative
Early on in the film, theyre sort of just screwing around and he comes up with Live Forever.
  Negative
One of the bandmates, Bonehead, didnt even believe he had written it.
  Negative
Another day, they ordered takeout and Noel says, I wrote Supersonic in the time it takes six other guys to eat a Chinese meal.
  Negative
They recorded Morning Glory at the rate of a song a day.
  Neutral
Noel would give Liam the lyrics, he would sing it, and they would move on.
  Negative
They have a recording of Champagne Supernova which looks like its the first time that Liam is singing it off a notepad, and its basically perfect.
  Negative
Of course, many fans who already know how much they love Oasis will come to the film looking for dirt, and theres not much here.
  Negative
We get a little bit of family insight in terms of how the brothers were treated by their father.
  Negative
They both watched their dad beat their mother, but the old man only abused Liam, who literally says that he beat the talent into him.
  Neutral
We hear horror stories about Liams on-stage behavior, including the fact that Noel became a singer merely because Liam would leave the stage almost an hour early and someone had to finish out the concert.
  Negative
We hear about almost-breakups and some of the shuffling of the rest of the band.
  Negative
And then Oasis: Supersonic kind of just ends.
  Negative
With a two-hour film, Whitecross doesnt get very far in the overall history of the band, focusing solely on their bumpy rise to the top and ignoring everything thats happened since then.
  Negative
We dont even see Liam or Noel, who do their interviews in voiceover over archival footage.
  Negative
Theres something interesting about staying there in that peak s moment of fame, but someone completely unfamiliar with Oasis might think they broke up in the mid-s.
  Neutral
They released five more albums, some of which were very well received.
  Positive
While Oasis: Supersonic is never boring, especially for fans, its also not quite deep enough to justify its narrow focus, especially at its overlong running time.
  Negative
Theres more to the Oasis story than what we see here, even if this does capture that historic moment when two brothers from Manchester fronted the biggest band in the world.
  Positive
There was something special about Oasis that will never happen again in an era when albums dont sell and social media would destroy a self-destructive personality like Liam Gallagher.
  Positive
Trust me.
  Neutral
I was there.
