Is there a filmmaker whose work speaks for itself more completely than  Steven Spielbergs?
  Neutral
Arguably the most popular director of the last half-century, his output doesnt exactly scream out for reappraisal because, well, weve all appraised it pretty highly already.
  Negative
So if the purpose of Spielberg, premiering Saturday on HBO, isnt to shine new light on an under-lit career, what is it?
  Negative
For well over two hours its almost as long as  Blade Runner ,  Susan Lacy and her team tackleone of the most beloved and successful careers in the history of film, hitting most of the expected way stations along the trail.
  Positive
Its undeniable that Steven Spielberg changed film history, and Im actually of the minority belief that some of his stcentury output stands among the best of his career " A.I. Artificial Intelligence," " Minority Report," " Munich," " Lincoln," " Bridge of Spies".
  Positive
Im of the age that it would be difficult not to be a huge fan of his seminal work,and consider  Jaws and  Raiders of the Lost Ark desert-island films.
  Negative
However, Spielberg crosses the line into hagiography regularly and with reckless abandon.
  Neutral
Given how much I adore his films and respect him as an artist, if this felt like fan service to me, those of you with less tolerance for his work should probably skip it.
  Negative
For the majority of its running time, Spielberg moves chronologically.
  Positive
In fact, its at its most interesting when it chooses not to apply that rigid structure, occasionally spinning off into tangents such as how Spielberg works with fear, his focus on father-son relationships, and his interesting recent role as one of cinemas most interesting historians.
  Positive
Spielbergs films are so well-known that stories about their power or value feel repetitive.
  Negative
Jaws is terrifying,  Close Encounters of the Third Kind is ambitious, Schindlers List is personal and powerful we know all that.
  Positive
But when Lacy starts to tie thematic ribbons around multiple films in Spielbergs career, her work has more power, especially when the filmmaker himself is open and willing to speak out how his relationship with his father influenced that thematic undercurrent in his work.
  Positive
Theres just enough of those insights to make Spielberg valuable I just wish there were enough to make it great.
  Negative
For too much of Spielberg, were treated to rapturous praise of the title subject.
  Negative
David Edelstein says that Right off the bat it was clear that no one moved a camera like Steven Spielberg, and its hyperbole like this that makes the film feel superficial.
  Negative
How did he move his camera differently than anyone else?
  Neutral
The film eventually gets at the idea that Spielberg has a rare gift for blending spontaneity with precise camerawork and technology, but its buried in an anecdotes and rapturous praise.
  Positive
On that note, Lacy did get nearly everyone to sit down for an interview so the star power of Spielberg is incredible.
  Negative
Richard Dreyfuss talks Jaws,  Harrison Ford talks Indiana Jones,  Daniel Day-Lewis talks Lincoln,  Liam Neeson amp'  Ben Kingsley talk Schindlers List,  Leonardo DiCaprio talks  Catch Me If You Can,  Tom Hanks talks  Saving Private Ryan, and many more.
  Negative
Its clear that the people who have worked with Steven Spielberg admire the time they spent with him just by their eagerness to participate in the film about him.
  Positive
And even Spielbergs famous friends pop up, including  Martin Scorsese,  Francis Ford Coppola,  George Lucas,  John Williams, and many more.
  Positive
As with any lengthy Hollywood career, there are a few oversights, although not as many as most director documentaries given the exorbitant length of this one I get skipping  Hook and  Always entirely, but in  minutes, we couldnt find space to discuss A.I. Artificial Intelligence outside of a few clips in montages?
  Negative
For shame.
  Negative
What I will say about Spielberg is that it devotes time to what fans will want to see and hear the greatest hits of a great career.
  Positive
It made me want to dig in and watch a few of the films I havent seen recently, especially the underrated Munich, and thats to this films credit "Spielberg" isfan service that reasonably satisfies those already in the club and encourages you to re-up your membership.
  Positive
We had  De Palma last year and now Spielberg this year.
  Neutral
This director-doc trend isnt going to go away as filmmakers who grew up on the artists of the s and s essentially pay homage to their icons.
  Negative
I look forward to the inevitable "Cronenberg,"Soderbergh and "Mann."
  Positive
Until then, Spielberg will make movie lovers happy, or, more accurately, just remind them how happy its subject made them in the past.
  Positive
