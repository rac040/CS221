A house with a death in it can never again be bought or sold by the living.
  Negative
It can only be borrowed by the ghosts who have stayed behind.
  Negative
Shortly after that killer opening line, our protagonist Lily Saylor  Ruth Wilson drops another bombshell when she reveals that shell be dead within a year.
  Negative
Osgood Perkins I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House is an atmospheric take on the haunted house flick that works more with dread and the looming specter of death than the traditional tropes that often define the genre.
  Negative
Sure, there are a couple of moments to make you gasp, but Perkins is working in a more circular, dreamlike manner.
  Positive
The whole film takes place in the house at the end of Teacup Road in Braintree, Massachusetts, and this house is haunted.
  Negative
This is something of which we can be certain.
  Positive
It is one of the few things in this film of which we can be certain.
  Positive
From the very beginning of his sophomore film his even-better February aka The Blackcoats Daughter has lingered in distribution purgatory but should be released next year, Perkins is playing with perspective and atmosphere.
  Negative
For example, when we meet Lily, it is on her first day in the house.
  Positive
She says, The pretty thing you are looking at is me.
  Positive
Of this I am sure.
  Neutral
My name is Lily Saylor.
  Neutral
I am a hospice nurse.
  Negative
Three days ago I turned  years old.
  Neutral
I will never be  years old.
  Neutral
We hear this in voiceover, although Wilsons eyes break the fourth wall, staring directly at camera.
  Negative
The omniscient narration that knows its own death, the character who draws us in with her eyes before shes even spoken Perkins is playing games with structure and filmmaking.
  Positive
Hes confronting us directly and beginning a sort of circular logic to the film, one in which the dead, the living, and the about-to-die intersect, and we are drawn into the center of this intersection.
  Negative
Lily has come to this home to take care of an elderly woman named Iris Blum.
  Neutral
In a very unspecified time period although phones are rotary, televisions have rabbit ears, and we see VHS tapes for video and cassette tapes for audio, Lily starts freaking out about the creepy old house on night one.
  Negative
Shes essentially alone in that Iris doesnt speak much, spending her time in bed.
  Negative
We only have one real scene of character exposition early, when Lily is on the phone and we learn that she was almost married once.
  Negative
From then, we flash forward almost a year.
  Neutral
And, of course, Perkins knows well remember that narration about Lily not making her next birthday.
  Negative
It's hard to explain the circular nature of Perkins ambitious narrative.
  Positive
Blum is a famous writer, and her most famous book is called The Lady in the Walls, featuring a lead character named Polly.
  Positive
From the beginning, Iris calls Lily by the name Polly, and the frightened lead eventually cracks open the famous book, leading to a few scenes that are either direct adaptations of that story, flashbacks to something that happened in the house, or a dreamvision of some sort.
  Negative
Who knows?
  Neutral
Perkins is never quite that literal, sometimes frustratingly so but mostly in a way that reveals his deep ambition as a storyteller.
  Negative
Most importantly, this is not a film to be solved.
  Negative
It is a mood piece made by someone constantly playing with structure, but never in a way that calls overt attention to itself.
  Negative
For example, when Lily starts reading The Lady in the Walls, the opening line is almost exactly the same as when she came to the house The pretty thing you are looking at now is me.
  Negative
Why?
  Negative
Are LilyPolly the same?
  Neutral
And how did Iris write about them?
  Neutral
What does that mean?
  Neutral
There are traditional haunted house elements in Perkins film like a mold problem that hints at something hidden in the walls and a use of reflection to produce a scare, but it almost feels like Perkins uses those just to keep tethered to a genre with which he wants to do something far more ambitious.
  Negative
What is a haunted house movie about if not death?
  Neutral
Sure, the bad ones are often about jump scares and poor CGI, but we fear haunted houses because they remind us of mortality and force us to question that which we know about it.
  Negative
I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House isnt about ghosts as much as its about death the one coming soon for the homeowner, the one of the protagonist in her book, the one were told is coming for its protagonist.
  Negative
And all of these deaths swirl around to the point that they hang in the air, creating dread.
  Negative
In many ways, I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House feels more like a first film than February in that its ambitions sometimes feel a bit out of reach for the final product.
  Negative
Its something that might have worked even better as a short film or an episode of an anthology series, as one can feel it stretching to meet a short running time.
  Negative
In simple terms, it feels more like a short story than a novel.
  Negative
However, its a short story that I immediately started again, already getting more out of the first act than I did the first time.
  Neutral
Its a movie thats too opaque and unusual for some viewers, but those who do give in to its unique rhythms and approach will find something often haunting and ultimately rewarding.
  Positive
