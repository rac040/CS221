Oren Movermans The Dinner is an incredibly frustrating movie, almost purposefully so.
  Very negative
It is a film about people who say things like Were gonna talk tonight  put it all on the table, and then never do.
  Negative
Theyre constantly avoiding not just the truth but basic human interaction.
  Negative
Theyre always interrupting each other or leaving the conversation just as its getting going.
  Neutral
And Moverman attempts to mimic this feeling of constant interruption in his filmmaking decisions, cutting back and forth in time, always keeping his camera moving, and trying to add strange tension to a story that lacks it.
  Negative
The result is a film thats often infuriating, one that works in fits and starts but ultimately fails.
  Negative
Paul Lohman  Steve Coogan and his wife Claire  Laura Linney are going to dinner at a remarkably fancy restaurant with Pauls relatively-estranged brother Stan  Richard Gere, a high-powered politician, and his wife Katelyn  Rebecca Hall.
  Negative
Theyre getting together to discuss a horrific incident involving their children, which we see in flashes back in time.
  Positive
Their affluenza-stricken progeny did something horrible to a homeless woman sheltering in an ATM room, and it was caught on a security tape.
  Very negative
Not only could their kids go to jail, but Stans political career could be derailed.
  Negative
As more and more lavish courses come their way shepherded by an effective  Michael Chernus as a nervous matre d, the couples bicker, fight, and reveal the depths of their personal problems.
  Negative
It has echoes of Polanskis  Carnage in the way Overman attempts to analyze how our childrens behavior can often become a mirror of our own issues, but it's all mysterious back story revelations instead of anything insightful about who these people are today or where they're going.
  Negative
To say that the flow of The Dinner is clunky would be an understatement.
  Negative
It is purposefully designed to push against traditional cinematic rhythms.
  Neutral
However, formal experimentation can easily give way to incoherent nonsense, and Moverman falls into the second category far too often here.
  Neutral
Theres a centerpiece at Gettysburg, another flashback to when Paul and Stan visited there, that feels interminable.
  Negative
Its the kind of bizarre sequence that forces you to question what youre watching and why which could be Movermans intent, or he could just have been too opaque when it came to his writing.
  Negative
Is Paul going crazy?
  Neutral
Has he always been crazy?
  Neutral
Theres a motif of living in the past Paul is a history teacher but its woefully underdeveloped.
  Negative
Paul says things like History is either a lie or a bore, which sounds much deeper than it actually is.
  Negative
History cant compete with the now.
  Neutral
Yeah, what else ya got?
  Neutral
And if that's the case, why is the "now" in this film so secondary?
  Neutral
There are moments in The Dinner when the sheer talent of the cast pushes through the formal nonsense.
  Positive
Movermans greatest asset has always been his work with actors, which is why performances from the films  The Messenger and  Time Out of Mind have been cited on Best of the Year lists.
  Negative
Theres a great four-person scene just over an hour in when the cast finally gets to the meat of the matter and you can see a glimpse of the actor-centric film that this could have been.
  Positive
It feels like Moverman was worried that the source material, a book by  Herman Koch thats already been adapted three times, would be too stagey, but he pushes the meter way too far in the other direction, overcompensating and overshadowing the best assets of his work.
  Negative
Having said that, Linney still gets some killer moments in the final act.
  Negative
She somehow always finds a way to do so.
  Positive
Coogan makes out less successfully, but its in part because this character is such a mess, bouncing in and out of narration and woefully inconsistent in key ways.
  Negative
The Dinner should be a scabrous satire of awful kids with more awful parents.
  Negative
Koch notoriously declined to attend the afterparty following the Berlin premiere because he was so turned off by what he saw as moralizing in this film version.
  Negative
Im not sure I see that, but Im not sure I see anything.
  Negative
Its as if Moverman couldnt commit to the stinging, harsh take on affluence that this needed to work, and so he fell back on filmmaking tricks instead.
  Negative
Hes trying to keep himself entertained, playing with structure instead of finding a reason to do so.
  Positive
The form only loosely feels like its trying to comment on or enhance the action here.
  Negative
Most of the time, its a meal that just doesnt leave you feeling full in any way.
  Positive
