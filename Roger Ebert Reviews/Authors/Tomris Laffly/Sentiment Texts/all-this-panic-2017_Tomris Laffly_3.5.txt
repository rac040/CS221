Regardless of how far removed you might be from your teenage years, also known as the agony-filled era of pain when the world is both your oyster and your enemy, you probably remember at least one thing about it: time never seemed to pass fast enough back then.
  Negative
Days felt longer.
  Neutral
A school year just seemed to not end, and summer never arrived quickly enough.
  Negative
Jenny Gages deep, shrewd and beautifully realized documentary All This Panic is anchored in this very nature of time in the way teenagers generally relate to it.
  Positive
Its every dreamy scene, filled with worthiness and merit, is plugged in to an in-the-moment feeling that accompanies a group of young Brooklyn-women the film follows over a three year-period.
  Negative
No wonder the lean, -minute running time of All This Panic is not a liability: Gage makes each minute boldly and deeply matter.
  Neutral
All This Panic was conceived when debuting director Gage and her husband  Tom Betterton, the cinematographer of the film, met Ginger and Dusty, two teenage sisters living in the same Clinton Hill neighborhood.
  Negative
After getting to know the two sisters and observing their evolving teenage lives, the couple slowly found themselves inside the circle of their friends, among which is Lena, Gingers best friend, one of the strongest and most present voices within the group and in the documentary.
  Positive
An aspiring philosopher with family troubles, she recalls the time she casually found out one day that her parents were getting a divorce, during a family viewing of Avatar: The Last Airbender.
  Positive
It left a mark on her.
  Neutral
Then there is Sage, a brainy student who attends a high-status private school in Manhattan, raised by a single mother with whom she has a close relationship.
  Negative
The only black teenager among the group portrayed in the film and an outspoken feminist who complains about the over-sexualized female body, Sage seems to have figured out the lose-lose way women are ruthlessly categorized in society based on their looks.
  Negative
We also get to meet Olivia, a kindly, soft-spoken young woman whos just figuring out her sexual identity.
  Negative
She candidly but ever so shyly speaks of her sexual leanings and doubts while being filmed, though she notes she hasnt yet shared it with anyone close to her.
  Positive
The last two members of the circle are Delia, Olivias best friend who seems to detest all this panic with regards to high school one example is her friends frantically trying to pick the right outfit for the first day of school, and the savvy and resourceful Ivy.
  Positive
The method of filming the girls over a three-year period might inevitably bring to mind  Richard Linklaters  Boyhood, in which he told the fictional life story of a Texan boy over a -year-period, using the same actors throughout.
  Neutral
Linklaters accomplished narrative feature isnt quite an apt comparison for All This Panic however, since the girls evolution in front of the camera from changing hairstyles and colors to budding ideals and growing frustrations is an organic process, which Gage and Betterton lovingly observe without interference.
  Negative
If anything, the fleeting sense we get from the passage of time in All This Panic, the lack of pretension between friends and the general hazy feeling stretched over the collective angst of the seven teenagers loosely resembles  David Robert Mitchells The Myth of the American Sleepover instead, a recent-ish and under-seen narrative that also deals with teenage anxieties and troubles.
  Negative
We quietly survey as sexualities bourgeon, personalities develop and get between longtime friendships, and curiosities spark in this unusual coming-of-age film, edited and assembled with understated grace.
  Positive
Throughout All This Panic, Gage and Bettertons professional background in photography luxuriously shows.
  Positive
In one of the films earlier scenes, we watch Dusty and Lena converse and quarrel on a picturesque beach' an incident shot with artistic framing that evokes a sense of melancholy.
  Negative
The duo consistently treats less visually appealing environs with the same discipline, making brick walls, cramped interiors and rundown rooftops seem intentional and beautiful creative choices rather than obligatory backdrops.
  Positive
In the end, what they achieve is both meaningful and strikingly beautiful, full of that boundless hopeful mystery one feels at maximum during teenage years.
  Very positive
