If "Raze" had been released in ,  Quentin Tarantino would never shut up about it.
  Negative
He still might not shut up about it because it stars  Zoe Bell, the New Zealand stuntwoman who doubled for  Uma Thurman in the "Kill Bill" films and clung to the hood of Stuntman Mike's car in "Death Proof."
  Negative
Directed by  Josh C. Waller from a screenplay by  Robert Beaucage, this tale of captive women fighting to the deathhas the poker-faced craziness of a s or early 's midnight flick, the kind that made audiences howl for blood.
  Negative
"Raze" starts with an obvious fake-out, making you think it's about another character when it's obviously about Sabrina, whose raging face adorns the film's poster.
  Negative
A young woman  Rachel Nichols wakes up on the floor of the dungeon following a one-night stand with a hunky guy she picked up in a bar, wanders the prison halls and runs into Sabrina, who fights and kills her in a close-quarters confrontation filmed in Jason Bourne whiplash-cam.
  Negative
Then it's on to the premise, the characters and their backstories.
  Neutral
The prison is a family-run institution that's pitted women against each other for generations.
  Positive
The guards are male, the prisoners female.
  Neutral
The current jailers are a creepy, ostentatiously moralistic married couple  Sherilyn Fenn and  Doug Jones who dote on each other when they aren't berating the prisoners for their sins.
  Negative
The inmates all have experience fighting, professionally or otherwise.
  Neutral
Most studied martial arts for self-defense' the wiseass Phoebe, played like a sneering  Lee Marvin villain by  Rebecca Marshall, has been physically and sexually abused since childhood.
  Negative
The jailers compel the women by threatening their loved ones, images of whom are piped in via closed-circuit TV.
  Negative
These human insurance policies have no idea they're being monitored, much less marked for death.
  Negative
The best genre movies create their own reality, then fill it with situations compelling enough that the viewer is rarely distracted by what  Alfred Hitchcock called "refrigerator logic."
  Positive
How did the jailers successfully kidnap so many strong women?
  Neutral
Why are the women conventionally beautiful enough to be catalog models?
  Neutral
Do the jailers buy their sweatpants in bulk?
  Neutral
You don't ask such questions of "Raze" because it's a dream logic movie comprised of bits and pieces of other dream logic movies: "Battle Royale," the Hunger Games series, "The Most Dangerous Game," a smidgen of " Fight Club," a dollop of "Oldboy."
  Negative
The characters are sketched with two or three details, then filled in by the actors' furiously physical performances.
  Negative
In place of a standard three-act structure, "Raze" is presented as a series of bouts joined by thin strands of dramatic connective tissue.
  Negative
Onscreen fight cards tell you who's up next.
  Neutral
Of course "Raze" begs to be read as allegory, perhaps for the way patriarchal society treats women as objects, entertainments, prisoners or slaves, pits them against one another for the prize of male approval, and pressures them to conform to limiting roles: girlfriend, wife, mother, tramp.
  Negative
Tantalizing fragments of meaning ricochet in the film's margins, but they never freeze long enough to let you look at them.
  Negative
That's probably for the best.
  Positive
"Raze" is not an especially political or even introspective work, though it sometimes poses as one.
  Negative
If its direction and fight choreography were a more imaginative if each showdown had a strikingly different look, or were built around a different concept, as in Tarantino's "Kill Bill" movies it might have been a classic of sorts.
  Negative
Instead it's a solid feature with a few inspired moments.
  Positive
Its dark virtues are visceral and emotional: the amped-up sound effects of heels and knuckles bruising flesh and cracking bone' the intelligence in Sabrina's eyes as she plots against her jailers' the weirdly powerful confrontation between two combatants, one of whom tries to psych out her opponent by repeatedly asking her, "How's your mother?"
  Positive
This is a women's prison picture, but not the kind you're thinking of.
  Neutral
There are no rape scenes or shower scenes.
  Negative
Moments in which men intimidate or overpower women are about bulk and intensity, not sexual terrorism.
  Neutral
"Raze" doesn't objectify its female fighters any more than the Olympics objectify their athletes.
  Negative
Its women are posed and shot like hounded Amazons, and the director gives every major character a spot-lit pirouette' the best finds Marshall taunting future adversaries in the cellblock hall, then stepping through an entryway and giving the finger to the viewer, or so it seems before the doors slide shut.
  Negative
The female characters are gladiators.
  Positive
Sabrina is Spartacus in a tank top.
  Negative
Bell's performance is the best reason to see "Raze."
  Positive
She's just right as Sabrina, a strong-silent type in Steve McQueen-Clint Eastwood mode.
  Positive
The character mangles adversaries with her fists, feet, forehead and thumbs, but Bell's most fascinating moments are quiet ones where you watch her Hellenic face in close-up, thinking.
  Positive
How was this actress not cast as Wonder Woman?
  Neutral
Can anything be done to remedy this injustice?
  Negative
