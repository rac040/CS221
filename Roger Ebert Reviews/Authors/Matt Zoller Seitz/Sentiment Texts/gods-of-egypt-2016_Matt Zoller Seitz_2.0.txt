They don't make movies like "Gods of Egypt" anymore, and yet they never made movies like "Gods of Egypt."
  Negative
This is the paradox, and for a while, it's a fun one.
  Positive
But after a point, this proudly silly film about gods and mortals in ancient Egypt devolves into an sword-and-sorcery-flavored riff on a weak Marvel movie.
  Negative
The alternately cornball and self-aware dialogue and the clearly not state-of-the-art CGI would seeming charmingly retro like something from a TV miniseries two decades ago if the movie didn't trot out one epic action film cliche after another.
  Negative
Gerard Butler stars as Set, god of disorder.
  Negative
He wrests control of his kingdom from his brother, Horus  Nikolaj Coster-Waldau in an opening hand-to-hand combat sequence where the siblings clang swords and beat on each other for a while, until they both assume the form of armored creatures that look like Marvel-movie android warriors and leap through the air, knocking each other against pillars until Set finally tears Horus's eyes out.
  Negative
Why the combatants don't assume super-powerful form to start with is one of those questions that films like this never answer.
  Negative
At first, Set wants to kill Horus outright, but relents when the goddess Hathor  Elodie Yung begs him to be merciful.
  Negative
Set banishes the blind Horus to a crypt where he's eventually set free by the intrepid mortal Bek  Brenton Thwaites, a resourceful thief whose beautiful young lover, Zaya  Courtney Eaton of " Mad Max: Fury Road", died from an arrow wound and is now trekking through the underworld en route to her final judgment.
  Negative
According to lore, only the king of Egypt can free a dead person from the between-state and return them to the land of the living.
  Negative
That means Horus has only a few days to wrest control of the kingdom from Set.
  Negative
If he doesn't, Bek's girlfriend will stay dead forever.
  Negative
That's a pretty good setup for an action-adventure: a coup on a timetable.
  Positive
The director,  Alex Proyas " The Crow," " Dark City", seems sure of what sort of film he wants to make.
  Negative
Despite the ostentatiously virtual images and the comic book and borderline science-fiction touches, in its heart "Gods of Egypt" is an adventure in what used to be called the "swords and sandals" genre.
  Negative
Every brawny chest is waxed, every bosom heaving.
  Negative
The characters address  crowds of thousands of digital, alas extras, and run their enemies  through with swords and spears and zap them with death rays hey, some  of them are gods, okay?
  Negative
, and swear fealty to this and vengeance against  that, and tromp around in metal tunics while saying things like, "Why  was I made to walk on burning sands while my brother strolled barefoot  alone on the shores of the Nile?"
  Negative
and "Give me my eyes!"
  Positive
and "Were you  using my house for your fornicating?"
  Neutral
It's stocked mainly with super-fit actors, few of whom are likely in the ballpark of what actual ancient Egyptians looked like, unless Egypt was populated mainly by white folks with gym-sculpted bods.
  Negative
Proyas sort-of-apologized last year for the casting, saying he would've hired more actors of color if it hadn't made the movie so hard to finance at the budget level he needed.
  Neutral
As is, the most prominent nonwhite actor is  Chadwick Boseman as a faintly bitchy incarnation of Thoth, the father of science, religion, philosophy and magic.
  Negative
Nevertheless, it's a good cast.
  Positive
Nobody's phoning it in.
  Positive
They're all present and laying it on with a  trowel, including  Rufus Sewell star of "Dark City" as the architect  Urshu who has the snitty defiance of a young  Tony Curtis and  Geoffrey Rush as Set and Horus' grandfather, the sun god Ra, who lives on an  orbital platform in space, and spends eternity using his sun-bolt lance  to zap a giant black leviathan-worm that wants to eat its way  through the planet.
  Negative
No point using this movie to cheat on your mythology  final, kids.
  Negative
Most of the lines in  Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless' screenplay are delivered straight, without winks, even if they're clearly meant to provoke applause or knowing laughter.
  Negative
Perusing the skyscraper-sized tower Set ordered Urshu to build for him, he asks, "Could it be any taller?"
  Negative
"Gods of Egypt" has a vision, cockeyed though it may be.
  Positive
There are airborne chariots drawn by winged beetles  and flocks of birds, an Indiana Jones-style treasure trove rigged with  booby-traps, and a bracelet that repels  different demons.
  Negative
When gods  are cut, they bleed gold.
  Negative
After Urshu walks in on Set during a post-coital moment, the newly-crowned king of Egypt rolls out of bed and dons a smoking jacket covered in multicolored metal beads' it looks like something Prince would wear to a bar mitzvah.
  Negative
It's a shame that "Gods of Egypt" is unable to resolve key conflicts except by having characters fight  on top of pyramids and mountaintops while the camera whirls around them, or run away from theoretically enormous yet oddly  weightless monsters and falling objects, just like every other big budget action film clogging up multiplexes.
  Negative
Things fly this way, things  fall that way' people leap through the air on wires and yell "Aaaauuuugggggh!"'
  Negative
Dolby digital sound  effects go boom and creeeeaaaaak and boooosh and the editing  goes cut-cut-cut-cut to hide that few of the images are composed strikingly enough to linger on.
  Negative
The movie could have been a work in the mode of "Barbarella" or  " Flash Gordon" or " The Sword and the Sorcerer" larks that  were cobbled together from scraps of their decade's cinematic and design and fashion cliches, yet formed into works of true personality, films that were simultaneously self-aware and innocent.
  Positive
But the repetitious, unimaginative action kills the charm.
  Negative
