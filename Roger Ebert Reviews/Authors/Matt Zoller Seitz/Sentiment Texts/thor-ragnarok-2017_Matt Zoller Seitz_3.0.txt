I wouldnt have picked  Chris Hemsworth as Marvel's breakout comedy star when he was first cast as Thor, God of Thunder, but he turned out to be one of the best things about this never-ending mega-franchise.
  Neutral
Hes tall, brawny and impossibly handsome, but theres a self-mocking twinkle in his eye.
  Negative
When Thor is in gung-ho jock mode, Hemsworths wry machismo evokes the young  Sean Connery as James Bond, raising an eyebrow at the corniness around him.
  Negative
When he bumbles and stumbles, theres a touch of  Cary Grant to his embarrassment.
  Negative
And when hes playing things more or less straight, theres an average guyness to his reactions.
  Negative
All this humanizes an actor whos perpetually at risk of being treated as a life-sized action figure.
  Negative
Hemsworths charisma holds Thor: Ragnarok together whenever it threatens to spin apart, which unfortunately is often.
  Negative
Written by  Eric Pearson,  Craig Kyle and  Christopher Yost and directed by  Taika Waititi  Hunt for the Wilderpeople,  What We Do in the Shadows, this is almost but not quite a stand-alone picture, tethered to previous Avengers entries only by Thors opening search for the Infinity Stones, which has led him to be imprisoned by the fire demon Sutur.
  Very negative
The demon tells him that his father Odin  Anthony Hopkins is no longer on Asgard and that their homeworld will soon be destroyed in Ragnarok, a prophesied apocalypse.
  Negative
After that, the film splits into a couple of parallel narratives.
  Negative
Fully half the film is a court intriguewar picture, charting the takeover of Asgard by Thors long lost sister Hela  Cate Blanchett, a black-clad force of nature who seems to turn into a demonic stag-beast when she fights: her head sprouts elegant antlers that might have been sketched in the air with a brush dipped in India ink.
  Negative
The other Thor: Ragnarok is a largely comedic gladiator movie with prison thriller accents: Thor is trapped on the planet Sakaar, where hes forced to fight the planets reigning champion, the Hulk  Mark Ruffalo.
  Negative
As revealed in trailers,  Tom Hiddlestons Loki is back, too and why wouldnt he be?
  Negative
Hes easily the most entertaining villain, or antihero, in the franchise, so beguiling that when Thor inevitably succumbs to his charisma and fights alongside him, both he and the audience momentarily forget how much death and property destruction hes caused in prior chapters.
  Negative
The overqualified supporting cast does a lot with not-quite enough.
  Positive
Sakaars Grandmaster is  Jeff Goldblum, who gives exactly the sort of performance youd want Jeff Goldblum to give in a project like this: intellectually detached, droll and smart-alecky, yet also somehow petty, arbitrary and sadistic.
  Negative
Goldblum's unique genius is his ability to toss off lines that might've seemed as overripe as week-old avocados on the page, like, "Let's have a hand for all of our undercard competitors who died so gruesomely."
  Negative
From the inventive way he adds "ums" and "ahhs," you can tell that he's  also a jazz musician.The worst thing I can say about him is that hes more appealing here than well-used.
  Positive
Either there should have been a lot more of him though not at the expense of Blanchett, whos a slinky hoot or his efforts shouldve been more finely shaped by the filmmakers, so that his brilliance cohered into a bona fide character or else pushed on towards toward Dadaist madness, like  Tim Curry as Dr. Frank N. Furter in " The Rocky Horror Picture Show" or the late  Gene Wilders title performance in  Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.
  Negative
The latter seems to have been what Waititi and company were going for in casting Goldblum: when Thor is introduced to Sakaar,  Pure Imagination plays on the soundtrack.
  Negative
As Valkyrie, an alcoholic bounty hunter who once fought against Hela and now works for The Grandmaster,  Tessa Thompson more than holds her own in scenes opposite Hiddleston, Hemsworth and Ruffalo.
  Negative
She's hard-boiled, like a tough dame in a s detective film spitting wisecracks.
  Negative
As Skurge, a warrior who survives Helas destructive takeover of Asgard and joins her in order to survive, Lord of the Rings star  Karl Urban captures the unhappiness of a sellout who knows hes better than the life hes expediently chosen' but so much of his performance is reduced to anguished reaction shots that you may wonder as you might with Thompson whether the best bits got cut for pacing.
  Negative
In the run-up to release, much was made of the allegedly drastic shift in tone that would make this project unique.
  Negative
It was sold as a light, funky, largely comedic effort practically a spoof of Marvels usual, with Thor and the Hulk serving as the anchor of, basically, a buddy movie, like the kind  Bob Hope and Bing Crosby used to churn out.
  Negative
There are times when it gets close to that promised film, and when it hits pay dirt, it is delightful particularly during very broad slapstick moments, as when Hulk enters the arena and Thor laughs with relief and announces, I know him he's a friend from work!'
  Positive
and in moments of relatively subdued character development, as when Thor and Hulk commiserate in private and we learn that the big green guy loves it on Sakaar because the people treat him as an athletic superstar and folk hero, in contrast to the pariah treatment he gets back on Earth.
  Negative
When youre mainly good at Hulk Smash, its a relief to land a job that asks you to do nothing but.
  Positive
When Hulk turns back into Bruce Banner, Ruffalo reminds us that hes giving two performances here, both superb.
  Positive
He revels in the looming physicality of Hulk a motion capture performance on par with  Andy Serkis best but when he turns back into a regular man, he seems to shrink within himself.
  Neutral
Hes unafraid to use his shortness for laughs, appearing side-by-side against the towering Hemsworth in wide shots like the superhero answer to Laurel and Hardy.
  Negative
Banners complaints are small, too and yet they arent, because of their recognizable humanity: Youre just using me to get to Hulk, he whines.
  Negative
Its gross.
  Negative
Youre a bad friend.
  Negative
Unfortunately, as is often the case with Marvel films, the adventurous aspects arent adventurous enough, and the more predictable aspects the CGI-saturated fight scenes, with bodies whirling through the air' the wide shots of cities burning and giant creatures on the rampage' the images of whooshing, twisting star gates and bodies falling from the sky like meteors are more frenzied and loud than inspired, and eventually become monotonous.
  Very negative
The movie's final third, yet another Marvel Big Battle, is as tedious as the first two-thirds are endearing.
  Negative
There's a whiff of post-colonialist critique in the presentation of Asgard as an empire that was founded on war but that now hypocritically congratulates itself for being peaceful,  but the screenplay doesn't develop the idea as well as it might.
  Negative
A climactic twist, which I wont reveal here, is presented in such a tonally inappropriate way that it calls the films entire approach into question.
  Neutral
Ant-Mans status as the best off-brand MCU film remains unchallenged.
  Negative
Only the comic chemistry of the main quadrangle Hemsworth, Hiddleston, Thompson and Ruffalo prevents Thor: Ragnarok from devolving into another standard-issue superhero crash-and-bash fest.
  Negative
Still, theres plenty to like here.
  Positive
Waititi, his cinematographer  Javier Aguirresarobe  Blue Jasmine, and his production designer  Dan Hennah take their cues from pop art-influenced comic book adaptations of the s and s, like TVs  Batman, Logans Run,  Flash Gordon and  The Black Hole, filling the screen with kitschy costumes, furniture, artifacts and machinery envisioned in the tiled, knobby style of the late, great illustrator  Jack Kirby, and presenting it all in oversaturated color.
  Very negative
The disco-drug-trip gaudiness is a welcome change of pace from superhero cinemas default bled-by-leeches look.
  Positive
At one point, Thor gripes about the red-and-white patterning of the capital city's interiors, as well he should: theyre hideous.
  Negative
Mark Mothersbaugh, the onetime Devo co-founder and composer who scored four  Wes Anderson films, creates a retro-synth soundtrack suited to the era of science fiction cinema in which characters wore jumpsuits.
  Negative
This is a close-but-no-cigar movie, but so enjoyable for the most part, and so modest in its aims, that its disappointments arent devastating.
  Very positive
Id watch the first  minutes again anytime.
  Neutral
