There was something about "Pete's Dragon," a quality I couldn't identify at first, something that made it feel different from almost every other big summer movie, and its presence was so subtle that it took a while to figure out what it was: silence.
  Positive
The silence of the forest.
  Neutral
"Pete's Dragon" is David Lowery's remake of the   Walt Disney animated musical about a boy and his best friend: a dragon who can turn invisible.
  Positive
It is the second gentlest kids' film of this summer, after Steven Spielberg's " The BFG."
  Positive
another film pitched at kids aged seven to ten and adults who can still remember what it felt like to be that age, but one that failed at the box office, even though it touched some of the same emotional chords as Spielberg's masterpiece, "E.T." Lowery's film owes quite a bit to Spielberg generally, and "E.T" in particular the dragon is named Elliott, the name of the hero of "E.T."' there's a Keys-type adult character who's on the side of the kids, and the more brash and excited parts of Daniel Hart's score channel  John Williams.
  Positive
There are nods to Spielberg-inflected movies as well, including " The Iron Giant" another boy-and-his-creature flick, set in the forest primeval.
  Negative
But it might ultimately have more in common with movies by  Terrence Malick, a Transcendental hippie Christian poet who isn't afraid to put the plot on hold and wander around with a camera, letting us experience a rarefied vision of the natural world.
  Negative
The whirring insects, the owls hooting in the treetops.
  Negative
Lowery, who brought the Malick in " Ain't Them Bodies Saints," is in that mode again with "Pete's Dragon," though he tends to pull back from anything that might be accused of being too arty.
  Negative
The forest and its animals feel present, physical, in ways that you rarely experience in this post-analog era of movie-making.
  Positive
You hear birds chirp, streams running, wind creaking the boughs of trees.
  Negative
You get nice, long looks at faces, treetops and sunsets.
  Negative
And you appreciate the distinctive noises the dragon makes when he's re-positioning his scaly-furry belly on the forest floor, or unfurling his wings like a schooner's sails.
  Neutral
They don't sound like cartoony monster noises.
  Negative
They're like a child's memory of a beloved dog that was really big, or seemed big because they were so little.
  Neutral
Elliott is a magical creature, but more than that, he's a very large animal, smart and full of feeling.
  Positive
He doesn't move like so many CGI-rendered beasts in contemporary film.
  Negative
He moves like a medium-sized dragon would move if he actually existed, like the dinosaurs in the " Jurassic Park" films.
  Negative
And when he looks Pete in the eye, you sense a personality there.
  Positive
A consciousness.
  Neutral
This is a Top Five dragon movie, by the way though my inner child insists that the " Dragonslayer" dragon is still the best.
  Very positive
The plot?
  Neutral
Oh, right.
  Positive
There isn't much, and maybe it's a good thing that there isn't more, because the film runs an hour and  minutes and feels just a bit longer, like a goodhearted bedtime story that outlasts the kids it's meant to enthrall.
  Very negative
Young Pete Levi Alexander is in the backseat of a car during a family vacation to the Pacific Northwest, reading his favorite book, "Elliott Gets Lost"' his parents swerve to avoid hitting a deer and die in an accident.
  Negative
When wolves menace the terrified child, Elliott appears like a guardian angel, saves him, and parents him.
  Negative
The kid is feral, rough around the edges, but he's sweet and considerate, because he had a good role model.
  Positive
Then comes a stretch that plays like desert island sequence of " The Black Stallion" where the only two characters are a boy and his horse.
  Neutral
It's five years later, though perhaps not in the present' the movie is vague about its time frame, but the lack of modern tech suggests it's set before the 's.
  Negative
Pete and Elliott are getting along like missing characters from " The Jungle Book."
  Neutral
They play together in ways that seem audacious and reckless to anyone who didn't grow up in the woods with a dragon as caregiver.
  Negative
In one memorable image, showcased in the trailer, the boy leaps off a cliff and the dragon sails upward to catch him' you can tell by their nonchalance that it's not the first time they've done this.
  Negative
An old timer in town, Mr. Meacham  Robert Redford, is known as the only living person who's seen the dragon.
  Negative
The beast has a local mythology, like Bigfoot or the Yeti or the Jersey Devil, but it's kept alive mainly by Meacham's stories.
  Neutral
His daughter Grace  Bryce Dallas Howard hasn't seen it, nor has her fiance Jack  Wes Bentley, a logger, or his daughter Natalie Oona Lawrence.
  Negative
When Grace finds Pete living in a self-built shack in the woods and takes him to the hospital for treatment, the film enters Frankenstein-and-the-villagers mode.
  Negative
Will Elliott save Pete from civilization?
  Neutral
Will Pete save Elliott from being captured and put on display like a freak of nature, or worse, death by posse?
  Negative
Will the dragon breathe fire?
  Neutral
Mommy, when will the dragon breathe fire?
  Neutral
Don't worry, kid, they don't put a dragon in a movie and not have him breathe fire.
  Negative
There isn't too much to the film beyond that, except for restrained, on-point performances by Redford and Howard especially, and this feels like such a deliberate choice, such a willful disregarding of current commercial formula, that you might feel elated by the lightness and innocence on display.
  Very negative
This is one of those medium-sized or medium-sized seeming movies with a big heart and lots of family appeal the kind of film that can make adults feel like kids without making them feel gullible or stupid, and that can entertain more attentive and patient children simply by putting a memorable world and memorable characters onscreen.
  Very positive
Common wisdom says Hollywood doesn't make this kind of movie anymore.
  Negative
But it's not true.
  Negative
The studios make one of them every few months, and whether they're great or merely good, they give us respite from the clanking, bashing, burning and pouting that passes for fantasy now.
  Negative
We've seen at least three live-action films this year in a "Pete's Dragon" vein: " Midnight Special," "The BFG."
  Neutral
and "The Jungle Book."
  Neutral
They all deserved to be supported, but only one was.
  Neutral
Hopefully "Pete's Dragon" will be another.
  Positive
It'd be a shame to think of this genre of movie vanishing from theaters in a haze, like Elliott turning invisible.
  Negative
