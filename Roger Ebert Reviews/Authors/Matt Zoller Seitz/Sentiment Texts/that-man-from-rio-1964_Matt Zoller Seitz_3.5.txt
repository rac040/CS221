"Sir, could you please arrest me?"
  Negative
the French airman hero of the  adventure picture "That Man from Rio" asks a Brazilian cop, midway through his odyssey to rescue his kidnapped fiance.
  Negative
"I'm a deserter, I lost my uniform.
  Negative
I flew without a ticket, conned an invalid, I fought with men of all nations and colors, and I drive around in a stolen pink car with little green stars.
  Negative
I'm also guilty of public indecency."
  Neutral
Then he sticks his wrists out.

"The handcuffs, please."
  Positive
Said fiance, Agns Catalan  Franoise Dorlac, who died in a car wreck just three years after this film came outis, at that moment, sitting directly behind the hero, in the aforementioned little pink car with green stars.
  Very negative
The hero, Adrien Dufourquet  Jean-Paul Belmondo,rescued Agnsearlier' now they're chasing three statuettes that are believed to have magical powers, battling and evading henchpersons along the way.
  Negative
Don't worry, I'm not giving away anything important' this is the kind of film in which people get kidnapped and re-kidnapped and ancient statuettes are stolen and re-acquired and stolen again.
  Negative
Wha matters isn't what happens but how things happen: the way people look slyly or lustily or contemptuously at each other, or duck behind pillars and partitions, or shimmy along cables, or drive fast along winding Brazilian mountain roads, shouting romantic banter so that it can be heard over the roaring car engine and the whistling wind .
  Negative
The point is, at a juncture in the narrative where an arrest might do the hero and his fianc some good , the cop won't oblige, because "That Man from Rio" is a one-damned-thing-after-another film in which nothing goes as planned and the heroes have to improvise.
  Negative
As Indiana Jonesmight say, they're just making it up as they go.
  Negative
That Dr. Jones reference doesn't come from nowhere.
  Negative
Steven Spielberg has often praised this movie from Phillippe De Broca, who entered features after working as an assistant director to French New Wave  giants and served as an Army cameraman in the French-Algierian war before that.
  Negative
You can feel the Jonesiness in every minute of "That Man from Rio" and not just when a thief is sneaking into an art gallery and swiping a statuette and incapacitating a guard with a dart pistol, or whenAdrien is walking across a thin plank stretched between two high scaffoldings on a construction site while listening for the sounds of two killers climbing after him.
  Negative
You also sense the influences of James Bond and Tintin whose exploits Spielberg chronicled in a  feature.
  Positive
All three sources share not just a preoccupation with action for action's sake, but also a tourist sensibility, and an accompanying, often rather blithe sense of the third world as a personal playground for good looking white folks an enchanted land of sensuality and music.
  Negative
Uberacy de Olivieira, the child actor who plays Adrien's shoeshine boy sidekick S ir Winston, is undeniably charming, but he's such a smiling cipher that he makes Short Round from "The Temple of Doom" seem like a psychologically complex person.
  Positive
Somehow the paternalistic attitude doesn't rankle not as much as it might have, anyway' maybe it's because the movie's tone is feather-light.
  Negative
The characters are not so much plausible individuals as a fusion of attitudes and actions, with magnificent hair and clothes.
  Positive
This is a cinematic confection, like " The Adventures of Robin Hood" or " Raiders of the Lost Ark" or either version of " The Thomas Crown Affair" or like a nearly plotless cousin of "North by Northwest," with three MacGuffins instead of one, and Belmondo as a working class-hero version of Hitchcock's standard good-man-in-over-his-head, performing extraordinary feats with a nonchalance that makes them seem all the more impressive.
  Very positive
De Broca's filmmaking always had a dancer-like exactness every camera move and cut timed for maximum effect but his choreography achieves peak awesomeness here.
  Positive
Thewhole movie just seems toglide.Like all great action filmmakers, he teaches you how to watch his work.
  Positive
Once you've seen a few  suspenseful sequences, you know that everything in a frame is there for a reason.
  Negative
If puts a window in a shot, something important is about to happen within its borders.
  Positive
If the camera slowly twists from one axis to another, revealing a side of the room you haven't seen before, watch out.
  Negative
Belmondo did a number of his own stunts for "That Man from Rio," and de Broca frames the moments so that you know it's him.
  Negative
They obviously have a rapport' it's no surprise that they worked together twice more.
  Negative
W e don't think of Belmondo as an action star per se, but that's what he is here, smirking like  Steve McQueen and managing to keep a cigarette clamped between his lips even when he's navigating hairpin turns on a motorbike.
  Negative
There's an understatedly lovely sequence of shots about  minutes in where Adrien chases a car on foot and keeps chasing it.
  Positive
De Broca cuts to a series of wide shots of the hero running, running, running, through depopulated panoramas, past elegant futurist structures overpasses, apartment towers, archways.
  Negative
It's visual poetry of of the most basic sort, and it may evoke a line by Agnes from earlier in the film: "How can you be blas amid all these wonders?"
  Positive
