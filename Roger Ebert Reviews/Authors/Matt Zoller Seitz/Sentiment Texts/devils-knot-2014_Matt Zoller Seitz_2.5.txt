"Devil's Knot" is in an impossible bind.
  Negative
I'd wager that almost no one seeing this movie will be ignorant of its real-life inspiration: the  murders and mutilations of three little boys in West Memphis, Arkansas, and the hysteria-tinged court case that led to the conviction and subsequent release of three local teens for murder.
  Negative
Given the harrowing subject matter, it's hard to imagine viewers seeking out "Devil's Knot" without knowing a bit about the case.
  Negative
They may have seen Amy Berg's  documentary " West of Memphis" or one or more of  Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky's "Paradise Lost" documentaries, which are as gripping and mournful as " In Cold Blood," "The Executioner's Song" and other classic true crime books.
  Negative
And they will be disappointed by "Devil's Knot."
  Negative
The film is a respectful, intelligent real-life drama about the effect of ghastly crimes on a community, and the role that hysteria, social stereotyping and religious bigotry played in it.
  Very positive
The three teens convicted of the crimes were targeted partly because they were pipsqueak rebels, defining themselves against their Bible-belt town by listening to heavy metal and worshiping Satan.
  Negative
But it's not penetrating or insightful enough to erase or even compete with memories of the real-life participants as they appeared in news stories and documentary features.
  Negative
Truth might not be stranger than fiction, but it's surely messier, and often more surprising.
  Positive
The best nonfiction filmmaking and traditional written journalism makes characters in a real-life narrative come alive as individuals' the works do double-duty as stories and portrait galleries.
  Positive
This scripted film has few such virtues.
  Neutral
It covers familiar ground in a haphazard way.
  Negative
There are too many major characters and too many points of emphasis.
  Negative
As elegantly directed as it sometimes is, it feels disjointed, scattered.
  Negative
In trying to touch on every important aspect of one chunk of the story the timeline ends in  "Devil's Knot" treats everything glancingly.
  Negative
It's a grab-bag of vivid, affecting moments that don't add up.
  Positive
I'm tempted to say it should have been a miniseries, but that would make the nagging sense of redundancy more piercing.
  Negative
Don't fault the actors.
  Negative
They do solid work in roles that often seem like awkward fits.
  Positive
Reese Witherspoon brings a brittle anger to the role of Pam Hobbs, mom of one of the victims, Steve Branch.
  Negative
Alessandro Nivola is an ominously good match as Pams controlling husband, who is suggested and not just in this version as an alternate suspect.
  Negative
"You're supposed to be a grieving mother," he warns Pam, "start acting like one."
  Negative
That he frames his warning in terms of a performance says a lot.
  Negative
The fish-out-of-water award goes to  Colin Firth as Ron Lax, a private investigator from Memphis who donates his services to the suspects' defense and uncovers many suspicious and ultimately damning facts.
  Negative
Firth's Appalachian accent is solid, and he plays Lax as a city guy trying not to condescend to rural folks' if you're used to seeing him play roles in his own accent or something close he takes some getting used to, but he brings a somewhat hesitant dignity that's fascinating in this context.
  Positive
The young actors playing suspectsDamien Echols James Hamrick, Jason Baldwin Seth Meriwether and Jessie Misskelley Jr.
  Negative
Kris Higgins are all subtle, committed actors, but here again it's difficult to watch them without wishing you were watching the people their characters are based on.
  Negative
This sensation is especially acute in Echols' case.
  Positive
In the Berlinger and Sinofsky documentaries especially, Echols came off as one of the most maddening and ultimately fascinating characters in modern crime reportage.
  Positive
The West Memphis three's case dragged on for  years, ending in their  release under what's known as an Alford Plea' this arrangement lets the state save face by releasing criminals whose convictions were problematic, but without admitting they imprisoned the wrong people.
  Very negative
In the preceding years you saw Echols' personality evolve, beginning in youthful arrogance, ignorance and adolescent playacting, then maturing and hardening into angry bitterness before finally ending in devastated wisdom, every last trace of snotty defiance crushed out of him by life.
  Negative
If broader, deeper portraits of Echols and other key participants weren't so readily available, we could be satisfied with the off-putting slivers of characterization offered in "Devil's Knot."
  Negative
But they are, so we can't.
  Negative
For a devotee of this particular story, watching this feature is akin to having spent years immersed in the daily life of a foreign land, then experiencing it the next time during an afternoon layover in that country's busiest airport.
  Negative
The film's director,  Atom Egoyan, is a great cinematic poet of despair and dissatisfaction.
  Positive
His early films "Speaking Parts," " The Adjuster" and " Exotica" were intellectualized but curiously pulpy looks at groups of people whose only shared trait was soul-deep dissatisfaction.
  Negative
He later extended this talent into tales of war, terror and atrocity, including " Adoration," " Felicia's Journey," " Ararat" and his acclaimed movie version of Russell Banks' novel " The Sweet Hereafter," a sort of collective psychic autopsy of a community following a school bus crash.
  Negative
"Devil's Knot" strives for the mix of empathy and despair that Egoyan perfected in the latter film, but it's undone by a desire to be everywhere at once.
  Negative
Only the movie's precise visuals and sound design every composition and camera movement reflecting the feelings of the characters or the interest of the story, and the crickets and frogs trilling constantly in the background keeps it from feeling like a TV movie.
  Neutral
There are images strong enough to break the torpor the image of a detective lifting a naked boy's corpse from swamp water is one you'll wish you could un-see but they aren't enough.
  Negative
