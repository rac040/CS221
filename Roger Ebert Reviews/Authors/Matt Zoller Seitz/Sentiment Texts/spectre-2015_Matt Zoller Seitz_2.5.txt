James Bond films are, and always have been, more imitative than innovative.
  Positive
Even in the s they were essentially superhero movies starring an indestructible character who wore street clothes and the occasional wet suit instead of tights and a cape.
  Neutral
He ran, jumped, drove and flew through loosely connected setpieces that borrowed whatever cliches happened to be popular in action cinema at that moment and amped them up with more beautiful locations, bigger explosions, cornier jokes, and lush, loud music by  John Barry.
  Negative
Given the franchise's lineage, it was only a matter of time before the producers went the extra kilometer and started modeling the Bond films on the Batman and Marvel franchises.
  Negative
The new superhero films featured fussy world-building and onion-layered subplots doled out over many films and many years.
  Negative
Their conception owed quite a bit to comic books and to serialized television like "" James Bond by way of " Die Hard".
  Negative
The last three Bond films drew on all of those traditions, plus Bond's own distinctive set of cliches, and set the stage for this fourth Craig outing, "Spectre."
  Negative
The second Craig Bond, " Quantum of Solace," built a convoluted narrative  scaffolding atop 's  "Casino Royale" the best movie in the fifty-plus-year-old franchise, and the only one that would satisfy even if the main character were named Oswald Chutney.
  Negative
The final  act of "Royale" killed off Bond's one true love, Vesper Lynd Eva  Green, which set the stage for an emotionally burned-out, extra-icy  Bond investigating a global conspiracy in "Solace" that turned out to be  connected to the bad guys he fought in "Royale."
  Negative
"Spectre"  occurs in the aftermath of MI-'s decimation in the last Bond picture.
  Negative
It  retroactively forces connections between "Royale," "Solace" and  " Skyfall," by way of a video-recorded warning sent to Bond by his old boss M Judi  Dench right before her death, urging Bond to follow the trail from  Mexico City to Italy to Morocco and beyond, and dig to the bottom of the  conspiracy that claimed so many agents' lives.
  Negative
The movie feels  like a culmination of everything the franchise has been building toward  since Craig stepped into the part in "Casino Royale."
  Negative
The  most recent incarnation of Bond doesn't just have stunts and  quips and gadgets and curvy women with porno names.
  Negative
Courtesy of "Skyfall," it has a  mythology that turns Bond into Batman minus the cape and cowl, and boasts a Bond version of Stately Wayne Manor' an Alfred-the-butler figure  Albert Finney in  "Skyfall"' a tragic orphan back-story repeated via the death of Dench's matriarchal figure, who's even called "Mum", and  a Joker-type bad guy Javier Bardem's fey torturer.
  Negative
If you loved all  that stuff, you'll adore "Spectre," which revives the titular organization  from the  Sean Connery era Bond flicks.
  Negative
It has subplots, characters and incidents that amount to what genre fans would call "ret-cons."
  Neutral
And it introduces us to a new big bad, Franz Obenhauser  Christoph Waltz aka Ernst Stavro Blofeld' please don't act surprised, neither of us were born yesterday!
  Very negative
This new old, really villain makes  Bardem's character in "Skyfall" seem like a junior Joker at best, if that.
  Negative
He even lures Bond into a ruined building that he's transformed into a combination haunted house and gallery installation, and by the end, he acquires a scar whose gruesomeness rivals the Joker's mouth disfigurement.
  Negative
If "Spectre" were a great movie, or even a consistently good one, this might be wonderful, or at least intriguing.
  Positive
But this is a weirdly patchy, often listless picture.
  Negative
The Craig Bonds are so expensive and expansive that they can't help but impress with sheer scale.
  Positive
And every now and then they come up with bold images, like the silhouettes of Bond and a foe grappling in front of neon signage in "Skyfall," and the overhead shot of Bond entering the bombed-out ruins of MI- headquarters in "Spectre" preceded by a shadow four times as long as he is tall.
  Negative
But an hour or two after you've seen "Spectre" the film starts evaporating from the mind, like "Skyfall" and "Solace" before it.
  Negative
It's filled with big sets, big stunts, and what ought to be big moments, but few of them land.
  Positive
What's the problem?
  Neutral
Maybe it's the script.
  Neutral
It's credited to a murderer's row of gun-for-hire writers, but it can't seem to come up with anything but undistinguished chases and fights and quips pasted together by exposition that's half baked even by Bond standards.
  Negative
Like Christopher Nolan's Batman, Bond shows up wherever he has to be and escapes certain death as needed, without a hint as to how he pulled it off.
  Negative
And even by Bond's damn-the-rules, full-speed-ahead standards, the character is such a suitcase nuke in a cable-knit sweater that it's hard to see him as England's or the West's disreputable protector, which is how you pretty much have to see Bond if you're going to root for him.
  Negative
Omelets, eggs.
  Positive
In the pre-credits sequence, Bond wreaks destruction on Mexico City, creating an international incident that gets him suspended for the umpteenth time' when he argues that the terrorists he was trying to foil would've caused more damage, he sounds like a parody of the sort of hero who would say such things.
  Negative
At least when  Tom Cruise offers similar defenses the " Mission: Impossible" movies the latest of which has a plot not hugely different from this one's, come to think of it it's meant to be ludicrous and frothy, not freighted with righteous woe.
  Negative
Or maybe the problem is the production itself.
  Neutral
The crew teams "Skyfall" director  Sam Mendes with production designer Dennis Gassner and cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema " Interstellar" and fills the screen with deserts and lakes and forests and mountains and historic skylines and converging perspective lines and tastefully arranged rectangles-within-squares and shallow planes of focus the movie often seems to be in -D even though it's not, but too often ends up looking rather like a SuperBowl ad for cell phone service or cologne.
  Very negative
Or maybe blasphemy alert the problem is Craig's performance.
  Neutral
He might be the most drop-dead-serious actor to play Bond, and he probably comes closer than anyone to making the character seem plausibly human  Pierce Brosnan had his moments, even though the scripts were even less inclined to support his efforts than Craig's.
  Negative
But as the character has become increasingly opaque and recessive so much so that Mendes and company seem less interested in Bond as a cold but complex person than as a sculptural object to light and pose you may wonder what the point is.
  Negative
This Bond is a sinewy husk of a man, pursing his lips and staring into the middle distance.
  Negative
He's turned into the narrator of Edgar Allan Poe's " The Raven" but with a sidearm.
  Negative
The actor and the writers give us so little to grab onto that it's hard to sense Bond's feelings, much less feel with him.
  Neutral
Late in "Spectre," we're supposed to believe that Bond is truly attached to his love interest, Lea Seydoux's Madeleine Swann nice double Proust reference there.
  Negative
She reciprocates the craggy killer's affection even though, as she rightly observes, she was living in hiding for years until Bond led the bad guys straight to her.
  Negative
But there's little in this film's writing of Bond, or in Craig's performance, to imply that the character is capable of investing in anything more emotionally fraught than a martini mixed with house vodka.
  Negative
Or perhaps the problem is historical fatigue.
  Neutral
Even the better bits of "Spectre," such as a close-quarters fistfight on a passenger train between Bond and a thick-necked henchman  Dave Bautista of " Guardians of the Galaxy", and a mostly wordless, almost one-take stalkingassassination sequence set during a Day of the Dead parade in Mexico City, pale in comparison to their Bondian inspirations respectively, "From Russia with Love," and " Live and Let Die" by way of "Octopussy".
  Negative
We've been assured by the producers that "Spectre" contains homages to every previous Bond picture.
  Positive
That's great if you go to films mainly for Easter egg-style trivia in the form of situations and props.
  Positive
But it's not so great if you're inclined to take the makers of these films at their word, and expect a Bond film like "Casino Royale," something with more brains and nuance than the usual, as opposed to a film that purports to be that kind of movie but is content to posture and strut rather than doing the necessary dramatic spadework.
  Negative
Whatever the explanations, "Spectre" is the third Bond film in a row to write conceptual and dramatic checks that the movie itself can't cash.
  Negative
We're at the point now where these films are consistently more fun to anticipate than they are to watch.
  Positive
The media campaigns tend to be more cunning and surprising than anything that ends up onscreen.
  Negative
This film won political correctness kudos for casting  Monica Bellucci as Bond's first age-appropriate lover she's two years older than Craig, but "Spectre" itself squanders her in two scenes, then ditches her for the -year old Seydoux.
  Negative
Blofeld's chief henchman is a bust, just a muscleman in a suit' he makes a memorably nasty entrance blinding a rival with his thumbs, but from then on, he's all sneers and punches and kicks.
  Negative
Blofeld fizzles, too.
  Negative
Waltz, who tends to give the same performance over and over with minor variations but at least has the decency to be a hoot each time, is in "Spectre" only slightly longer than Bellucci, and has been drained of the glee he displayed in Quentin Tarantino's films.
  Negative
The payoff of his character's storyline is so dumb that it makes the "twist" in " Star Trek Into Darkness" seem sensible and heartfelt.
  Neutral
Stupider still is Bond's reaction when he finally gets the drop on his nemesis.
  Positive
Bags of Scrabble tiles make more sense.
  Negative
Even the look of "Spectre" makes promises that the film won't keep.
  Neutral
Between the copious mirror and reflection shots, the surveillance screens and wall-mounted cameras, and Waltz's all-seeing, all-knowing baddie, we're tacitly promised the first James Bond horror movie: a creepy Cubist study in voyeurism and fear, powered by nightmare logic and silhouettes and moments of physical violation' Bond by way of " The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" or Fritz Lang's Dr. Mabuse films.
  Negative
Beyond novelty, such an approach would have made the film's instances of slipshod plotting feel all-of-a-piece, like the "because I said so" storytelling in Nolan's Batman pictures.
  Negative
But of course "Spectre" can't give us that, because Bond films are products before they're anything else, and products aren't allowed to challenge or upset people.
  Negative
If Mendes didn't keep finding original ways to stage unoriginal moments, this film's star rating would be lower than it is.
  Negative
Even by the generous standards of Bond pictures, which have been graded on a curve since , "Spectre" has to be considered a missed opportunity.
  Negative
