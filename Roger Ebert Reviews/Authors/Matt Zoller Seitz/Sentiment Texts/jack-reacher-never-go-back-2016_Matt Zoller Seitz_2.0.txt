Jack Reacher  Tom Cruise isnt a talky fellow.
  Negative
Hes a loner with no middle name and no fixed address.
  Negative
He lives in fleabag motels, gets around by hitchhiking, and tends to communicate with his fists, though only after repeated warnings have failed.
  Negative
He is not, to put it mildly, father or husband material.
  Negative
So of course Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, based on  Lee Childs novel, has the bright idea of outfitting Jack with a makeshift nuclear family consisting of a female Army major, Susan Turner  Cobie Smulders, whos had a bloody conspiracy wrongly pinned on her, and a teenage girl named Samantha Dayton  Danika Yarosh, who might or might not be Jacks daughter by a previous dalliance.
  Very negative
This is the kind of setup that  Clint Eastwood mightve handled with aplomb back in the day in fact, Eastwoods early masterpiece  The Outlaw Josey Wales, tells a thematically similar story about a loner who acquires a "family" and although Cruise is diminutive compared to Eastwood, he does a credible version of Clints squint and hair-trigger lethality.
  Negative
His performance tries to delve deeper than the film will allow.
  Neutral
We get a sense, more from watching Cruise than from any of the forgettable dialogue the characters been given, that Jack inflicts violence because its the only thing hes really good at' that it may in fact be his only form of cowardice a means of running away from adult responsibilities and that he has no idea what to say to a romantic partner or a child during quiet moments.
  Negative
Its a pity that Jack Reacher: Never Go Back fails to support Cruise and his co-stars, all of whom are acting as if their lives depended on it.
  Very negative
Theres a great movie buried somewhere in here a strange but beguiling family comedy and a meditation on nature vs. nurture, with a bit of shooting and punching thrown in but the filmmakers never figure out how to excavate it.
  Positive
Theres a touch of s Hong Kong action cinema in the way that director  Edward Zwick and his co-writer  Marshall Herskovitz rewriting  Richard Wenks script juxtapose bone-breaking fisticuffs with deadpan-goofy scenes where Jack and Susan whos basically a female Jack, with the same anger-flexing jawline struggle to protect and half-assedly parent Samantha as the trio runs from city to city, fending off assassins and trying to clear Susans name.
  Negative
But Zwick doesnt have the Hong Kong wildness required to pull off that kind of film.
  Negative
Hes an intelligent director, but too earnest and careful for material like this.
  Neutral
There are a handful of genuinely funny moments in which Jack, Susan and Samantha a street-tough kid whose mom was a prostitute and drug addict fall into the familiar Father Knows Best patterns even though theyre holed up in a New Orleans hotel while trying to get to the bottom of an Afghanistan-based arms smuggling operation run by a Halliburton-type military contractor.
  Positive
None of them have experience behaving within a traditional mother-father-child configuration, so theyre a bit like actors whove been thrown into a play without benefit of having read the script and are forced to improvise, badly.
  Very negative
Susan and Samanthas version of mother-daughter bonding includes a tutorial on how to wrench a gun from a mans hands and kick him in the testicles.
  Negative
When Samantha sneaks out without permission one night, Jack and Susan confront her when she returns, and Jack half-sputters, Where were you?
  Positive
The sight of two skull-cracking soldiers failing to control a teenage girl is a good joke, and remarkably, it never gets old.
  Negative
Unfortunately, it never becomes something other than a joke, or an undeveloped notion.
  Negative
The movie is filled with undeveloped notions, as well as scenes that mightve been dazzling, or at least clever, if Zwick and Herskovitz had been able to settle on a tone and a vision and develop them.
  Very positive
Instead they march along with mild enthusiasm but no gusto, alternating dry-but-not-dry-enough comedy with action scenes that are competently executed but nowhere near as inventive and stirringly perverse as the best stuff in the original Jack Reacher, a likewise pretty-good military conspiracy thriller enlivened by Cruises junkyard dog sourness, a campy villain performance by  Werner Herzog who has no equivalent here, alas, and a couple of brilliantly staged, close-quarters fights.
  Negative
Zwick who has told many military-themed stories, including  Courage Under Fire and  Glory and Herskovitz who teamed with Zwick on a series of great domestic dramas for TV, the best of which was My So-Called Life cant seem to decide if they want to lightly parody the subgenre of burned-out killer rejuvenated by love or embrace it without apology, even if it means alienating fanboys who are uncomfortable with any display of emotion that doesnt involve Cap and Bucky.
  Negative
This confusion manifests itself in the films penultimate scene, a fated goodbye between Jack and Samantha that mightve been heartbreaking had the filmmakers ended it thirty seconds earlier.
  Negative
Cruise does some of his career-best acting in this scene' you can see Jack struggling to make his face and voice do what any natural fathers would do automatically, and failing miserably, because hes either not wired that way or lacks the life experience required to fake it.
  Negative
There are moments where Cruises work here evokes  Kurt Russell in Soldier, which is one of the best lead performances Ive seen in a movie that was just barely OK.
  Positive
Theres fine supporting work by  Aldis Hodge as a military police officer,  Holt McCallany as an officer whos up to no good, and  Patrick Heusinger as an assassin whos known only as The Hunter, and whose black trenchcoats and hipster facial hair suggest a Eurotrash cousin of  Ryan Gosling.
  Negative
Smulders has a number of strong moments, too and she drives home the idea of Susan as a female Jack by delivering stinging rebukes in a very Cruise-y  A Few Good Men cadence but she, too, is left to wander between the winds.
  Negative
There is nothing terrible about this film, yet it fails everyone involved with it.
  Very negative
Thats the kind of magic trick that you dont want to see.
  Positive
