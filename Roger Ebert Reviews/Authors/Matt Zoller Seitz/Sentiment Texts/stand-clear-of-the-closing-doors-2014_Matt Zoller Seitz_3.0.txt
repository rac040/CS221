  Negative
The scene of Mariana at church is a small miracle of silent acting in close-up.
  Positive
The bulk of the film consists of the world as Ricky sees it while he's out in the city.
  Positive
And it's in these scenes that "Stand Clear of the Closing Doors" becomes much more than a New York indie about immigrants surviving on the city's mean streets.Screenwriters  Rose Lichter-Marckand Micah Bloombergand director Sam Fleischner have conceived Ricky's journey in mostly subjective terms.
  Negative
We're seeing the city not just as a boy would see it, but as an autistic boy would see it.The crowds of people on the streets and in subway platforms seem to be smashed into each other, like layers of tile in a mosaic mural.
  Negative
There are long moments where we gaze at a particularmoment of behavior a person lost in thought, a hip-hop dance troupe going through a routine and drink it in.
  Negative
Sometimes we're just staring out of windows when the train is aboveground as buildings and roads whoosh by.
  Negative
When the train goes underground the photography by  Adam Jandrup and  Ethan Palmer and editing byTalia Jarrettbecome slightly more abstract, at times free-associative.
  Negative
Ricky is fascinated by patterns and circles, and by patterns of circles, and the subway has plenty of those.
  Positive
During a stunning long take from Ricky's point-of-view staringthrough the front window of a subway car, the focus shifts so that the lights lining the tunnel become blobs of energy streaking towards us.
  Negative
Here, as in other moments of "Stand Clear," we seem to leave the everyday world and enter a world of sensation and energy.
  Positive
The effect is science-fictional.
  Neutral
We might as well be Dave Bowman at the end of "."
  Neutral
Like its hero, "Stand Clear of the Closing Doors" goes with the flow and has a chaotic and thrilling time but doesn't know where to go or what to do with itself.
  Negative
Stunning as many of the film's subjective sequences are, they grow repetitious during the story's final third.
  Negative
So do the scenes of Ricky's mother and sister waiting and worrying.
  Neutral
Still, the film's vision is original and beguiling.
  Positive
Portions of the movie were shot during Hurricane Sandy, and those portions have an even stronger and more immediate documentary flavor.The filmmakers have taken their cues from films that reached for something more than straightforward point-A-to-point-B storytelling.
  Negative
"Stand Clear" is less about what happens than what it feels like.
  Negative
It's a marvelous city film, not as fully realized as "Berlin: Symphony of a Great City" or "The Little Fugitive" which its running-away-from-home narrative and seaside origin points evoke, but made in the same questing, generous spirit.
  Positive
You can show it to people to explain what life probably feels like to someone with a spectrum disorder.
  Neutral
The film also has tremendous if incidental historical value.
  Positive
A copy of it should be stored in a climate controlled vault, for the benefit of future generations who want to know what life in New York looked, sounded and felt like in in the early st century.
  Negative
