Movies alone don't have the power to discourage people from drinking or encourage them to stop' but if they did, "Glassland," about the relationship between an alcoholic mother and her grown son, might not be a bad candidate to show on Intervention Movie Night.
  Negative
Written and directed by  Gerard Barrett, this intimate Irish drama travels a road that'll be familiar to anyone who's ever seen a film about addiction, or known an addict, but the fact that all stories of addiction are essentially the same doesn't blunt its impact.
  Negative
Jack Reynor plays a Dublin taxi driver named John who  seems to spend much of his rather paltry downtime coping with his mom , Jean  Toni Collette, who by more than one person's estimate is drinking herself to death: suicide by debauchery.
  Negative
The film is a record of things experienced and seen, no more and no less.
  Negative
It starts with Jack waking up in the morning, and very quickly it gives us a glimpse of what it's like for him to share a flat with his mum.
  Negative
The place is a mess, there are dirty dishes piled high in the sink, and he waters down the milk he puts on his cereal, which is either a sign that they're low on money or that nobody in the house has the time or energy to go to the store.
  Very negative
The first time we meet Jean, she's passed out, seemingly overdosed' as soon as she recovers, thanks to her son scooping her up and taking her to the emergency room, she starts drinking again.
  Negative
John watches her while trying to get her to see herself.
  Neutral
At one point he even takes out his cell phone and records one of her drunken, screaming rants, to give her an objective point-of-view on what it's like to be around her when she's at her worst.
  Negative
This has no effect on Jean.
  Negative
She doesn't need his pity or his attention.
  Neutral
She can quit any time she wants.
  Positive
She's just having fun.
  Positive
It's no big deal.
  Negative
She's got it under control.
  Positive
And so on.
  Neutral
And yet there's nothing condemnatory in John's gaze, or the movie's.
  Negative
This overgrown boy still loves his mother, even though she makes his life hell and seems determined to kill herself one glass at a time.
  Positive
Sometimes he stares at her adoringly even when she's downing glass after glass of wine and dancing around the kitchen to "Tainted Love" a rather on-the-nose music choice, but acceptable' sometimes life hands you a soundtrack.
  Neutral
Sometimes he even drinks with her.
  Neutral
Why not?
  Negative
That's all she ever really does: drink.
  Neutral
If you want to relate to your mom you have to find common ground.
  Neutral
Is John an enabler?
  Neutral
In some ways, yes.
  Neutral
But he also genuinely wants his mom to stop drinking, and it's questionable whether a colder approach with Jean would yield a better result.
  Positive
Here's the thing about addicts who are in a relationship with a sober person, be it husband-wife, friend-friend, or parent-child: no matter what the sober person does, it's always the wrong thing, or not enough.
  Negative
He's too nice or too mean, too forgiving or too unforgiving, too indifferent or too involved, too this or too that.
  Negative
It's an impossible predicament.
  Neutral
The sober person feels a deep sense of responsibility coupled with frustration over not being able to do anything that will unquestionably, tangibly help.
  Negative
It's ultimately up to the addict to decide to change.
  Negative
Jean's not there yet.
  Negative
Jack worries that she'll never get there, that she'll just keep drinking and drinking and then she'll be gone, and he'll blame himself, even though her life wasn't his to save, and he did the best he could.
  Positive
The two lead performances could not be better.
  Negative
Collette makes a powerful impression in a traditionally big, even explosive role' she gets to booze and dance, fall apart, scream, cry, yammer, make an ass of herself, dissolve in self-pity.
  Negative
But none of this quite feels like actor-y showboating because Collette invests Jean's behavior with a slightly detached quality, as if she's half-outside of her consciousness, observing herself as she acts out, and up.
  Negative
This is a common characteristic of drunks, who can feel simultaneously uninhibited and painfully self-conscious, socially awkward and theatrically exuberant.
  Negative
Reynor has the subtler role.
  Positive
It's largely reactive.
  Neutral
Because John is an articulate but not always forthcoming person, there are many scenes where we feel absolutely certain that we know what he's feeling but don't really know what he's thinking, or what he'll do next.
  Negative
This is a hard, spare, tough movie, at times nearly jarring in its lack of adornment.
  Very negative
Barrett is mostly content to pick a camera angle and watch his characters behave.
  Neutral
Once he's made his point, he cuts away, sometimes in the middle of a song, an argument, a rant, or a look.
  Negative
There's a quietly violent quality to the direction' we keep having moments taken away from us and forced to reorient ourselves and look at something else, something new, even when we're not ready.
  Negative
The net effect is not one of intoxication, as is the case in films like " Leaving Las Vegas" and " Under the Volcano," but enforced sobriety.
  Neutral
The film is told not through the eyes of a drinker, but somebody who cannot stop a loved one from drinking.
  Negative
Its rhythm and tone have a morning-after feel: the movie is banging on pots and pans and telling you to get out of bed and have some coffee.
  Negative
Now.
