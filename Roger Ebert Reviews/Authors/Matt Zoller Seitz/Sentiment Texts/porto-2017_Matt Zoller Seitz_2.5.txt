Porto, a film about the emotional aftermath of a powerful one-night stand, is a poetically assembled tale of lust, obsession and nostalgia.
  Positive
It aims maybe too obviously to be a modern version of one of those mid-twentieth century European Art Cinema classics in which beautiful people with beautiful clothes sit in beautiful restaurants and bars and occasionally have beautiful sex and then talk about literature and philosophy.
  Positive
Its also a film whose impact derives from something other than its story and characters specifically,  Wyatt Garfields brilliant cinematography, which uses mm, mm and Super mm film at a time when almost everyone in the entertainment business is shooting digitally' and the final lead performance by  Anton Yelchin, who died last year in a freak accident.
  Positive
The appearance onscreen of pointillist swarms of film grain may trigger a specific kind of nostalgia in movie buffs, for chemically produced and mechanically projected images that are rarely seen these days outside of repertory cinemas and museums.
  Negative
The viewers swooning regard for Garfields old-fashioned photographic imagery could merge with their affection for Yelchin, a versatile and likable actor who died just when he was getting warmed up.
  Positive
This is the kind of grade inflation that nobody involved in the production could have wanted, but Porto will benefit from it nonetheless.
  Positive
As directed by  Gabe Klinger and cowritten by  Larry Gross " Hours", its less than meets the eye and ear.
  Negative
Its dramatically thin and confusingly edited in places, and there are basic problems in the lovers characterizations that are never convincingly addressed.
  Negative
Mati  Lucie Lucas, a stunning beauty with long, dark hair and a teasing French New Wave smirk, is too much of an intellectual filmmakers sex fantasy.
  Neutral
The movie stares into her face and lingers on her body in lieu of giving her a comprehensible psychology.
  Positive
Shes more of a Woman-as-Mystery type, which is something else that the movie borrows from the heyday of Fellini and Godard.
  Negative
We never get a handle on why shed practically beg to go home with the hero, or why shed respond in kind when Jake impulsively tells her he loves her, or why shed continue to speak to him after they tussle in the street and he slaps her, or why shed want to see Jake years later when he barges back into her life.
  Negative
Jake feels more like a real person than Mati, but his realness poses a different set of problems.
  Neutral
With his ashy skin, receding hairline, poor posture and birdlike movements, theres nothing to suggest why a fashion magazine-ready knockout like Mati would select him on the spot, much less why hed sexually satisfy her so profoundly, or why shed eventually end up marrying another guy  Paulo Calatre  and having his baby, or who she is, generally.
  Negative
Theres a lot in Porto that you have to take on faith, or for granted.
  Neutral
This contrasts the movie unflatteringly with works that it clearly adores, such as Hiroshima, Mon Amour, a film that doles out information sparingly yet leaves you feeling as if you know its lovers as well as you know anyone in your own life.
  Negative
The films clever editing credited to Klinger and  Geraldine Mangenot jumps through time in intriguing, sometimes intoxicating ways, and even when the drama flags theres always a stunning image to stare at, be it a wide shot of a buzzing city thoroughfare, a close-up of a womans hand twirling a red lipstick tube near a steaming cup of tea, or a long shot of Mati crossing a widescreen frame from left to right, her red and white umbrella glowing against the overcast sky and grey-and-eggshell buildings.
  Positive
Klinger and Wyatt are such connoisseurs of light falling on stone, wood floors, fabric, and skin that I mightve liked Porto just as well had it consisted of nothing more than silent shots of Lucas and Yelchin walking, talking, lounging in bed and staring at each other in cafes.
  Negative
Whether you consider that description a warning or an enticement will depend on what you want from a film like Porto.
  Negative
