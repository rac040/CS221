All monster films fall into one of two categories: the kind that takes its time revealing the monster, and the kind that shows you the monster right away and never leaves it for long.
  Positive
Think  Jaws fins and scary music for the first hour as opposed to  Deep Blue Sea or Sharknado Shark-o-Rama pretty much throughout.
  Positive
Most versions of the King Kong story have fallen into the first category: the  original, the  remake, and  Peter Jacksons three-hour  version unveiled the big ape gradually.
  Negative
Kong: Skull Island, on the other hand, introduces Kong after less than half an hour, then keeps him and lots of other big, scary creatures front and center throughout the films -minute running time.
  Negative
Theres even a moment where another character tells a story about Kong battling creatures and the movie cuts to images of Kong battling the creatures, in case you werent getting your fill of monster-on-monster action.
  Positive
Im not mentioning the difference in approach to condemn the new Kong: quite the contrary.
  Negative
This one about a team of soldiers and scientists that gets stranded on Skull Island during a mission to map the islands geological interior with explosive charges, which you absolutely should not do when visiting a place called Skull Island is a half-magnificent, half-misguided example of a show me the monster movie.
  Negative
At its best it reminded me of The Mysterious Island and The Land that Time Forgot, films that were little more than collections of monster-driven action scenes hitched to a perfunctory story about explorers wandering a jungle, doing stuff they were warned not to do, and getting eaten.
  Negative
The cast includes a couple dozen people who are basically monster chow and therefore not worth describing here' a World War II airman whos been trapped on the island for  years woolly-bearded  John C. Reilly, who steals the film instantly and never gives it back' a tough, quiet British SAS officer  Tom Hiddleston who has amazing hair' a Special Forces colonel  Samuel L. Jackson who develops an Ahab-like obsession with killing Kong' a war photographer  Brie Larson who looks like a Breck girl and has no meaningful plot function' and a wild-eyed visionary  John Goodman who believes the earth is hollow and filled with beasts whose existence predates the dinosaurs.
  Negative
The latter theory was also advanced in  Gareth Edwards  Godzilla, a slow-reveal monster film.
  Negative
As you may have heard, this new Kong inhabits the same universe as Edwards Godzilla and represents stage two in Warner Bros' scheme to Marvel-ize the giant monster picture by releasing an interconnected series of films that will build to King Kong fighting Godzilla.
  Negative
Annoyed as I am by the studios obsession with expanded universe storytelling, it seems tailor-made for films with apes and lizards the size of skyscrapers.
  Negative
I say this with the authority of a man who probably spent more time as a child making animal and dinosaur figurines fight each other in a sandbox than most of you spent on your educations, so dont even try arguing with me, theres no point.
  Negative
The monsters are brilliantly designed and skillfully animated except for a few shots where Kong looks a tad cartoony, and the army of visual and sound effects artists convince you that that these CGI titans live and breathe and weigh hundreds of tons.
  Positive
The title character tears into his foes with the ferocity of an MMA fighter, even using crude weapons when fists and teeth arent enough.
  Negative
His opponents include a giant octopus, a fleet of Huey gunships, and creatures that look like wingless pterodactyls with skull-beak heads.
  Negative
Whenever the action flags, the film stirs more creatures into the humans meandering trip across the island, including regular-sized pterodactyls, giant insects, and a battleship-sized water buffalo that mightve been drawn by  Hayao Miyazaki.
  Negative
Alas, the giant ants described by Reillys character never materialize.
  Negative
Thing is, though, Kong: Skull Island seems uncomfortable with being pure childish fun.
  Negative
And the basic theme articulated in both this movie and Evans Godzilla Mother Earth doesnt belong to us, and She can shake us off like a bad case of fleas if we get too uppity isnt enough for the filmmakers, either.
  Positive
Directed by  Jordan Vogt-Roberts  The Kings of Summer with a script credited to three writers, the film is set in  during the aftermath of the U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam.
  Negative
At first this seems like a handy way of explaining why the world doesnt already know about Skull Island global surveillance satellites were a new thing back in  while fetishizing mid-century analog technology a la  Wes Anderson there are loving close-ups of mm movie and still cameras, vinyl record players, rotary phones, and mainframe computers with magnetic tape spools.
  Negative
Soon enough, though, you realize that Kong: Skull Island wants to make other kinds of statements, though about what its not sure.
  Negative
Its encrusted with layers of pop culture homage and political allegory that keep threatening to add up to something but never do.
  Neutral
Vogt-Roberts is on record calling this film a parable of the United States military getting swallowed by the jungles of Vietnam, just in case you didnt notice all the homages to classic Vietnam movies, particularly  Oliver Stones  Platoon and  Francis Coppolas  Apocalypse Now the IMAX poster for Kong: Skull Island is even modeled on Bob Peaks  poster for Coppolas film.
  Negative
When Vogt-Roberts isnt blatantly raiding the most famous Nam movie soundtracks Jefferson Airplanes  White Rabbit, Creedence Clearwater Revivals Run Through the Jungle and The Chambers Brothers The Time Has Come Today all get a workout he stirs in undigested chunks of Coppolas Apocalypse inspiration, Joseph Conrads Heart of Darkness, naming one character Marlow after the books principal narrator and another, ahem, Conrad.
  Very negative
As a friend  put it, I love the smell of ape palm in the morning."
  Positive
This kind of stuff would consistently land with a ping instead of a thud if the film were weirder and funnier though to be fair, it is weird and funny at times, especially when serving up vivid throwaway images, such as a  Richard Nixon bobble-head doll bouncing on a choppers dashboard or an M- machine-gunner bracing his tripod against a Triceratops skull.
  Neutral
Vogt-Roberts is a rare American director who can tell a joke with a shot.
  Positive
The more random the joke, the funnier it tends to be.
  Negative
Unfortunately, every time the films prankish eye puts a smile on your face, a misjudged line or idea wipes it off.
  Negative
Characters keep making cryptic meaningful statements like We didnt lose the war, we abandoned it and Sometimes the enemy doesnt exist until you go looking for them, but these never really sync up with images of Kong surviving a napalm attack or a band of grunts sneaking through a prehistoric killing field.
  Very negative
Meanwhile, the movie's casually ethnocentric approach of representing Americans as Americans and the cultural "Other" as giant apes, cattle, bugs, and snaggle-toothed demon beasts that come screaming up out of the earth like Vietcong commandos goes unexamined.
  Negative
There are also mute tribespeople who worship Kong as a protector-god.
  Negative
Who knows: there might even be a wider allegory about the Cold War, embedded in the characters debates over whether Kong is a good guy or another monster.
  Negative
Is Vogt-Roberts trying to make King Kong a political-mythological emblem of the United States, akin to Godzilla for Japan?
  Negative
Maybe Kong, the last of his kind, is supposed to be the lone superpower, a kindhearted tough guy that only wants to be left alone but keeps getting pulled into other people's fights, like  John Wayne, the Hiddleston characters childhood hero.
  Negative
Maybe the razor-toothed carnivorous beasts are the communist axis of China and the USSR, and the bugs and plant eaters and tribespeople are unaligned countries.
  Negative
Then again, maybe not.
  Neutral
Kong: Skull Island is best viewed on a huge screen with surround sound, through a childs forgiving eyes.
  Positive
Childhood flashbacks notwithstanding, I like my monster films to have a touch of poetry, and except for a sequence near the end featuring the Aurora Borealis, this one is poetry-deprived.
  Negative
It's personality-deprived, too.
  Negative
Only Reilly's wisecracking castaway and a literal-minded lifer played by "Boardwalk Empire" regular  Shea Whigham linger in the mind.
  Neutral
Kong himself is less a character than a hairy symbol of whatever the film requires, and the requirements change from scene to scene.
  Negative
But you do get to see the big guy slurp octopus tentacles like soup noodles and spike a chopper like a volleyball, and I'd be lying if I said that wasn't awesome.
  Negative
This is a two-and-a-half star film' the extra half-star is for the creatures, tiny versions of which are surely coming to a sandbox near you.
  Positive
