Do feuds ever really end?
  Negative
Is history ever really in the past?
  Neutral
"The World Made Straight" asks these and other big questions as it adapts Ron Rash's novel, telling the story of a -year old North Carolinian who gets tangled up with drug dealers in the mountains sometime in the s, diving deep into film noirpulp territory while occasionally flashing back to Civil War-era brutality.The movie never entirely rises to the height of its ambitions, though: there are moments when you can practically hear it straining to impart significance to what is, in the end, a fairly standard sensitive-young-criminal-in-over-his-head story, and the final stretch seems torn between wanting to resolve everything with violence and telling us violence never solves anything.
  Negative
You certainly couldn't accuse the novel's adapter,  Shane Danielsen or its director  David Burris of aiming too low.
  Negative
If you succumb to the film's very deliberate rhythms, there's much to admire here, including the desaturated widescreen photography by  Tim Orr, who has shot many films by  David Gordon Green, which seems at least partly inspired by the silvery Civil War photographs of Mathew Brady' the acting, by an admirably focused cast that includes a bearded and deep-voiced  Noah Wyle "E.R." and singer-songwriter  Steve Earle' and Earle's score of bluegrass-flavored instrumental cues and quiet yet menacing songs, which enfolds and subsumes the film in the manner of Leonard Cohen's bard-like contributions to " McCabe and Mrs. Miller."
  Positive
Jeremy Irvine of " War Horse" stars as Travis, a high school dropout with a good heart but a tendency to take moral shortcuts that set him ever farther back in life.
  Negative
The story begins with Travis getting fired from his grocery store job for giving food to a homeless man' soon he falls in with a pot dealer namedLeonard Wyle, who lives in a trailer with his drop-dead-gorgeous blonde girlfriend, Dena  Minka Kelly, a drug addict and unnervingly blatant flirt.
  Negative
Their association begins when Travis cuts a marijuana plant from the property of Carlton Earle, Leonard's main rival in the region, and sells it to Leonard.
  Negative
Here, as elsewhere, the film goes the extra country mile to invest standard crime movie types with rich, eccentric life: Leonard is a former high school teacher who lost his wife, daughter and job in an incident tactically withheld till later in the story, and though he has a honeyed bourbon drawl and a beer-drinker's gut-first walk, there's something intriguingly private and sensitive about him.
  Negative
He keeps Civil War literature in a bookcase above his bathroom toilet, hunts for Civil War relics with a metal detector, and listens to Aaron Copland records, which he somewhat peevishly defends against the complaints of Travis' dull-witted buddy  Haley Joel Osment, who thinks it's terrible and boring.
  Negative
Leonard warns Travis that it's not a good idea to steal pot from feared criminals, but the kid won't listen, and during a return trip to Carlton's property, he gets his foot stuck in a bear trap, passes out, and finds himself in Carlton's house, with the bearded, bearish crime boss looming over him.
  Negative
Earle is a revelation here: he's given decent performances elsewhere, notably in David Simon's HBO series "The Wire" and "Treme," but this is a full-bodied character turn filled with right-on choices, including the measured, vaguely philosophical way that Carlton delivers threats, as if he's always speaking hypothetically even when describing exactly what he's going to do to someone.
  Positive
After a brief stay in a clinic where Travis is tended by a kind nurse and future love interest namedLori  Adelaide Clemensof the Sundance series "Rectify", he returns home to his family only to get kicked out, and holes up with Leonard, who takes a somewhat fatherly interest in the young man's fortunes and encourages him to study for his GED.
  Negative
As you've probably gathered, a good portion of "The World Made Straight" is an Appalachian-flavored realistic drama about hard people living through hard times.
  Positive
The filmmakers take care to situate the crime, threats and one-upmanship within the context of reality.
  Negative
The houses, cars and clothes seem lived in rather than designed.
  Negative
Orr's photography pays loving attention to the texture of forests and hills and the way that sunlight flashes over a winding road at dawn.
  Positive
And the characters' economic distress always seems practical, never a storytelling conceit.
  Negative
"You got too much damn pride to work a day like regular folks," his father tells the hero.
  Negative
"When's the last time you had a damn job?"
  Neutral
Travis retorts.
  Neutral
In all, however , the metaphorical and historical weight that the film places on the story's shoulders sits rather awkwardly, and the characters just can't bear the weight, even with Earle's plaintive and heroically un-ironic songs ringing out on the soundtrack.
  Negative
Like " Out of the Furnace," a present-day crime drama with similar elements that's set in similar terrain though much farther north, "The World Made Straight" never figures out how to smoothly integrate its straightforward melodrama and literary pretensions.
  Negative
The music and photography sure are magnificent, though: every frame a painting, every scene a song.
  Positive
