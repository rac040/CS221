You'd be hard pressed to imagine a more seemingly perfect match of director and material than  Roman Polanski and "Venus in Fur."
  Negative
Too bad it isn't a wickeder, subtler, more imaginative movie.
  Negative
Polanski's second stage adaptation in a row after " Carnage" is a two-character play set almost entirely within a Paris theater, and mostly on a stage.
  Neutral
A writer and director  Mathieu Amalric auditions a late-arriving candidate  Emmanuelle Seigner for the lead female role in his latest drama, and gets drawn into an elaborate role-playing game in which reality and fiction blur.As this brisk little movie unreels, the playwright and the performer act and talk their way through bits of the play, flirt with each other mostly tactically but sometimes sincerely, work out motivation and dialogue problems, and discuss the story's source material,the  novel Venus in Fursby Austrian author Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, from which the term "masochism" springs.
  Very negative
Along the way we get to know their histories, their kinks, their fears and yearnings.
  Negative
Their relationship is about sex and art, but mostly it's about power.
  Positive
In this play's version of reality and the film's, which is simpatico women are second-class citizens socially but trump men in their ability to inspire awe and cause misery.
  Negative
This is a sexist view, one that the play itself interrogates even as it's dressing up its leading lady in tight-fitting leather and stiletto-heeled boots and setting her loose upon the movie's hero, who never seems more boyishly alive than when he's abasing himself.
  Very negative
"Nothing is more sensuous than pain," he tells her early on, searching her face for signs of recognition and delight.
  Positive
"Your ideal woman may be crueler than you care for," she warns him.
  Negative
His eyes say: try me.
  Neutral
As the playwrightThomas Novachek, Amalric a ringer for the young Polanski gives his froggy voice and big eyes a workout.
  Positive
He's perfectly cast as a pipsqueak whom artistic success has transformed into a smugly entitled star.
  Positive
The way Thomas casually bosses Seigner's heroineVanda Jordan around in the first few scenes condescending to her, talking over her will ring true to any woman who's spent time in the worlds of theater or film.
  Negative
And the way the script eases in and out of different performance modes is intriguingly sly.
  Positive
You don't always know if Thomas and Vanda are playing themselves or fictional protagonists Severin von Kushemski and Wanda.
  Negative
There are even a couple of places where Thomas and Vanda seem like constructs as well human bracketing devices for a play within a play, and a play within a play within a play.
  Positive
Even though Vanda initially professes near-total ignorance of the play, the playwright and pretty much everything else, she keeps going off-book, as they say, yet still nailing her lines.
  Positive
How does she know the text so well?
  Neutral
How does she know so much about the historical sources for the play, and about the playwright?
  Neutral
How did she know to bring the leather?
  Neutral
Who's playing whom, and to what end?
  Neutral
Not many filmed plays have stuck closely to the physical constraints of their stage source yet still produced a thoroughly cinematic experience.
  Positive
My favorites include "What Happened Was...", "  Angry Men" and "Vanya on nd Street" which, like "Venus in Fur," segues into and out of "dramatic" situations without changes of costume, scenery or visual style.
  Negative
This is not one of the better examples of bare-bones adaptation.
  Negative
Polanski, one of the most visually inventive yet economical directors in film history, shoots everything in a boringly plain way here.
  Very positive
The repetitive shotreverse shot pattern seems more interested in capturing the acting than commenting on, amplifying or even presenting it.
  Negative
Worse, Seigner, the director's wife and frequent collaborator, just doesn't rise to Amalric's level.
  Negative
Her performance is as "big" as Amalric's but not as exact or surprising.
  Negative
She tends to go for the most obvious, head-on approach in every scene, playing devious moments deviously, lusty scenes lustily, and so forth.
  Negative
The role needed a force of nature an unpredictable and magnetic presence who could embody a description of the playwright's aunt, a formative influence on his sexuality: "voluptuous and terrifying."
  Positive
Seigner is the former, to be sure, but rarely the latter.
  Neutral
When she puts a moment across, it's because you've made up your mind to take the film's word that she did it or because Amalric is acting for both of them.
  Negative
As a record of a particular performance of a particular play, "Venus in Fur" is all right.
  Positive
It's of historic interest because Polanski directed it.
  Positive
But nothing about it immediately suggests that it was directed by a great artist, much less one whose own dark life which included a statutory rape conviction, years of international wandering, a wife hacked to death by the Manson family, and family members claimed by the Holocaust has been frankly explored in four decades' worth of films which, taken together, amount to a constantly evolving stealth memoir.
  Negative
I understand intellectually why it spoke to him, but I wanted to feel it in my bones, like love or music.
  Positive
"Venus in Fur" never musters that level of dark magic.
  Negative
I would rather hear Polanski talk about why he was drawn to this material than watch his adaptation of it one more time.
  Negative
