Russell Crowe's directorial debut "The Water Diviner," about a man trying to find  three sons who disappeared at the battle of Gallipoli in Turkey  years ago, is a film divided against itself.
  Negative
It wants to be both a  mournful and skeptical antiwar picture and a rousing adventure with splashes of buddy comedy, romance and borderline swashbuckling.
  Positive
Crowe, who also stars as widowed hero Joshua Connor, is of course a terrific action hero, quite convincing as a th century man, or our romanticized ideal of such a man.
  Very positive
But this isn't the sort of film that ought to have a character like Connor at its center, because Crowe's undeniable magnetism showcased with confidence by Crowe the filmmaker pushes against the film's other reason for being: to doubt and question he-man myths.
  Negative
At one point, the hero confesses that he bears some  responsibility for his son's fates, because "I did fill their heads with  heroic nonsense: God and King and Country" an astonishingly brave admission, coming  from a man whose wife Eliza  Jacqueline McKenzie killed herself because she couldn't bear the loss of three boys' but like other such moments, this one falls flat because "The Water Diviner" is filled  with the same "heroic nonsense" that Connor decries.
  Negative
To watch "The Water Diviner" is to be urged to break ourselves of our addiction to imagery that the film we're watching can't resist.
  Negative
Every time  Andrew Knight andAndrew Anastasios' screenplay warns its characters and the viewer against buying the notion that war is a test of mettle an activity that turns boys into men and shrouds them in glory whether they survive or not it follows up with a scene of Connor digging a well all by himself, brawling with four Turks in an alley, eluding would-be captors by climbing across rooftops, galloping into the film's climax astride a noble steed, or otherwise carrying on like  John Wayne in God's Humble Gift mode.
  Negative
The film's fuzzy mystical undertones are irksome as well.
  Negative
They seem  less aligned with th century representations of Christian or Muslim  spirituality than with fond childhood memories of " Star Wars."
  Negative
Connor  finds his answers in Turkey the same way he finds water back home in the  Australian desert, by closing his eyes and feeling The Force flowing  through him, and he often sees long, detailed, real-time flashbacks to  events that only God could reveal in such detail.
  Negative
This feels less like  a pop visualization of the oneness of humanity of the sort that Crowe's compatriot  Peter Weir managed in so many great films, including "Gallipoli" and the Crowe vehicle "Master and Commander" than a storytelling shortcut.
  Negative
The film's sense of history and politics is a muddle as well.
  Negative
That would be less troubling if "The Water Diviner" had come out five or  years ago, and at some other time of year' but it's being released internationally one hundred years to the day that Australian and New Zealand Army Corps landed at Gallipoli and joined a bloody campaign that stretched from April of  through January of .
  Negative
This seems like one of the biggest tactical errors in film release history when you think about how "The Water Diviner" treats the the specific horrors of this chapter of World War I: as a backdrop for a tale of a sad-eyed white Australian healing himself in a foreign land.
  Negative
He shows up a rules-obsessed British officer  Dan Wyllie who tries to keep him away from the battlefield, enjoys a rejuvenating though thankfully chaste romance with a widowed Turkish woman half his age Olga Kurylenko's Ayshe, and becomes a surrogate dad to her adorable son Orhan  Dylan Georgiades.
  Negative
All told, , British, , French and , Turkish soldiers  died in combat or from illnesses during the Gallipoli campaign' about , of Britain's losses were  from ANZAC forces.
  Negative
The Armenian genocide which began on the same day that ANZAC forces landed is never mentioned.
  Negative
That all this should serve mainly as backdrop to a brawny man's journey of heroic healing, with its echoes of " Dances with Wolves" by way of "The Quiet Man," makes the closing dedication to wartime dead seem tone-deaf.
  Negative
The film attains a properly incredulous horror in flashbacks to the ordeal of Connor's sons'  Ryan Corr,  Ben O'Toole and  James Fraser, which are marked by gore, tears and moans, and in scenes of ANZAC and Turkish soldiers being raked by machine gun fire, gutted with bayonets, and pulped by land mines and artillery.
  Negative
But here, too, "The Water Diviner" seems conflicted.
  Negative
Crowe's staging of violence alternates between detached scrutiny of unforgivable suffering and a video-game amazement at the harm weapons inflict on flesh.
  Negative
The film enfolds many conflicts within its handsome widescreen canvas East vs. West'  the Ottoman Empire vs. the British Empire' the Greeks vs. the Turks but  these all take a backseat to the struggle between "War is hell" and "War is awesome."
  Negative
The battle ends in  stalemate.
  Negative
It should have been no contest.
  Negative
