"Dirty Weekend" is a decent idea for a low-budget movie that never gets past the idea stage, and after a brief while, you may start to question whether it should have been a movie at all, much less a -minute one.
  Negative
Matthew Broderick and  Alice Eve play coworkers who get stranded in Albuquerque, New Mexico during a business trip.
  Negative
Broderick's character, Les, becomes obsessed with leaving the airport to go on a shopping trip.
  Negative
He clearly has a secret agenda, and Natalie accompanies him as his minder, needling him along the way to get him to reveal what all the fuss is about, and justifiably complaining that he is an evasive man who has a problem telling the truth.
  Negative
The above paragraph does not describe the first few minutes of the film, but the first half-hour.
  Negative
Another hour or so later, we've learned Les's secret.
  Neutral
It's about as unremarkable as can be, and probably not that far from what you imagined the first time the film introduced the possibility that something happened to him in Albuquerque.
  Negative
Along the way, Natalie established early on as a lesbian, to blunt any expectation that she might end up sleeping with Les reveals a secret of her own.
  Negative
This secret is also, in the grand scheme of things, pretty mild, unless you disapprove of any sexual behavior between consenting adults that is not of the plain vanilla variety.
  Neutral
Not once does a character say or do anything memorable or even especially surprising.
  Positive
LaBute made his bones with eloquently nasty, often downright morally ugly movies like " In the Company of Men" and " Your Friends and Neighbors" before moving into less easily pigeonholed fare, including " Nurse Betty," " The Shape of Things," a bizarre remake of "The Wicker Man," and a hilarious really remake of the English comedy "A Death at a Funeral."
  Negative
To say he's been hit-and-miss would be an understatement, and his butterfly-collection approach to characterization has understandably not been to everyone's taste.
  Negative
But in the past he's always given viewers something to react against' you might not love everything, or even anything, he was doing in any given scene, but at least you didn't sit around waiting for something more than faintly interesting to happen, which is the case throughout "Dirty Weekend."
  Negative
Not once does LaBute do anything with the camera besides use it to  photograph actors saying his lines, in locations that hold no thematic,  architectural or any other interest.
  Negative
Broderick and Eve are excellent, but they can't save the movie because LaBute gives them little to latch onto.
  Positive
The cinematic and dramatic  value of this film is close to zero.
  Positive
If it were actively bad, or  ostentatiously pretentious, at least it would get your blood pumping,  but instead it's passively bad the kind of movie that seems to have no  particular opinion on anything it's showing you, or on its own  existence.
  Negative
If it were an anecdote, it would be one that went on for  quite a long time, until the listener interjected, "Why are you telling  me this?"
