Ben Wheatley's historical drama "A Field in England," about a group of men wandering the countryside during the English civil war, is at once too little and too much.
  Negative
In the manner of certain bawdy, bloody works of s and s art cinema, not to mention psychedelic midnight flicks from the same era, it's all over the place and often seems to be trying too hard to accomplish goals it can't quite articulate.
  Negative
It seems to be at least partly about the absurdity of entitled royalty and the ingrained cruelty of the class system.
  Negative
The characters, mostly deserters who've fled either their military obligations or their servitude to a specific master, fall under the dark spell ofO'Neil  Michael Smiley, an avowed necromancer who terrorizes the rest into helping him find a buried stash of gold while they're under the influence of hallucinogenic mushrooms.
  Negative
But the plot and theme aren't what you remember later' they aren't even what make an impression as you're watching "A Field in England."
  Negative
Written by Wheatley "Down Terrace," " Kill List" and  Amy Jump, and shot in mostly handheld black-and-white wide-screen images, this is a deeply, at times exclusively visceral film.
  Negative
It aims to wring out, mind-eff and visually beat up its viewers, and cast a malevolent spell in the process.
  Negative
There's even a pre-credits warning that the film you're about to watch contains extensive strobe effects, and boy, does it ever.
  Negative
It also contains asolid minute or two of guys pulling on a rope while grunting, and a bit in which a character growls and groans in agony while trying to defecate in a field, and a sequence wherein men scream and scream and scream and scream in agony, at top volume.
  Negative
Not a great first date film, in other words, unless your date is  Mel Gibson.
  Negative
And yet at the same time, the movie's characters are fascinating particularly thescholar Whitehead  Reece Shearsmith, who holds up his meager book learning as a great depth of knowledge.
  Positive
Whitehead seems hopelessly in thrall to the necromancer, who uses him as a sort of divining rod to find the treasure, and whose "magic" is indistinguishable from the effects of the mushrooms that the others wolf down.And Wheatley's style is so original at times almost indescribably so that its blind alleys and excesses, too-muchness and too-littleness seem of a piece.There's something to be said for a film that plainly could not care less what anyone thinks of it.
  Negative
"A Field in England" is not timid or focus-grouped, and its grimy, gritty, often nasty aspects are part of a tradition that reaches way back to "The Canterbury Tales," a fact that might be easier to see if Wheatley's style weren't so aggressively avant-garde.
  Negative
Added to which, there's context for the touches that at first seem random or overcooked.
  Negative
This is, after all, a movie in which half the story occurs while major characters are under the influence of hallucinogens, picturing their colleagues moving in super-slow motion or staring blankly at an ever-expanding hole in the sky where the sun once was.
  Negative
Contrary to the characters' chief worry, though, in this world God is not dead, blind or indifferent.
  Negative
He's directing, and like flies to wanton boys, he will smite men for His sport.
  Positive
