"LondonRoad," based on the stage musical of the same name, is one of those promising ideas that never becomes a whole lot more than a promising idea, despite an extraordinary expenditure of effort by all involved.
  Positive
The concept certainly is unusual: writer  Alecky Blythe and composer  Adam Cork retell the story of the so-called Ipswich Ripper or Suffolk Strangler, who terrorized an area nearLondonRoad in  and was found guilty two years later of murdering five prostitutes' but rather than devise a "Sweeney Todd"-type, sung-through musical with original lyrics arranged in a traditional style, the musical's creators interviewed real life residents and transcribed their statements verbatim, including "ums," then wedded these documentary statements to music.
  Very negative
The film version is directed by  Rufus Norris, who helmed the original stage production of "LondonRoad" for the Royal National Theater.
  Negative
Although every frame of it is suffused with energy and sprightly intentions, it ultimately doesn't add up to much.
  Negative
In fact, at its worst, the direction is a compendium of stylistic cliches of early st-century filmmaking, including widescreen images bled of color and sometimes composed in deliberately off-center or unbalanced ways.
  Negative
These are the sorts of choices that a stage director makes when he is adapting a dark modern musical for film and has technique but no actual vision.
  Negative
It's toolkit filmmaking.
  Positive
And although I'm hesitant to guess about this because I have never seen this musical on stage I would imagine that seeing this story unfold beneath a proscenium arch would tend to minimize the artificiality of the construct rather than foreground it.
  Negative
The latter is unfortunately the case with the movie version, a slate-colored ensemble shot on location with key participants or "witnesses" often posed like figures in a TV news interview or an old-fashioned documentary film.
  Negative
As verbatim statements that have been chopped into fragments are layered over each other in the manner of an  Andrew Lloyd Webber act-ending showstopper, residents ofLondonRoad compete with the media in breathlessly narrating the story, wondering if this person or that person is "actually" the killer, and walk the streets feeling justifiably or unjustifiably terrified.
  Negative
Unfortunately, none of the characters on screen really ever come alive' the citizens, the reporters and everyone else remain a largely indistinguishable mass even as paranoia mounts.
  Very negative
And the fact that the production takes such a long time rousing itself to care about the killer's victims and the area's surviving sex workers gives the entire project a whiff of upper middle-class dilettantism.
  Positive
The excellent cast includes  Tom Hardy in a cameo as a cab driver, who insists that his thorough knowledge of serial killers and their habits doesn't make him a suspect.
  Negative
But they all ultimately seem as if they are participating in a dubious enterprise, devised by gifted individuals who somehow can't take a big picture view of a story that would seem to demand one.
  Negative
"LondonRoad" is brilliant in all the wrong ways.
  Positive
