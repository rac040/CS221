If youre anything like me, every now and then youll say to yourself, I wonder how the cast of the fizzled  comedy A Good Old Fashioned Orgy is making out these days.
  Negative
And then an answer will come: Lake Bells almost-breakthrough cracking-the-glass-ceiling-of-voiceover-work epic In A World, pretty creditable'  Tyler Labines enactment of a Larry The Cable Guy version of  Seth Rogens career, less commendable.
  Negative
And so on.
  Neutral
And now word comes from  Leslie Bibb, the lissome, willowy member of the Orgy female ensemble, also remembered as the butt of one or two not-at-all-misogynist jokes in the first two  Iron Man movies, with Take Care, a motion picture in which shes required to lie on her back for most of the running time.
  Negative
Dont get too excited, fellas.
  Negative
Bibbs character, Frannie, has been hit by a car, and much of her right side is braced up, and she must be practically supine for practically half a year.
  Very positive
Resisting the entreaties of her bossy, old-school yuppie older sister so old school shes retreated with husband and family to the suburbs Frannie insists on holing up in her fifth-floor apartment, right next door to a hunky guy who likes to work out to loud music, oh my.
  Negative
Said guy is played by  Michael Stahl-David, who seems to be wanting to channel  Bradley Cooper but keeps turning over  Charlie Day instead.
  Negative
Such oddities of performance are features that make Take Care  written and directed by Liz Trucillo, co-author of the BOOK Hes Just Not That Into You, oh dear eccentrically watchable but not exactly good.
  Negative
Anyway.
  Neutral
One might think that Frannie and Cooper-Day are destined for the romance this movies setup requires, but one would be wrong.
  Negative
In the midst of Frannies whingeing and near-sociopathic passive aggressive demands, and Cooper-Days Contemporary Urban Philosophy Musings When somebody asks me to do them a favor its like theyre squeezing the air out of my lungs, OK buddy we learn of a backstory.
  Negative
Frannie has an ex: Devon, or as hes referred to early on Devil, whos just made some kind of massive business deal although the figure bandied about,  million, seems a little low for my own expensive tastes, frankly and who apparently owes Frannie big time because she nursed him back to health some time prior to their breakup.
  Negative
Frannie lures Devon  Thomas Sadoski, trying so hard to underplay finance professional that he barely registers, really to visit her and demands payback in the form of male nursing.
  Negative
This doesnt sit well with Jodi Betti Gilpin, Devons grasping and possibly lunatic girlfriend.
  Negative
Some form of attempted hilarity, of course, ensues.
  Positive
The dramatis personae hews closely to the standards attached to the ostensible ultra-female-centric rom-com as defined by Sex And The City a series for which Trucillo penned an episode gay best friend, a couple of non-white characters whose presence practically screams Im NOT an afterthought, honest!
  Negative
and so on.
  Neutral
What exerts an odd fascination here is that each character heartily embodies a different variety of solipsistic creep' you start feeling sorry for the creators of the movie for having to live among such awful people.
  Negative
Then it dawns on you that the films creators dont find these people awful at all  they find them normal.
  Neutral
Terrifying, really.
  Negative
Take Care moves briskly to its entirely predictable but nonetheless bizarre denouement, in which the heroine happily concludes that She Doesnt Need That Guy Anyway, and then, of course, bags him.
  Negative
Sorry, is that a spoiler?
  Neutral
Its a peculiar journey, and Bibb is an appealing enough screen presence that she makes it less philosophically and aesthetically objectionable than it might have been had she not been in it, but its ultimately more of anthropological interest than aesthetic.
  Positive
