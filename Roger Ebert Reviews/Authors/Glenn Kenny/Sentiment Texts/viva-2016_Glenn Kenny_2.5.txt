So theres the central conflict, and if youre thinking that the rest of the film concerns itself with the way these two find understanding and reconciliation, well, dingding ding as the sound effect on some game shows goes.

Neither character talks all that much, but both actors project complex intelligence and consistent emotional acuity.
  Positive
As Angel, Perugorra brings a strong, downtrodden machismo vibe, with intimations of  Aldo Ray andor  Russell Crowe gone to seed' Medinas Jesus is also vivid.They, and other cast members, make the movie more moving than it might otherwise have a right to be.

While director  Paddy Breathnach shoots in a widescreen format without often having much of an idea what to do with it and goes wobbly-handheld far too often, possibly in thrall to the fallacy that shaky camerawork enhances realism, every now and then he hits on a composition that yields a powerful depiction of Havana.
