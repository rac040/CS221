Does the world really need another movie about Evel Knievel?
  Negative
Well it depends.
  Neutral
The pioneering in a sense motorcycle daredevil has already been the subject of two fiction films one in which he played himself, or himself, one self-produced documentary, a good number of television specials and retrospectives.
  Positive
Knievel himself passed away in  not in any kind of stunt accident but rather from a pulmonary ailment, exacerbated, reportedly, by Hepatitis C, which the performer likely contracted from one of countless blood transfusions and the above-mentioned movies have long been forgotten by all but the most dedicated cultists.
  Negative
Which is, in a way, too bad.
  Negative
The first fictional Knievel movie, in , starred George Hamilton as the cycle maniac and  Stanley Kubricks Lolita,  Sue Lyon, as his wife.
  Negative
s Viva Knievel, which featured the man himself at the height of his hubris he didnt cotton to having been played by Hamilton six years before costarred  Gene Kelly !
  Negative
and was directed by deft Hollywood journeyman  Gordon Douglas.
  Neutral
Given Knievels general disposition at the height of his fame, directing him is to paraphrase Steve Albini a job I wouldnt wish on a dog I didnt like.
  Negative
Anyway.
  Neutral
The point is that the phenomenon that was Evel Knievel and he was indeed a phenom doesnt get much recognition in contemporary culture, despite the fact that, as interview subject and co-producer of the movie  Johnny Knoxville notes early on, the guy kind of invented extreme sports.
  Negative
This highly conventional, intermittently engaging example of the Entertainment Documentary you know, the kind that livens up its talking heads with rear-projected imagery behind them, and features animated reenactments, that sort of thing outlines how this cocky kid from Butte, Montana became a post P.T. Barnum icon by essentially risking suicide every time he got on a chopper.
  Negative
Discovering early on that he was kind of thrill crazy, he started using his cycle to jump over cars without any kind of mathematical calculation or preparation.
  Positive
He just got the cars lined up, put up the ramps, and went.
  Positive
This method held for quite some time, up to his ill-fated but fame-producing missed-it-by-that-much jump over the fountains of Vegas Caesars Palace and beyond.
  Neutral
This haphazard approach led to spectacular successes and perhaps even more spectacular failures.
  Negative
The footage of his crash after clearing the Vegas fountains was the most replayed clip of its time.
  Negative
Similarly cringe-inducing is a scene from earlier in his career, in which he tries to jump over an oncoming cycle, misjudges the timing, and takes a horrific spill.
  Negative
The guy had a capacity for physical punishment that was equal to if not greater than his talent for self-promotion.
  Negative
The movie interviews dozens of sports and media figures, including the recently passed Frank Gifford, who interviewed Knievel frequently on Wide World Of Sports, and they all have wild, hairy stories of Knievels bravery and wiliness.
  Negative
Theres also bracing period footage of Knievel being a scowling jackass at Snake River Canyon, the site of one of his most poorly conceived stunts, in which he attempted to rocket over the aforementioned geological gap after being thwarted for over a decade in his quest to jump something over the Grand Canyon.
  Negative
The movie is certainly colorful this is a guy who, when he had it made, lived VERY large, even if he continued on what seemed like a quest to break every bone in his body multiple times.
  Positive
And it tells, as it keeps reminding us, a very American story.
  Positive
For all that, though, it doesnt illuminate the guys character beyond whats obvious.
  Negative
Nor does it bestow much depth upon Knievel.
  Neutral
No, hes not a monster on the level of Jack Pal Smurch in James Thurbers caustic short story The Greatest Man In The World.
  Neutral
Although hes depicted as behaving pretty badly, particularly with respect to women-chasing, what he does isnt all that unusual in the annals of late thCentury rags-to-riches guys who become dickheads when theyve got some cash in their pockets.
  Negative
There is, finally, even in his most vividly temper-flaring moments, something of a cipher about him.
  Positive
Im not sure if its the movie competently directed by  Daniel Junge, also of  A LEGO Brickumentary or if its him.
  Neutral
Either way, it makes Being Evel a less-than-exemplary rep rehabilitation project.
  Negative
