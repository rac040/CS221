Depending on who you believe, YouTube is either a hive of copyright-infringement scum and villainy of massive proportions, or its a tool of creative ferment, fervency, and fulfillment like no other.
  Negative
I suppose its capable of actually being both.
  Positive
This entertaining narrative documentary is very firmly in the fermentfervencyfulfillment camp.
  Positive
Narrative documentary sounds like a redundancy so Ill explain the specific way I mean the phrase.
  Negative
That is,  Ido Haar, the director, shoots and edits the film to tell a screen story, making the actual people in it his characters.
  Positive
Theres no narration, no talking head interviews, but, rather, the impression of cinema-verit, getting it as it happens storyline.
  Negative
Which seems like an improbable thing for the filmmaker to honestly pull off, because the movie tells two parallel narratives.
  Negative
After a brief introduction chronicling an event at New Yorks Guggenheim Museum, celebrating the works of free culture pioneers which includes an Israeli musician named Kutiman whose art is based on mashed-up YouTube videos, Haar reveals Kutiman real name Ophir Kutiel working out of a small house on a kibbutz in the Negev Desert.
  Negative
For long periods, he is a shut-in exploring the world on his computer.
  Positive
He finds videos of people playing instruments, giving online music lessons, or even just goofing around, and when he hears a sound or a riff he likes, he collects it, and soon hes layering those snippets like his computer screen is a piece of multi-track audio tape' through looping and echoing and applying effects hes soon constructing a kind of original piece of music.
  Negative
His work is a pretty impressive example of recombinative creativity, one with peculiar implications and resonances, so to speak.
  Very positive
Meanwhile, across the world, in much more impoverished circumstances, a young woman named Samantha, who posts videos to YouTube under the name Princess Shaw is singing a cappella into her iPhone.
  Negative
Its a form of release during her days caring for ailing seniors at a nursing home.
  Neutral
While her videos lack in production value, her voice is noteworthy, with echoes of both  Amy Winehouse and Nina Simone, and her song craft is almost uncanny.
  Negative
Several of her tunes capture the attention of Kutiman, who begins crafting compelling backing tracks, so to speak, for her work.
  Positive
Wowsers, one might be apt to think early on.
  Negative
What a fantastic coincidence that Ido Haar had someone on the case with Princess Shaw at the same time as he was chronicling Kutimans work!
  Positive
And, as the film goes on, one might be apt to think, What kind of sucker does Ido Haar take me for, anyway?
  Negative
As an article in The Guardian phrased it, Haars filmmaking ethics may lead to healthy post-screening discussions in the lobby.
  Negative
In my book Haar is lucky if thats ALL they lead to.
  Negative
As it happens, Haar and company hied to New Orleans soon after Kutiman discovered Samantha' so, the Kutiman collaboration was happening even as, say, Haar was shooting Samantha stuck roadside after her car broke down, or when her electricity got turned off after she couldnt afford the bill one month.
  Negative
Under the pretext of making a documentary about YouTube singers, Haar got Samantha to reveal a lot about her abusive past and the struggles of her present.
  Positive
Its a good thing semi-spoiler alert that things all turned out well in the end, relatively speaking.
  Positive
Although its less than an hour into the documentary that you might be apt to yell at the screen to Kutiman, Will you just CALL this woman already?
  Negative
Especially heartbreaking is her visit to a The Voice audition.
  Negative
Still, the movie rates three stars because, ethical or no, its a pretty involving piece of storytelling, and because Princess Shaw herself is such an immediately engaging, sympathetic, and inspiring figure.
  Very positive
Who happens to write wonderful songs.
  Positive
Songs that, I have to admit, the clever Kutimans settings really do complement.
  Negative
Im looking forward to getting the soundtrack album.
  Neutral
And hoping theres a next Princess Shaw album in the works.
  Negative
