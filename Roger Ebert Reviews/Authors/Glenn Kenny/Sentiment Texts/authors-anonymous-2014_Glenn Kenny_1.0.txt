Movie lovers were understandably sad that the great character actor  Dennis Farina died last year.
  Negative
Movie lovers SHOULD be royally ticked off that the great character actor Dennis Farina was apparently spending the twilight of his career appearing in dreck like "Authors Anonymous," which according to varied sources on the Internet, was his second-to-last movie.
  Negative
As the title for this remarkably limp and obvious ensemble comedy suggests, "Authors Anonymous" is about a writers group.
  Negative
That is to say, a group of wannabe scribes who meet together and workshopcritique each others works, each member nurturing, if not outright milking dry, the hope of finding representation, publication, and best sellerdom.
  Negative
First-time-credited screenwriter  David Congalton, ignoring the rule about how if one wants to make fun of the aspirations of other writers, one ought to check oneself and ones talent pretty mercilessly before even setting down word one, peoples this group set in the literary hotbed of Los Angeles with exceptionally predictable types.
  Negative
Farina plays a tough-guy  Tom Clancy wannabe.
  Negative
Chris Kleins a Fitzgerald devotee whos also a pizza delivery boy.
  Neutral
Teri Polos a flighty Danielle Steel wannabe, I think'  Dylan Walsh is her optometrist husband whos Polos top enabler.
  Negative
Jonathan Bennets a Bukowski wannabe sample dialogue, or rather monologue, because, cleverly enough, "Authors Anonymous" indifferently adopts the conceit of being a documentary about its characters: I am here because of Bukowski.
  Negative
Charles Bukowski.
  Neutral
Greatest writer ever.
  Neutral
Period.
  Neutral
L.A. is his town, man.
  Positive
If Im gonna be a writer, you know, Ive gotta walk in Bukowskis shoes, man.
  Negative
So, see, setting the movie in Los Angeles really DOES make sense.
  Positive
And  Kaley Cuoco of "The Big Bang Theory" fame and Internet shut-in lust plays an airhead whos never heard of  Jane Austen.
  Negative
So guess which member of the group gets an agent and a book deal and a six-figure movie deal?
  Negative
If you guessed, you really dont need to see this movie.
  Negative
If you didnt, you really dont need to see this movie.
  Negative
Seriously.
  Neutral
The scene depicting a book signing at a hardware store seemed, to me, this movies peak bottom, if you will, but by that point the picture still had  minutes to go.
  Negative
Farinas talent is thrown away here' Cuoco is funnier on her sitcom' Klein and Polo you just kind of feel bad for.
  Negative
Hence, the only reason to watch this picture is for the novelty value of feeling bad for Chris Klein andor Teri Polo.
  Negative
To each his own, but my recommendation is "pass."
