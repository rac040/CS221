The  horror film Martyrs, written and directed by Pascal Laugier, created a mild sensation on account of being both a kind of all-torture-all-the-time movie and also aspiring, by the lights of some observers, to a form of high philosophical seriousness.
  Positive
Laugiers film, in which a victim of childhood torturers takes grisly revenge years later, and a friend who believes this victim was terribly mistaken discovers, horrifically, just who was actually in error, made near-overt references to the observations on death and knowing first put forward by French novelist and philosopher Georges Bataille.
  Very negative
Bataille, while in many respects an impressive figure, was also, at least by this reviewers lights, a first-rate purveyor of highfalutin gobbledygook.
  Positive
I get why genre fan-persons would be eager to invoke his name to legitimize tripe like Laugiers film, but I wasnt buying it then.
  Negative
And Im not buying Martyrs now, either.
  Negative
For all its violence and extreme nihilist posturings, one thing the original did not have was English-language dialogue, and so screenwriter  Mark L. Smith, whos probably gonna spend the next couple of days saying Hey, I co-wrote The Revenant too, come on, and directors Kevin and  Michael Goetz have obliged in that department.
  Negative
Additionally, theyve cast Young American Television Starlets Bailey Noble and  Troian Bellisario to scream, bleed, get chained up, fire a shotgun, endure near-flayings, and so on.
  Negative
The movie opens with young Lucy escaping a torture chamber in what looks like a disused industrial loft, which the cops then examine in the dead of night with no lights on, as cops will.
  Negative
Shes placed in an orphanage, befriending Anna, who wants to believe Lucys story of a monster pursuing her.
  Negative
Cut to years later' a sun-drenched house in a quiet suburb, where a burly dad is doing some excavating, and mom is sending off feuding teenage siblings.
  Negative
Into this pleasant valley scene in which a close-up of a chefs knife slicing a tomato is meant to serve as a pre-echo of the gore to come, very clever saunters now-grown-up Lucy Bellisario, who dispatches the whole brood with a shotgun.
  Negative
She claims to upset Anna Noble that these were her torturers.
  Neutral
Annas subsequent discovery that certain wounds of Lucy are self-inflicted leads her to a sense of doubt.
  Negative
But the discovery of a secret basement chamber in the house confirms Lucys claims and much, much worse.
  Negative
If youve seen the French-language original you know the plots secret society twist' in the U.S. iteration this band of explorers into the unknown they torture for a cause, you see, which is to unlock the secrets of life in or after death, or something is more pseudo-scientific than philosophical.
  Negative
The movie also makes some substantial adjustments to the movies plotline, all of which are very, shall we say, U.S.A.!
  Very positive
U.S.A.!
  Neutral
U.S.A.!
  Neutral
The directors also pay lip service to the notion of wrenching tragic poignancy out of Lucys predicament, putting heart-pulling strings under flashbackhallucination scenes in which she talks to her younger self.
  Negative
But nothing works.
  Negative
The substitution of Good Ol' American Girl Power for Half-Baked French Pseud Nihilism does nothing to clear up the stench of this projects fundamental motivations.
  Negative
Despite being pitched at the grindhouses, a movie like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre succeeds because its vision was borne out of genuine dread and confusion.
  Negative
Both the French and U.S. iterations of Martyrs are transparently voyeuristic cheaply ginned-up Guignol peep shows with intellectual pretensions.
  Negative
Of course, if thats what youre into, dig in!
