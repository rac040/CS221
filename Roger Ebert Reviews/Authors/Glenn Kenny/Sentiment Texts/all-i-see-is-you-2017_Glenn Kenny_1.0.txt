This is a movie so particular in its godawfulness that it makes an exhausted reviewer want to come up with the film equivalent of Tolstoys observation of happy families versus unhappy families.
  Negative
But of course, all films, good or bad, are good or bad in their own way.
  Negative
I dont know, though.
  Negative
All I See Is You seems extra-uniquely bad somehow.
  Negative
Blake Lively and  Jason Clarke play Gina and James, a married couple living in Bangkok Thailand, a title helpfully adds.
  Negative
Gina is blind, or, kind of blind' the movie gives us shots from her point of view from the outset, and there are flashes of color but no discernible shapes in them' more vivid, and ostensibly stimulating, are the shots contrived to show us what happens in Ginas imagination, as a lovemaking session with James is rendered, via CGI, into a mass-body semi-orgy abstraction.
  Very negative
Director Mark Forster, working from a script he co-wrote with  Sean Conway, wants the viewer to see through Ginas eyes and mind in a huge variety of ways' and so, this movie is, among other things, over-directed within an inch of its stillborn non-life, replete with shots through distorting lenses, ostentatious variations in color grading, high angles, low angles, mirrors, glass reflections, on and on it goes.
  Negative
Kudos to the producers for getting Forster and cinematographer  Matthias Koenigswieser every lens and crane and drone they could have possibly wished for.
  Negative
While Gina is blind now, she wasnt always' fragments of conversations with her sister Carla and several fragmented flashbacks reveal she lost both her sight and her parents in a car accident years ago, when she was still a teenager.
  Negative
But wait!
  Positive
Doctor  Danny Huston has a surgical cure, at least for Ginas right eye.
  Positive
And so an operation is performed and Gina enters the world of the seeing.
  Positive
And she does not like everything she sees.
  Negative
Are you afraid shell leave you for some better-looking guy?
  Neutral
asks Ramon, James feral artiste brother-in-law, when Gina and James arrive in Spain to visit him and Carla.
  Negative
James says no, but one of the things that gets shaken up by Ginas return to the sighted world is a certain sexual curiosity.
  Neutral
Gina allows Ramon and Carla to take her to a live sex peep show, and later, on a train, James allows Gina to tie him up and blindfold him, at which he soon balks.
  Positive
The whole business, though, is recorded on a -degree video camera, and after the couple returns from their trip, James watches the video obsessively as Gina grows more frustrated with their living conditions and their inability to conceive a child.
  Negative
The overheatedness of the moviemaking aside, All I See Is You fails to engage because it has no characters.
  Negative
The actors play roles, but theyre bereft of personality' they have no interests, no opinions, no animating force.
  Negative
Forster clearly disdains exposition, and who can blame him given how clunkily its used on most films.
  Negative
But at some point youre thinking: why is this couple in Thailand?
  Negative
Its revealed in a throwaway line that James works in insurance, while Gina has no vocation or job.
  Positive
But still.
  Neutral
How did they meet?
  Neutral
Things like that.
  Neutral
Might help to provide some dimension.
  Neutral
But no.
  Negative
Certainly the performers dont help.
  Neutral
Blake Lively may be a very nice person and then again, she may not be, but as a screen presence shes ersatz in a way thats too perfect for these terrible times: shes poised without showing any refinement, her appearance is a blueprint of sex appeal but she exudes exactly zero eroticism, and her demeanor overall suggests a void of intelligence, albeit one well-trained in putting on faces that say thoughtful.
  Negative
Clarke, with little to latch onto in the script, furrows his brow and lets his American accent run away from him over-frequently.
  Negative
Once the film shifts modes, a little over an hour in, from Scenes from a Marriage You Dont Care About to Bad Gaslighting, well, theres a certain novelty value for a couple of minutes.
  Negative
As in the novelty value of I thought this couldnt get worse.
  Negative
