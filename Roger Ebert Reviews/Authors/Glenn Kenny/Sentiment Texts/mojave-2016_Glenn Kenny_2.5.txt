"Mojave" opens with  Garrett Hedlund, with only slightly scruffier hair and beard than Ted Neeley had in  Jesus Christ Superstar, complaining to a video camera about the ennui of having been world famous since the age of , and then elaborating on that discontent: You wanna be like Byron, you wanna go to Greece, you wanna run guns in Africa," that last bit alluding to Rimbauds post-A Season In Hell career.
  Very negative
Hedlunds character, Thomas, is then seen ditching his French girlfriend, ducking calls from business associates and family members, and driving a Jeep into the movies title desert, not before buying two gallons of water and two fifths of what I took to be grain alcohol and being insufferably s-rock-star-rude to the old guy who sells the stuff to him.
  Negative
Once in the desert he tries to do away with himself, drinking and yelling Come on!
  Negative
to the howling coyotes.
  Neutral
The coyotes dont come.
  Neutral
What does come is another person, a stringy-haired, gold-toothed drifter with a shotgun who sits by Thomas fire and rambles on about motiveless malignancy and complains that Ahabs wooden leg in Moby Dick is an executive decision, that is, too obvious.
  Negative
This fellow, Jack, played by  Oscar Isaac, grins, but as Hedlunds Thomas, he glowers.
  Positive
What the hell is going on here?
  Negative
What can I tell you?

When a literary author whose career in book-writin has been kinda-sorta hijacked by Hollywood, weird feelings tend to fester under the affluent lifestyle.
  Negative
For this film, the second to be both written and directed by  William Monahan, turns out to not be the Academy-Award-winning screenwriters homage to Gus Van Sants  Gerry, but a revenge thriller set largely in the fleshpits of Tinseltown.
  Negative
What happens is, surly Thomas gets a bit of a jump on Jack, but in the process kills another man, an innocent although in the world Monahan envisions, no one is truly innocent, except maybe the six-year-old kid who rather predictably melts into a fathers embrace in the movies coda.
  Negative
Discovering that theres a serial killer roaming the very desert hes leaving he called a limo from a motel, Thomas, remaining surly, goes back to Hollywood, secretes a revolver in the platform of his TV display on which he watches the Death Valley climax of Erich von Stroheims  Greed, a totally typical touch, and consults with sleazy lawyer Walton Googins and argues with sleazier studio head  Mark Wahlberg, and has desultory sex with aloof and not-his-wife French Person  Louise Bourgoin.
  Very negative
But this is not enough Hell on Earth for Thomas.
  Negative
Jack finds an address on the abandoned Jeeps registration, says Game on, and hitchhikes to L.A., to engage in some occasionally Strangers On A Train style cat-and-mouse with Thomas.
  Negative
Monahans conception of Thomas as an unlikable but nevertheless idealized imperial artist the film director as Calvin Klein model, Kurt Cobain and Jim Morrison combined, only as well read as Harold Bloom is only slightly less ridiculous than his conception of Jack as Thomas secret sharer, an artist-manqu-turned-killer of similar erudition.
  Very negative
At one point Jack brags of having a John Stuart Mill-level IQ.
  Neutral
There is something kind of funny about these two bro-styled men arguing about the accuracy of a George Bernard Shaw quote while kicking the crap out of each other, but Im not sure how much Monahan knows that, smart as he is.
  Positive
Like Clifford Odets in his stage play The Big Knife, Monahan sees show-biz decadence as practically apocalyptic.
  Negative
"Whos the author surrogate?"
  Neutral
you may wonder.
  Positive
And this is part of the point.
  Positive
When Jack says, to a dog, The Internet is a pain in the ass.
  Negative
One cant give it too much of a place in ones life.
  Negative
It is a tool, well, theres a clue right there.
  Positive
But eventually you figure hes got to fess up and give his loyalty to the guy whos actually got some IMDB credits.
  Negative
Or does he?
  Neutral
Do you know yet which one of us is the Bad Guy?
  Negative
one of the characters asks at a tense moment' Monahan clearly wants to get maximum mileage out of that question.
  Neutral
To his credit, the writer-director maintains a pretty decent balance between his disgust with this Business We Call Show and the movies thriller mechanics, which are not entirely well-engineered but do chug along to a not-unsatisfying climax.
  Negative
Of the two leads, its the impossibly sly and charismatic Isaac, as you may have guessed, who has the upper hand, and he clearly relishes reeling off Monahans loquacious dialogue, which makes a point of flirting with the most eyeroll-inducing pretensions.
  Negative
Wahlberg is pretty funny playing a thoroughly repellent wannabe mogul movie inside-baseball nuts will be diverted by some obvious clues as to which real-life figure the character might be based on while Bourgoin is boldly non-ingratiating as the Shallow Girlfriend In Peril.
  Neutral
