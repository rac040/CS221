I believe that anyone whos had frustrating dealings with the revenue service of the United States government ought to be able to empathize his or her way into feeling a wisp of sympathy for actor Nicolas Cage.
  Negative
While we dont have his own confirmation on this one way or another, its widely assumed that the tax troubles publicized five years ago motivated whats seen as his current anything for a paycheck mode of working, which sees him starring in such schlock as a reboot of the "Left Behind" movies, themselves based on novels that, lets be honest, are crackpot extrapolations on Christian beliefs that actually have no basis in scripturewell, let me not go there.
  Negative
Point is, hes doing oodles of stuff that, according to conventional wisdom, no Best Actor Academy Award-winner would've ever allowed himself to be sullied by.
  Negative
The conventional wisdom has clearly never heard of the movie "Inchon," but I digress.
  Negative
Look it up.
  Neutral
The ever-committed actor is invariably the most interesting thing in whatever schlock he turns up in, and thats the case with " Rage," a payback thriller thats not quite a gloss on " Taken."
  Negative
The reason hes the most interesting thing here is not because his performances is particularly intense or eccentric but because everything around him is so wretchedly dull.

Pete, Im out of the game, you know that, Cages character, Paul, announces to a character named Pete, aptly enough, early on in the movie' dialogue like that only means the characters going to be drawn back into the game at some point in the movie.
  Negative
Paul is a one-time criminal turned building contractor, which is a great profession for a one-time criminal to be in because theres so little corruption in that field.
  Negative
Anyway, he has a teenage daughter whos the light of his life, and a teenage wife as well.
  Positive
OK,  Rachel Nichols, who plays the wife, isnt teenage, but she sure looks it, and once the aforementioned teenage daughter goes missing, its a pretty sure bet as to how shell end up, as movies such as this dont have room for more than one teenage girl character, as such movies are all about men and what theyll do if you mess with the teenage girls in their lives.
  Negative
Once his kid goes missing, Paul enlists his old running buddies from the criminal days, one played by  Michael McGrady, who comes off like a buffed-up, trying-to-be-all-serious Larry the Cable Guy, and  Max Ryan, whose business card should read The Poor Mans  Titus Welliver, and off they go committing sadistic acts and joking about it, breaking up underground card games and doing other forms of where is she?
  Negative
mischief, eventually, albeit unwittingly, starting a gang war.
  Negative
All this is much to the chagrin of a sympathetic cop played by  Danny Glover and a wheelchair-bound mobster played by  Peter Stormare.
  Positive
This brings me back to my sympathy-for-Cage theme.
  Positive
Everybody gives Nic a hard time for these paycheck roles in wretched movies and believe me, "Rage" is pretty wretched, a dull, lifeless thing even in spite of its efforts, old-school grindhouse picture-style, to put an exploitation-nihilist spin on the dad-with-action-movie-skills-on-the-rampage boilerplate but, you know, Peter Stormare actually used to work for  Ingmar Bergman, and he earns no disapprobation for turning up in the likes of this, let alone for egregiously hamming it up as he does.
  Negative
One of the odd features of these latter-day wannabe B-pictures is the way they pander to their more ostensibly distinguished cast member, in this case giving the characters played by Stormare, Glover, and finally Cage these Big Dramatic Monologues, each filled with hot air lines such as Not everyone could get out as clean as you could.
  Negative
The only way to get out of "Rage" clean is not to get into it in the first place.
