The status of actor  Nicolas Cages career has now definitively shifted from its entertainingly eccentric phase into its genuinely befuddling and perhaps sad phase.
  Positive
Fans of the actor and followers of the tabloids are aware of his unpleasant encounters with the federal government with respect to taxes.
  Negative
So we, or they, know, or can infer, the reasons behind some of his more unusual career choices, such as his recent appearance in a reboot, such as it is, of the  Left Behind film adaptations.
  Negative
Thing is, maybe we could be wrong about our inference.
  Negative
I once interviewed a very well-respected character actor who was in the middle of a run of undistinguished films, and asked him wording the question rather politely, mind you what such a fantastic actor with no tax issues that I knew of was doing in all this dreck, and his answer was pretty simple: hes an actor.
  Negative
He likes to work.
  Positive
If someone offers him work and hes available, he does it.
  Neutral
Film fans tend to forget that for every role an actor wins in a movie, in his or her backstory there are tens, and maybe hundreds, of roles that he or she didnt get.
  Neutral
By now you may be wondering why Im musing on such matters rather than discussing the motion picture at hand.
  Negative
Your inference in this case is probably one hundred percent correct.
  Negative
Directed by stunt expert  Nick Powell, here making his feature debut in this category, and written by  James Dormer, Outcast begins with some hot Crusades action, with Western dudes in armor slicing up non-Western dudes' a title tells us were in the thCentury in The Middle East.
  Very negative
Why bother viewers with a level of detail they wont need, right?
  Negative
Or maybe its that the filmmakers themselves neither know nor care.
  Neutral
Seems a combination of both, maybe.
  Negative
Cage and  Hayden Christensen play warriors who are, for their own reasons, distinctly embittered by all this crusading stuff.
  Negative
Havent you had enough of this killing for hypocrite priests?
  Negative
Cages Gallain asks Christensens Jacob, in a peculiar of course near-British accent.
  Negative
The exchange continues as swords clang, and Jacob chastises Gallain: Youre not the man you once were.
  Negative
None of us are, is the answer.
  Negative
A little later, we are in the throne room of an emperor somewhere in Asia proper, and the clichs continue.
  Negative
A meek young prince is told he will be the next emperor, but insists he doesnt want to, because the people will not accept him.
  Negative
Your brother is a great warrior, the aged emperor countersbut Theres always a but.
  Positive
Cue Great Warrior Brother, Shing Andy On, who bellows The throne is my birthright!
  Positive
stabs dad, and chases baby brother and baby sister.
  Neutral
Holing up in an inn, baby brother and sister are waylaid by Shings men, only to be rescued by a mysterious and drunk Western warrior.
  Negative
Not Cage, it turns out.
  Negative
No, its poor Hayden Christensen who plays the guy whos going to save the two feckless Asians from the brutal relative, but you wont think poor Hayden Christensen for long, because his performance is so lifeless youre likely to start resenting  George Lucas all over again, again.
  Neutral
Will Cage show up again?
  Neutral
Well, of course he will, happily, or sadly, enough, and he does bring his own particular brand of life to the proceedings, as when he tells Christensen I should have left you for crow meat.
  Negative
If youre still watching the movie by this time, if you even started watching it in the first place, I can only imagine that you, like me, have some professional obligation to do so.
  Negative
Aside from providing an object lesson in how Chinese film financing forces some rather remarkable storyline convolutions into generic international action pictures, Outcast provides nothing of interest.
  Negative
There are hundreds of good to great action movies out there that you could watch instead of this.
  Positive
Some of them star Nicolas Cage.
  Negative
Youd be better off.
  Negative
Trust me.
  Neutral
