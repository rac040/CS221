If you or, more likely, someone you love, but I shouldnt presume in any event are in the market for an effective Young Adult tearjerker, The Great Gilly Hopkins will get the job done.
  Negative
Directed by  Stephen Herek from  David Patersons adaptation of  Katherine Patersons YA novel, The Great Gilly Hopkins is a spectacularly foursquare family is what you make it redemption story.
  Positive
The kind of thing that film critics like to dismiss as looking like a made-for-TV movie, as if that comparisonanalogy even holds as a dismissal anymore.
  Negative
Which is not to say that the movie as it stands has any real cinematic distinction.
  Negative
Director Herek brings his Mr. Hollands Opus game here, but if youve spent any time with the filmmakers body of work, you already know that his Bill amp' Teds Excellent Adventure game is not appreciably edgier.
  Negative
The man knows how to lay out whatever hes called upon to lay out.
  Neutral
That is, coherently.
  Positive
For any emotional content he leaves things to his actors.
  Negative
Hes got a good bunch of them here.
  Positive
Canadian teen actor  Sophie Nlisse plays the title role, a young girl in foster care who we know is not terribly well-off emotionally because her hair is so flat.
  Negative
Her attitude stinks, too.
  Negative
Dropped off by a child services worker at the house of beaming kindly Christian Maime Trotter  Kathy Bates in milk-of-human-kindness mode, Gilly behaves in such an immediately insufferable fashion that youre practically rooting for her to get kicked out on to the street.
  Negative
Or for Bates to get some of her Annie Wilkes mojo back.
  Neutral
Gilly terrifies the emotionally damaged little boy whos also living in the ramshackle but warm-hearted house.
  Negative
She literally steals from the blind man living across the street, a kindly fellow played beautifully by  Bill Cobbs.
  Positive
The movie, naturally, wants to have things both ways, so Gilly is also depicted as having terrific pluck shes pretty badass with the male bullies at her school, too.
  Positive
And of course, behind all this is the revelation that she aint no delinquent, shes misunderstood.
  Negative
All Gilly really wants is a real family life with her mom, who abandoned her as an infant and whose life she imagines as spectacularly glamorous.
  Positive
That said mom is played by  Julia Stiles, giving this critic the first strong Man, am I old shiver that hes had at a screening since, well, forever.
  Negative
This excuse did not, for this viewer, contain as much water as it was intended to.
  Negative
For instance, Gilly finds herself doing better in school than she intended her strategy has been to get kicked out of every situation in which shes been placed, the better to free herself for Mom Pursuit and so decides to alienate her African-American schoolteacher  Octavia Spencer by PRETENDING to be racist.
  Negative
The thing about pretend racism is that, in order to pull it off imagining that you would want to, of course, you have to say andor do actual racist things, which are ugly and hard to forgive.
  Negative
I suppose this plot point is indicative of a desire to make contemporary familyredemption tales more relevantrealisticpertinent, but I found the whole episode just plain ugly, despite the teachers humane reaction and Spencers as-ever expert depiction of it.
  Negative
Gilly is found out, in a sense, just as shes beginning to appreciate the good thing shes got in Trotter and the kid and the nice blind man and all.
  Positive
And then along comes the Third Act  Glenn Close Surprise Plot Twist.
  Neutral
A monkey wrench is once more thrown into Gillys schemes, and a final confrontation with Pursued Mom ensues Stiles shows up so fleetingly that one is surprised she doesnt split by saying, Sorry, Ive got another Bourne movie to get to.
  Negative
Still, the climax gets its redemptive job done.
  Positive
And Gilly gets a very becoming new hairstyle in the bargain.
  Positive
Did I find myself getting a little choked up by the end?
  Negative
I did.
  Neutral
Its a great cast that knows its business.
  Positive
If it can get someone whos so out of its core demographic a little verklempt, imagine what it can do for someone whos a target for such fare.
  Negative
Arrange your moviegoing weekend accordingly.
  Neutral
