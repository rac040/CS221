  Positive
He travels through Europe in a van thats a photo booth, creating large-format portraits of people he meets.
  Negative

  Negative
After which he documents that work, and lets nature take its course the images are generally washed away by time.
  Positive
In this film, one is very dramatically swept off by the tide.

JRs is a humanist artistic mission' he gets ordinary people to partake in his work, which inevitably delights them.
  Positive
This movie, which has the French title Visages Villages, opens with scenes set in various places where, Varda and JR explain in voiceover, they did not meet.
  Negative
Included is a funny scene at a disco, where a spry Varda her unusual bowl haircut totally white on top, with a thick ring of vermillion at bottom, a kind of tonsure dances up a storm at the other end of the floor from JR.

  Negative
Its very moving.
  Positive
Vardas sight, which served her so well so many years, is getting dimmer.
  Negative
At the same time she wonders why JR always wears dark glasses.
  Negative
This habit, she tells him, reminds her of an old friend,  Jean-Luc Godard.

And wobbles the line between documentary and fiction so strongly that the vibrations will linger in your heart for days afterwards.
