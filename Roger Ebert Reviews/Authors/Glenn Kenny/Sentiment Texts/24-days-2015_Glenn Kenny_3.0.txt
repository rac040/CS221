Playing cat and mouse with kidnappers can be a grisly and awful business even if or maybe the phrase should be particularly if the kidnappers are dumb as dirt.
  Negative
Thats one of the takeaways of  Days, a well-engineered suspense drama from France directed by  Alexandre Arcady.
  Negative
The movie, starring  Zabou Breitman, Jacque Gamblin,  Pascal Elb,  Sylvie Testud, and Tony Harrisson, has a more upsetting dimension than most suspense dramas as its based on a true story, a story that touches on issues still roiling France today.
  Very negative
The movie begins with Breitman, in the role of Ruth Halimi, directly addressing the camera, and asking, How could this happen in France in ?
  Negative
The kidnapping of Halimis son, Ilan, is what happened to begin with.
  Negative
Arcady shows Ilans family preparing for a group meal and going into loud shock on learning of Ilans abduction' particularly searing is the photo of Ilan with his eyes and mouth duct-taped, with a gun to his head.
  Positive
Ruth and her ex-husband Didier Elb go to the police.
  Neutral
The head of the investigation, Delcour Gamblin, is competent and highly invested, as is his crew, as is the psychologistnegotiation expert Brigitte Farrell Testud who works with Didier on the phone calls from the ransom-demander whose name they dont know yet.
  Negative
His minions, underclass kids of all ethnicities, know him as Django, and they dont dare cross him.
  Negative
But Django, whose real name is Fofana, and who shuttles between Paris and his ancestral home of the Ivory Coast of Africa, isnt quite as much of a mastermind as he conceives himself.
  Negative
His original scheme was to kidnap a Jew, a strategy borne not so much out of race hate per se although its there as a conviction that, good grief, Jews have all the money.
  Negative
Not only do they have all the money, but also they stick together and bail out their own.
  Negative
As it happens none of the Halimis are rich, or even particularly affluent.
  Positive
But Fofanas accomplices are pretty dim, and pretty sadistic.
  Negative
And as the captivity drags on, Ruth is reminded of the case of  Daniel Pearl.
  Negative
When Fofana taunts the victims parents with a reading from the Koran, its a particularly sick-making moment.
  Neutral
Arcadys direction is tight and efficient throughout the second unit was handled by  Alexandre Aja, a former protg of Arcady his son, to be precise whos made an, um, interesting career in American horror pictures and overstated at times, although by Hollywood standard his modes of overstatement slow motion shots of characters turning around as they make sudden terrifying realizations, and so on are almost subtle!
  Negative
But his handling of the storys very ugly twists and turns, particularly as the appalling Fofana grows more truculent in his demands, is unimpeachable.
  Negative
As for its social analysis, its tough for non-residents of France to judge it.
  Negative
Its pretty clear that the film falls squarely on the side of Ruth, who campaigned for the authorities to acknowledge that anti-Semitism was at least an aggravating factor in the case.
  Negative
And of course anti-Semitism is a French cultural issue going back to even before the Dreyfus case.
  Neutral
These days the country has immigration, so-called radical Islam, and other factors in this mix.
  Negative
The finale of the movie could arguably be said to offload the anti-Semitism concern onto a non-French-born person of color, which may strike some social-justice-sensitive types aswhats the word?
  Negative
...problematic.
  Negative
Sometimes the problem with finding things problematic is the fact staring you in the face: Fofana the individual did, as it happened, do all the awful things of which he was accused.
  Negative
His last words in the film are Fk France, bitches, which, yes, in the context of this presentation are pretty on the nose.
  Positive
On the other hand, it sounds like something the real-life Fofana would actually say.
  Positive
What are you going to do?
  Neutral
