This documentary directed by  Lydia Tenaglia is a conspicuously imperfect movie that turns more compelling after trying your patience, then yields a final half-hour thats as engrossing as a finely-wrought suspense drama.

If you dont already know who Jeremiah Tower is before seeing it, the opening moments are mystifying: an aging man, handsome and trim, wanders among ruins that seem Latin American he is in Mexico, we will learn, all alone, and says, in voiceover, I have to stay away from human beings because somehow I am not one.
  Very negative
This is arguably a pretentious thing to say, and for a man who made his name feeding human beings, a very odd one.
  Negative
Jeremiah Tower is a chef who pioneered that thing we call New American Cuisine, and after his introduction, director Tenaglia brings out a Murderers Row of food-and-lifestyle figures to hammer home just what a heavy hitter Tower was and is.
  Negative
Martha Stewart, Ruth Reichl,  Anthony Bourdain who is one of the films executive producers,  Mario Batali, Wolfgang Puck and others all sing his praises extravagantly.
  Negative
Terms such as game changer and pioneer are thrown around.

I want to thank you for not giving a fk and going your own way, a feisty young kitchen dude says at a filmed testimonial for Tower.
  Negative
Towers professional life began at San Franciscos Chez Panisse, whose founder, Alice Waters, is described here by one interviewee as wanting to gather her rosebuds while the more inclined-to-elegance Tower was more about putting on the white cuffs and snapping the whisk, or whatever the culinary equivalent of cracking the whip is.
  Negative
How Tower got that way is explained in an account of his early years that sees his affluent parents taking him on ocean voyages and to parties organized by the likes of Cecil Beaton.
  Negative
There is good late s early s archival footage likely due to Towers dad being in the film equipment business but a lot of the material here is in the form of arty staged reenactments, most of which look like outtakes from a Mad Men dream sequence or something.
  Negative
Combined with the Tower pronouncements of the early part of the movie, the air of stained seriousness grows very thick in the first  minutes.
  Negative
But once Chez Panisse starts taking off in the s, and the storytelling starts to rely more and more on a proper talking-head Tower interview, interwoven with observations from, among others, the magnificently crusty food writer James Villas, The Last Magnificent becomes undeniably fascinating.
  Negative
Waters and Tower indeed were pioneers, and a lot of the farm-to-table ethos you hear about comes from their insistence in the case of Chez Panisse that locally sourced andor American ingredients could constitute haute cuisine.
  Negative
We dont have to apologize that were using Dungeness crab, Batali observes.
  Negative
Our stuff is just as good, continues Bourdain.
  Positive
As the dual innovations of Tower and Waters are revealed, youll be wondering just why Alice Waters herself is not one of the interviewees  and youll find out.
  Negative
Youll learn more about what feeds Towers notions of the impeccable one of them being a preoccupation with the now almost entirely forgotten journalistdandy Lucius Beebe.
  Neutral
Youll find out what hes doing in Mexico at the films opening.
  Negative
The story of Stars, Towers own San Francisco restaurant, is similarly juicy.
  Positive
One interviewee compares it to the Velvet Underground in terms of its actual lifespan relative to its massive influence.
  Negative
And then, once we think were up to date with Tower, hes pulled out of his mysterious retirement in late   to take over the kitchen at a newly reopened Tavern on the Green.
  Negative
As Bourdain says, its a real WTF moment.
  Positive
Tavern, while a New York landmark, was never a bastion of fine dining, and given its capaciousness, it seems logistically unlikely that it could be.
  Negative
I got the impression that the film was expressly commissioned to chronicle Towers comeback in this peculiar setting, and for the final section of the movie, Tenaglia and her crew are the flies on the wall as Towers immovable standards collide with co-owner Jim Caiolas irresistible rights of proprietorship.
  Positive
New Yorkers know how it came out.
  Neutral
If you dont, the scenes of Tower walking around Central Park in the dead of winter as his observations concerning a horror of mediocrity and an abyss of slop may qualify as foreshadowing.
  Negative
It is in this section, too, that Tenaglia reveals certain stories about Stars and its demise that might be perceived as her burying a couple of ledes.
  Negative
By this time, though, one is invested enough in the story that the annoyance is minor.
  Negative
Had the picture been more coherently organized, its appeal might be broader.
  Negative
As it is, gourmands not foodies that word never comes up here, and if it did, I suspect Tower might rightly condemn it as the sort of vulgarity he complains of being surrounded by will avidly consume this very American story, the chaotic milieu of which is almost literally a world removed from the meditative one of a film like " Jiro Dreams of Sushi."
