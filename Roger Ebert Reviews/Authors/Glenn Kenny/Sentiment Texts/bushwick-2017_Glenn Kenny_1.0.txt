This movie will lose the goodwill of any longtime New Yorker watching it within the first ten minutes.
  Negative
Under the opening credits, there are a series of relatively pleasant helicopter views of Brooklyn, starting from the shores of Coney Island.
  Positive
But these grow more sinister as we note the presence of a machine-gun barrel in the bottom of the frame.
  Negative
Yikes.
  Neutral
Then: cut to an underground subway station.
  Neutral
Church Avenue, service by the G and F lines, as the visible signage shows.
  Negative
Lucy, played by  Brittany Snow, is wending her way to the exit, with her milquetoast boyfriend, played by Some Dude.
  Negative
Theyre mildly concerned because there doesnt seem to be anyone around but otherwise are feeling jokey about milquetoast boyfriends impending introduction to Lucys grandmother.
  Negative
Their reverie is interrupted by a screaming man, his body entirely on fire, running down from the subways street level stairs.
  Negative
Side note: I know that screaming-man-on-fire is a favorite shock effect of hack filmmakers the world over, but stop drop and roll is a real-life thing, unlike shooting zombies in the head is the only way to kill them, which is only a movie thing.
  Negative
Stop, drop and roll works.
  Positive
I once set my entire forearm on fire in a lighter fluid mishap, and I stopped, dropped and rolled instinctually, and it worked!
  Very positive
Why dont more movie characters try this?
  Negative
Now sensible people might react to this sight by going back down to the track level and getting the next train to somewhere else, but Lucy and milquetoast boyfriend have to check out the situation, because apparently Grandma is hung up on punctuality.
  Negative
No sooner does milquetoast boyfriend get to the sidewalk than he too is incinerated.
  Negative
Lucy, whose grandmother must be really very strict, goes to the sidewalk anyway, to see an overturned flaming Mr. Softee truck, and varied parties shooting and blowing stuff up.
  Negative
So she runs, and is pursued into a basement by two street menaces.
  Negative
One is white, or white-ish, while the other is black.
  Neutral
For balance.
  Neutral
Although the black one ends up being the more sexual-assault-menacing one.
  Neutral
Interrupting this unsavory bit of race-baiting is  Dave Bautista, an ex-Marine named Stupe, who owns the basement in which the rape is considered.
  Positive
He dispatches the villains briskly, but hes not particularly friendly to Lucy, at least not at first.
  Negative
As for the thing that will have New Yorkers checking out: When Lucy comes out of the subway station, she is indeed in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn' she runs past Jefferson Avenues fabled Owl Juice Pub and other landmarks.
  Negative
Only problem is that the Church Avenue station from which she supposedly emerges isnt anywhere near Bushwick.
  Negative
Lucy later tells Stupe that she came in on the L train' as seen on the signage at the beginning of the movie, the Church Street station services the G and F.   Whats the big deal?
  Negative
Ask  Martin Scorsese.
  Neutral
He has recounted in several interviews how nuts it used to drive him, in old Hollywood movies, to see a couple turn a corner in Greenwich Village and wind up strolling down the Brooklyn Heights Promenade.
  Negative
But theres a deeper problem at work.
  Negative
Nick Damici and  Graham Reznick, the screenwriters, seem to have based their portrayal of this transforming neighborhood in the county of Kings entirely on viewings of that old sensationalist TV cop drama Brooklyn South, which worried parents used to cite to their children when they wanted to dissuade them from moving to the borough.
  Negative
Additionally, they seem to have written their dialogue by typing out We gotta get the fk out of here!
  Negative
into their Final Draft document, copying that, and then pasting it onto each page, two or three times.
  Positive
For some reason they have crafted an inadvertently hilarious exchange between its two main characters: Where are you going?
  Positive
Hoboken.
  Neutral
Lucy is an entitled, petulant dolt whose most interesting trait is that she doesnt go into shock despite conditions that would put her there multiple times.
  Negative
Stupe is a stock Bautista type: taciturn, grunty, all that.
  Negative
Hes an ex-Marine whos supposed to have Rambo-esque skills and of course somebody makes a point of mentioning the Stallone character, for verisimilitude, I guess, but when he deigns to teach Lucy how to use a gun, he never shows her where the safety is.
  Negative
The movies main feature is a group of long-take, moving-camera action scenes that I guess might have been more engaging had the characters on the run and in battle been figures you wanted to spend any time with.
  Negative
Theyre not.
  Neutral
These set pieces are either getting much easier to do, or they are the sole talent of co-directors  Cary Murnion and  Jonathan Milott, because the filmmakers distinguish themselves in precisely zero other ways.
  Very negative
The obnoxious, opportunistic premise is a menace-from-within scenario thats laughable even in the wake of certain current events.
  Very negative
The numbskull faux nihilism of the ending is possibly intended as a homage to a recently departed horror movie director, but its more like a callow insult.
  Negative
