It simply wont do to call filmmaker  Frederick Wiseman a documentarian.
  Negative
Even film critics and film lovers who normally arent all that activelyavidly enthusiastic about the documentary feature as a form and I have to admit, Im one of them have to give it up for Wiseman.
  Positive
Like the Maysles brothers, like Shirley Clarke, like D.A. Pennebaker at his heights, Wiseman has created a body of work that proves him a great filmmaker, period.
  Positive
His latest picture, National Gallery, is a typically lucid, graceful and unobtrusively multi-tiered work.
  Very positive
The movie opens with a considered series of shots of paintings that hang in the London art museum that gives the film its title.
  Positive
While not a small museum, the National Gallery isnt on a scale like that of New Yorks Metropolitan or Pariss Louvre and hence its focus is a bit narrower' the place displays paintings dating from the  th  Century to the end of the  th .
  Negative
So immediately, as we perhaps recognize a Holbein or Rembrandt in the opening shots of the film, the movie draws us into an older world.
  Positive
But a familiar sound begins to break the silence that would create the ideal mood for contemplating these works?
  Negative
What is it?
  Neutral
It gets louder, and soon Wiseman cuts to a wider shot of one of the gallerys hanging rooms, and theres a fellow operating a floor polisher.
  Negative
This opening is a near-perfect encapsulation of Wisemans method.
  Neutral
His camerawork is as objective, or as objective, as it gets' hes really the only filmmaker of his gender who could set a documentary entirely in a strip club his   Crazy Horse without running the risk of indulging a male gaze.
  Negative
Where he editorializes, or makes a point of declining to editorialize, is in his cutting.
  Negative
The opening invites the viewer into the realm of the sublime, then drops the viewer into the realm of the quotidian.
  Negative
This juxtaposition, Wiseman suggests, is a part of what makes the Gallery a noble institution.
  Positive
Over the course of the movie, Wiseman takes us inside all of the activities that define this glorious space.
  Positive
There are shots of docents giving very lively and informed talks about art history and the different way art, particularly religious art, functioned in centuries past: The painting would be acting as a sacramental channel, explains one scholar.
  Positive
There is a meeting in which the head of the gallery, the lanky art historian Nicholas Penny, balks at the suggestion of using the faade of the gallery as a space for video projection of the London marathon.
  Negative
A colleague says that as the marathon will end in Trafalgar Square, theres an inevitability to the Gallerys presence in the coverage of the event.
  Negative
Penny, though thoughtful and understated, has clearly had it up to his neck with commercial considerations of a certain kind: Its gonna happen anyway so we should just use it then, is not, he states forcefully, an argument that cuts much ice with him.
  Neutral
Also depicted: Life drawing classes, repairing damaged art, budget meetings, concern over frame shadows in the display of a triptych, and more.
  Negative
About midway through the picture, we see some Greenpeace activists rappelling down from the roof of the gallery, hanging a large protest banner.
  Negative
More narratively-inclined documentary directors Im thinking of the Maysles would have spent some time focusing on the aftermath of the event.
  Negative
Wiseman shows it and moves on.
  Positive
Its just something that happened, something that happens, and speed bumps and such dont really figure that much in the day to day operation of such a place.
  Positive
The staff goes on, the lectures go on Penny himself gives an interesting talk of Caravaggios Boy Bitten By A Lizard and the incredibly absorbing three-hour film ends on a grace note that doesnt so much affirm the permanence of art as it celebrates the nobility of perpetuating and preserving art.
  Positive
