I went into The Babadook under a kind of misapprehension.
  Negative
Id heard a bit about the movie it would have been difficult, as a working film reviewer to not have but not orally, so I thought that the title was pronounced with a long o or even a sort of u, so it rhymed with Luke, or, more pertinently, an obscure Italian-American slang word that  Robert De Niro uses in  Raging Bull, that word being mamaluke.
  Very negative
As in, I look like a mamaluke.
  Negative
A WHAT?
  Neutral
Like a mamaluke.
  Neutral
Like the mamaluke of the year.
  Neutral
Under this misapprehension, I actually underestimated this horror movie, the debut feature written and directed by Australian filmmaker  Jennifer Kent.
  Negative
I was wrong.
  Negative
Both about the pronunciation of the title character its a short double-o, as in look or book and what it implied for the movie, which as it turned out, is, in my opinion, the finest and most genuinely provocative horror movie to emerge in this still very-new century.
  Positive
Both a relentless psychological thriller with heavy primal stuff on its mind and a full-throttle slam-bang scare-fest, it delivers raw sensation without insulting the intelligence the way the more sensationalist but also essentially trite pictures in the New Horror Paradigm along the lines of  Insidious tend to do.
  Positive
This is strictly my opinion, I am quick to point out.
  Negative
So impressed was I by The Babadook that upon seeing it I tweeted that I thought it might be the first capital-G Great horror movie of the  st  Century and was almost immediately beset upon by a couple of guys who thought I was out of my mind.
  Negative
The Babadook was both a snoozefest and ridiculous, and superior films included  Sinister and  The Conjuring.
  Positive
Now Im not sure that ridiculous is a word that ought to be applied to horror movies, especially if youre implying by comparison that stuff like Sinister and The Conjuring is NOT ridiculous.
  Negative
Its all ridiculous in a sense.
  Negative
What makes a difference is how purposeful the ridiculousness is made to seem.
  Negative
In The Babadook, a sense of urgency establishes itself immediately in a nightmare scene in which  Essie Davis Amelia is being rushed to the hospitaland this really is a nightmare scene.
  Negative
The urgency is over, the child she was being rushed to the hospital to deliver is now in early elementary school.
  Negative
And the father is dead, killed in an accident during that trip to the hospital.
  Negative
And the child, a little boy, is a pip.
  Negative
Samuel the cherub-faced  Noah Wiseman, giving one of the most amazing and intense child-actor performances Ive ever seen spends a lot of time playing games and concocting crude weapons with which to protect himself and his mum from imaginary enemies, and hes at work on this project day and night, loudly.
  Negative
When his vigilance isnt literally wreaking havoc on the small house within which he and Amelia live in near-isolation, Sam is a needy clinger who wont let his mum sleep.
  Negative
Hes a terror at school and he very nearly kills another child, the daughter of Amelias sister Claire, whose patience with the increasingly frazzled Amelia is wearing thin.
  Negative
The situations a nasty mess, and Kent really makes the viewer resent little Sam about it, particularly after little Sam discovers a rather malevolent childrens book that warns of the evil household influence of a nasty man called, yes, The Babadook.
  Very negative
Kents directorial strategy is a marvel.
  Positive
In the first half of the film, she tells the story through the increasingly bleary eyes of Amelia.
  Negative
Once the ostensibly nonexistent Babadook starts making himself known  most devastatingly in a car rearview mirror incident that provides one of the films most jarring and viscerally potent sequences it becomes Amelias turn to play the part of the monster.
  Negative
The heretofore intractable Sam begins to come off as vulnerable as, duh, he actually IS, while Amelias animus toward her son takes on what you might call supernatural proportions.
  Negative
The hiding-in-the-dark entity called The Babadook is the most slippery kind of menace in contemporary horror: a metaphor for both the terrors of childhood and the terrors of parenting particularly single parenting under a very vexed circumstance thats also, within the created world of the film, a very real thing.
  Positive
This movie has been compared to  Stanley Kubricks The Shining, which has very similar themes and also played similar games with deliberately blurring the lines between the contents of the troubled characters psyches and the possibly supernatural evils out to do them harm.
  Negative
In the end, The Babadook puts its chips on ending up as a more conventional horror movie whatever the Babadook is, its something, finally and thats all to the good as far as Im concerned.
  Negative
I like horror movies they made me like movies in the first place, in fact so seeing one as emotionally engaged, consistently gripping, beautifully constructed and paced, and really hella scary without mind-numbing sadism but WITH a fair amount of grisly imagery feels like a blessing.
  Negative
