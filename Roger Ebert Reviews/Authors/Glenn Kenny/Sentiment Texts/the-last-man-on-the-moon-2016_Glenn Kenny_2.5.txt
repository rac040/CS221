This is one of those impressionistic documentaries.
  Positive
It begins at a rodeo.
  Neutral
Youre supposed to think, Hey, why is this documentary about an astronaut opening at a rodeo?
  Neutral
The film keeps focus on a bronco rider preparing, and also on a distinguished looking older man whos watching the exhibition.
  Positive
The bucking bronco gallops out, rider hanging on for dear life, and the film cuts to the older man, whos concentrating hard on the bronc, and then it cuts to a shot of a zero-g simulator capsule and now the viewer is supposed to be like, A-ha!
  Very negative
That fellow watching the rodeo is the astronaut and the bucking bronco is making him remember that, and aw yeah, etcetera, etcetera.
  Negative
As you may have inferred this is not my favorite kind of documentary filmmaking.
  Negative
Eugene Gene Cernan, the subject of this film, whos also the older fellow watching the bucking bronco, is a man deserving of a tribute such as this movie aspires to give him.
  Negative
The filmmakers, attempting to jazz up their material, get in the way a lot.
  Negative
In a sense I understand why.
  Positive
NASA, and particularly the Apollo program, has been the subject of an awful lot of movies and television shows, some fictional, some documentary, some hybrid.
  Negative
If one is making a film about an Apollo astronaut at this late date, you might want to add more zip.
  Negative
Unfortunately director  Mark Craigs idea of adding zip is to roll out tropes and conventions that the real-men-in-space sub-genre has pretty much already beaten to death.
  Very negative
The  Forrest Gump-influenced song soundtrack, for instance, with doo-wop in the s and  Signs the original!
  Positive
playing over stock footage of, yup, carpet-bombing in Southeast Asia.
  Negative
The non-song soundtrack, meanwhile, by  Lorne Balfe, initially comes off like Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois music for Apollo reconfigured for a  Michael Bay picture.
  Negative
Cernans story is damned interesting, too.
  Positive
Born and raised on a farm that had no electricity, he grew up to be both an astronaut on Apollo , the advance mission that laid the groundwork for Apollo , and then on Apollo , the final manned moon mission.
  Negative
So his career encompasses pretty much the entirety of the moon program, on thats been treated in the likes of  The Right Stuff and From The Earth To The Moon.
  Positive
A lot of Cernans bearing and attitude squares with that of the stolid, stoic characters we met in those movies and shows.
  Negative
But when he waxes philosophical he shows a side I wish the movie had explored further.
  Negative
Describing his climb up the ladder back to the lunar module as he was getting ready to leave the moon, he says, I looked over my shoulder and theres the earth.
  Negative
Theres reality.
  Negative
Theres home.
  Neutral
The idea that his time on the moon constituted something that he considered not reality is fascinating, and I understand it.
  Positive
But I understand it to the extent that if I were in some sort of flying craft and I was made acutely aware that I was no longer ON EARTH, I would totally freak out.
  Negative
Whereas for Cernan, hes spent his whole life training for an eventuality that he would be spending some time headed toward and walking around on a body of land that was NOT EARTH.
  Negative
Thats totally messed up, right?
  Positive
Well, I think so.
  Negative
I wish this movie had gotten a little more into that.
  Negative
Rather than, you know, taken really beautiful NASA footage of capsules uncoupling in space and intercutting them with shots of Cernan sitting in his living room, on a lounger or some such thing, and were supposed to think hes closing his eyes and remembering.
  Negative
