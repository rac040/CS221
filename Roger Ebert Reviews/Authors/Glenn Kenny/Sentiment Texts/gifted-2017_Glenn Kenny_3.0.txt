This might sound like a typically cynical movie-reviewer thing to say, but the most surprising thing about Gifted is that its any good at all.
  Neutral
That is, if you are going by its premise alone.
  Neutral
The movie, from an original screenplay by  Tom Flynn a cursory glance at whose filmography does not inspire rock-solid confidence, is about a very cute young girl enrolling in first grade, much against her will, because as it happens shes an utter math whiz who prefers being home-schooled by her uncle Frank.
  Positive
Ensuing complications include a grandmother who feels the prodigy will be better off somewhere outside of Franks grungy Florida shack.
  Negative
The setup sounds like Rainman Annie or something.
  Neutral
But even the most high-concept movie is execution-dependent, and the execution here is far better than the premise leads one to expect.
  Positive
And as executed, the premise plays rather differently more of a  Kramer vs. Kramer meets  Little Man Tate vibe.
  Negative
In the middle of the proceedings, my jaw almost dropped: This is a child-custody  whats the word melodrama!!!
  Negative
And I dont say melodrama like its a bad thing.
  Negative
The world could use more of them these days as far as Im concerned.
  Neutral
If Gifted works for you as it did me, its mostly because of the cast, but also the way the story unpeels.
  Positive
Chris Evans is at his most effectively Evans-y in the role of Frank, who leads a mystifyingly quasi-carefree life repairing boats and looking after extremely adorable Mary  Mckenna Grace.
  Negative
On the opening day of school, he tells the little girl hes made her a special breakfast, and its soon revealed he means a bowl of Special K.
  Negative
The two have a good bantering style as he explains to her why its a good idea to break away from home-schooling and join grade one.
  Neutral
Youre gonna meet kids today you can borrow money from for the rest of your life, he tells her.
  Negative
As soon as Marys on the bus, Franks neighbor Roberta  Octavia Spencer, playing a role she must be pretty used to by now, but which she nevertheless does not phone in, and good for her, and the movie comes by to tell him that by insisting on sending her to public school, hes all but sealed Marys doom.
  Very negative
Why would that be?
  Neutral
The answer comes soon enough, as Mary amazes her kind but befuddled teacher Bonnie with her math-problem-solving stills.
  Negative
Marys gift, her boredom in class, and her passion for justice soon after day one, she clobbers a bully and more bring her to the attention of the school principal  Elizabeth Marvel.
  Positive
Said principal insists a public school is not the place for Mary, but Frank insists that it is.
  Neutral
One hates to side with the principal, but shes right.
  Negative
On the other hand, theres something about Frank that strongly suggests that as right as the principal is, hes more not wrong.
  Negative
The movie does not go out of its way to entirely vindicate Frank  not even when Marys grandmother comes swooping down from Boston.
  Negative
Played with poise and reserve by  Lindsay Duncan, shes an initially mysterious figure a woman of wealth from whom Frank has removed himself in so many ways that its hard to accept them as related at all, at least at first.
  Negative
While Flynns back-story scenario is probably likely to seem very silly if examined under a harsh plausibles microscope,  Mark Webbs smooth and assured direction, along with the performances of Evans and Duncan, make the unpacking of the relationship both narratively intriguing and emotionally credible, at least for the time that youre watching them.
  Positive
Which is largely what counts.
  Neutral
What follows is a custody battle where the adult players remain very civilized to each other throughout.
  Negative
Even though Mary herself is freaking at the possibility of being separated from Frank.
  Neutral
Their bond remains interesting and funny throughout, as their conversations exploit but dont oversell Marys precociousness.
  Positive
Is there a God?
  Neutral
she asks Frank during one of their conversations.
  Neutral
I dont know, he says, trying to be earnest and honest.
  Negative
Just tell me, she eyerolls.
  Negative
The movie consistently serves up funny morsels like this.
  Very positive
Also figuring in the eventually heart-tugging proceedings is a one-eyed cat named Fred.
  Neutral
And a potentially awkward, among other things, romance between Frank and Bonnie.
  Negative
Evans and Bonnies portrayer,  Jenny Slate, met while making this movie and dated in real life for some time after it wrapped.
  Negative
They have real chemistry on screen, and despite the online chatter rejoicing in the disparity of a superhero actor and an ostensibly down-and-dirty comedienne romancing in real life, they dont play here as any kind of odd couple, but rather as a solid and likable one.
  Positive
The movie overplays its hand at times, as when Frank brings Roberta and Mary to visit a hospital maternity ward for  well, a reason that doesnt quite make it.
  Negative
But Gifted is on balance a good-hearted entertainment that manages its plot curveballs, and everything else, with a show of compassion thats a kind of tonic for our Increasingly Strident Times.
  Positive
