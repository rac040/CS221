If youre like me, you laughed at the trailers for Baywatch, the feature-film comedy sendup ofhomage to the cheesy lifeguarding adventure TV series.
  Negative
That show featured quasi-hunk  David Hasselhoff and bodacious babe  Pamela Anderson plucking bodies from water and solving crimes, something that was not really their bailiwick a point that this movie at first pokes fun at, and then belabors into unfunniness.
  Negative
But let me not get ahead of myself.
  Negative
The trailers were funny enough to make me look forward to the picture.
  Positive
Imagine my displeasure when confronted with the nearly two-hour full feature, in which the trailer jokes were no longer funny' a full feature with a storyline that an enterprising six-year-old might have thought was a little too rudimentary.
  Negative
The fact that the storyline was concocted by  Thomas Lennon and David  Ben Garant, the hipster hacks who have in fact written a book about how to make big dollars in Hollywood by writing utter crap screenplays, could be said to add insult to injury were both injury and insult not totally predictable.
  Very negative
How is it, you might ask, that the trailer jokes are funnier than what is in the movie?
  Neutral
Well at least one joke from the trailer isnt in the movie.
  Negative
And as for the rest, the answer lies in the fact that this is another one of those raunchy comedies thats barely a movie, that looks like it was edited by dumping a bunch of footage into whatever movie-cutting software theyre using and hitting randomize.
  Negative
The number of out-of-continuity shots in the first  minutes was so large I stopped counting.
  Negative
The movie begins with  Dwayne Johnsons Mitch Buchannon, head lifeguard of Baywatch, running around his beach, reaffirming his supremacy.
  Negative
Tryouts for positions on his team are tomorrow, and today a few of the new recruits introduce themselves.
  Positive
One is Ronnie  Jon Bass, the tubby, nerdy tech guy with a thing for always-running-in-slo-mo Baywatch hottie CJ  Kelly Rohrbach.
  Negative
His thing is such that it causes him some physical discomfort in a long, drawn-out, unfunny stuck junk bit half adapted from Theres Something About Mary.
  Negative
Another candidate is  Alexandra Daddarios Summer, who will be the slo-mo brunette to CJs blonde.
  Negative
Ilfenesh Hadera is Stephanie, the most authoritative female of the crew.
  Negative
The guy who headquarters says must be included is disgraced Olympic swimmer Matt Brody  Zac Efron, whos getting on the crew in a combination of publicity stunt and community service.
  Negative
Mitch is not too happy about this.
  Negative
His name-calling of Matt which does include the sobriquet High School Musical is one of the few running bits that manage to raise a smile.
  Negative
After all the characters are introduced, we cut to the next days tryouts, at which Ronnie and Summer prove their mettle, and Matt goes head-to-head with Mitch.
  Negative
And after this scene, the movie injects an are you looking at my boobs exchange between Summer and Matt, in which the characters are wearing the costumes they had on in their introductory scenes taking place the day before.
  Negative
As they used to say on Mystery Science Theater , They just didnt care.
  Negative
Which may still have you asking, how does this affect the jokes?
  Negative
Well, in the trailer theres one isolated bit in which Efrons character stands gloating on a yacht deck, saying Jason Bourne aint got nothing on me.
  Negative
Only he doesnt get to the last word, because a bad guy behind him knocks him out.
  Negative
Funny in the trailer, because its cut to hit on a certain beat, and it does.
  Positive
In the movie, they use a completely different take of the line and the shot its a tighter perspective from a low angle, with a little anamorphic distortion and theres no breathing room before Efron makes his proclamation, so the line falls flat.
  Negative
It kind of goes that way throughout the movie.
  Positive
Which also features long periods of too-sincere homilies about teamwork, weirdly gratuitous brutality one innocuous character is subjected to a grotesquely grisly death and an extended corpse-penis joke which, in the dishonorable tradition of  Dirty Grandpa, subjects a character played by Zac Efron to humiliation in a way thats not even stealthily homophobic.
  Very negative
On the plus side, the movie has a pervading air of crass amiability about it its almost like a two-hour end-credits gag reel.
  Negative
Nevertheless, it contains an end credits gag reel.
  Negative
But as I said, if you saw the trailer, you got the best the movie has to offer.
  Positive
