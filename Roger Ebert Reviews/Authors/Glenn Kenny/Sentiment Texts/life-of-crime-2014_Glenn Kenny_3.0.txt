The late great  Elmore Leonard, on whose novel The Switch this movie is based, gets an executive producer credit on the movie.
  Positive
Its significant, perhaps, that said credit doesnt appear until after the movies played out.
  Positive
Shows a certain confidence on the part of the other filmmakers: they didnt feel the need to stack the deck with an emblem of Leonards approval at the films onset.
  Positive
It turns out, the confidence was warranted: Life of Crime is a pretty engaging, and pretty authentically Leonardesque, comedic crime movie.
  Positive
While it doesnt hit the highs of the very best movies based on the authors works those would be  Steven Soderberghs  Out of Sight and Quentin Tarantinos  Jackie Brown, two outstanding examples of American narrative cinema of the s its also far less slick and ingratiating than the watchable but very Hollywood-processed likes of  Get Shorty and  Be Cool.
  Positive
The assets of Life Of Crime include a relatively credible  Detroit setting, a generous array of seamy characters with seamy aspirations and interesting ways of talking, and a pretty first-rate cast playing those characters.
  Positive
John Hawkes and the performer usually known as Mos Def, here going by the name Yasiin Bey no, I dont know why are the criminals Louis and Ordell, and yes, these are the same characters who turn up in Rum Punch, which was the novel on which Jackie Brown is based.
  Very negative
For the purposes of this story, both of these bad guys are a little lessawful than they are in Tarantinos film.
  Negative
Point of fact, theyre kind of likable, especially Louis.
  Positive
Hes first seen being talked into a kidnapping scheme by Beys Ordell, who subsequently proves his get-the-criminal-job-done bonafides by facing down an obstreperous pimp.
  Negative
Ordells scheme is to kidnap the wife of a corrupt local businessman, and demand as ransom the money hes been secretly stashing down in a tax-shelter bank in the Bahamas.
  Negative
There are already a lot of holes in this scheme to begin with Leonards crooks are rarely the brightest bulbs on the Christmas tree but the biggest comes to light after the pair kidnap the disillusioned wife, Mickey, and stash her in the home of an accomplice whos a Nazi gun nut.
  Negative
That is, Mickeys husband, stiff-necked drunkard and all-around unpleasant fellow Frank, isnt all that interested in getting his wife back.
  Negative
And hes also got a little girlfriend at his Caribbean love nest, and she sees an opportunity in Mickeys misfortune.
  Negative
Before I got off on the plot synopsis I was praising the cast, and of course Hawkes and to a lesser degree the artist formerly known as Mos Def are reliable screen goods.
  Negative
As are  Tim Robbins as Frank a role that would have looked tailor-made for Christopher MacDonald  years ago, Isla Fisher as Franks, um, little chippie,  Mark Boone Junior as the Nazi gun nut, and  Will Forte as a social peer of the unhappy couple whos got a weird thing for Mickey.
  Negative
The big surprise here is Aniston, who gives one of her best if not best ever movie performances here.
  Positive
Although shes the female lead, she really lets herself melt into the ensemble, and I dont know if its the part or if shes really upped her acting game, but her performance is measured, engrossing, and empathy-generating without any overt striving, cutesy stuff, or sitcom-style tics.
  Positive
She actually develops quite a rapport with Hawkes, not a fellow you expect her to mix with either in character or not.
  Negative
The amusing twists and turns of the script, the multiple instances of bracing humor and consistent tension, help the cast bring this small-scale thriller to the place it clearly wants to be.
  Very positive
Well worth seeing, particularly for Leonard people.
  Positive
