This is a big month for bad wordplay in independent film titles.
  Negative
Theres a picture opening called Dark Night which was inspired by the  movie theater shooting in Aurora, Colorado, where another movie whose name youll never guess was screening.
  Negative
As for this item, directed by  Joel David Moore whos also a reasonably busy character actor, although he doesnt appear here from a script by first-time-feature-writer  Andrew Eisen, it is not a movie about young people in Oregon, as one might glean during the opening of the film, which designates  Frank Langella as the lead actor and shows him, shirtless, in front of a bathroom mirror, being not terribly youthful.
  Negative
No, the title is a play on the word euthanasia.
  Neutral
Langellas character, newly  years old, lives, imposingly, in the house owned by his adult daughter Kate  Christina Applegate and her husband Brian  Billy Crudup.
  Negative
Things are a little crowded in the house: Kate and Brian have two kids, hot-to-trot if youll excuse the expression cheerleader Annie  Nicola Peltz and rather more withdrawn Nick  Alex Shaffer, and Langellas Ray has a wife, Estelle  Mary Kay Place.
  Negative
The movie begins on a busy morning.
  Neutral
Brians asked to attend a clogged toilet, Annies taking under-the-shirt selfies to text to her football-player boyfriend, and the ceaselessly cranky Ray has a doctors appointment.
  Negative
At said appointment, Ray learns that the heart surgery he had a couple of years before hasnt entirely fixed his problems, and he confidentially tells his doctor he doesnt want any new surgery.
  Negative
That evening, at a party for his  th  birthday, upstaging an egregiously overacting waiter who goes on at length about a meal served with a creamy white sauce with herbs and spices seriously, the guy comes on like hes in a Monty Python sketch, Ray gets up and announces that he has decided to die, and that he wants to go to Oregon, where he owns a property and where the laws pertaining to checking out with extreme prejudice are somewhat agreeable, and get it over with.
  Negative
The thing is, he insists on going from the East Coast to Oregon by car, because he doesnt fly.
  Negative
I know, I too raised an eyebrow at a character who is hell bent on ending his own life but wont take an airplane to get to he place where hes going to do it.
  Negative
But this is the kind of movie Youth in Oregon is: a movie that has to have a Road Trip, because it will only be through a Road Trip that the characters can go through the kind of self-discovery that is the very raison detre of such entertainments.
  Negative
And so, with Brian offering to drive even though he thinks hes faking out Ray and Estelle the idea is hell talk some sense into his father-in-law and theyll all drive back home together the journey, accompanied by a solemn original music score fueled by minimal piano and mournful cello, begins.
  Negative
Ray insists on listening to birdcall CDs in the car.
  Negative
Stopping for lunch, he gets tetchy about not getting any mayo on sandwich, and when Brian wryly brings up Viagra for some reason, Ray gets to boasting about past sexual prowess, and loudly, so the feisty old guy acts embarrassingly in a restaurant requirement is checked off.
  Very negative
As Brians driving falters on account of being tired, Estelle, apparently a current or former nurse, offers him some uppers, and indulges a bit herself, so the comedic bonding via pharmaceuticals requirement is checked off.
  Negative
And so on.
  Neutral
At Salt Lake City,  Josh Lucas turns up as Rays estranged son, and the resentment between them is so thick that of course this character is the only one in whom Ray confides his condition.
  Negative
Back home, Annie keeps giving Kate trouble, and the movie gets padded in an unusual way, that is, with the suggestion of a sex scene between Annie and the aforementioned football player boyfriend  Will Janowitz.
  Negative
Theyre supposed to be on the outs because the aforementioned under-the-shirt selfies leaked to the high school populace in general, and when Kate walks in on the bubbling-up action, she is none too pleased.
  Very negative
Yeah, I dont know either.
  Negative
And on it goes, all coming together in the foreshadowed Oregon property which is well-kept in the way that such places are only in some movies and with one character pleading Please help me fix our family followed by a requisite reverse shot with a wide angle lens taking in a beautiful view of nature to contemplate as a human gesture of reconciliation is contemplated, then executed.
  Negative
Is this all well-acted?
  Positive
It certainly is, especially by Langella.
  Positive
But all things being equal, Id prefer to see him in a revival of The Man Who Came To Dinner.
  Negative
