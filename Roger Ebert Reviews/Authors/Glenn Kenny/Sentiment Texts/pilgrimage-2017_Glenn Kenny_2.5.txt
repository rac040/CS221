Pilgrimage is the kind of movie one fears is going out of style forever.
  Negative
A historical action drama, serious in tone and intent but also invested in delivering movie-movie thrills.
  Positive
You know, like  Richard Fleischers  The Vikings dont laugh although the cast led by  Kirk Douglas,  Tony Curtis and  Ernest Borgnine had some emotive tendencies, the movie overall is well-crafted and gutsy or, you know,  Braveheart.
  Negative
As one fears the fate of such a film, one has a tendency to overvalue, perhaps, a contemporary movie in this mode.
  Positive
As it happens, Pilgrimage has some of the good but not all.
  Negative
The movie opens on a moody, barren landscape, complete with threatening grey sky, in the year  A.D.
  Negative
A group of men have exposed a Christian, and are going to stone him to death, in spite of what I guess is the warning of thunder and lightning that occurs before the barrage is fully joined.
  Negative
Cut to , and a group of modest Irish monks are the guardians of a sacred relic that we will assume, correctly, is related to the previously partially shown event.
  Negative
We are now in the time of the Fourth Crusade, and a rider in a white robe comes along to say that the relic is requested by the Pope to use in Rome.
  Negative
Okay, the monks determine after vetting the white-robed rider Brother Geraldus, played by  Stanley Weber' theyll allow it.
  Neutral
A contingent of their own is sent along.
  Positive
Among them is a hulking mute, known as The Mute, played by  Jon Bernthal, whose agent here seems intent on making the actor over as Richard Kiel without the height.
  Negative
Theres also elder monk Ciaran  John Lynch and much younger monk Diarmuid, whos never been off the farm so to speak.
  Negative
Hes played by  Tom Holland, now famously Spider-Man in the DisneyMarvel movies.
  Positive
Holland shows promising range here' the characters undeniably young but hardly callow, and the movies narrative presents him with substantial moral challenges that the actor processes intelligently.
  Positive
Once the group sets off, fervently guarding the reliquary, Pilgrimage usefully makes the raw terrain the characters cross into an active antagonist.
  Negative
Soon some Norman troops are engaged, and a little after that a raw group of men attack the monks.
  Negative
The action is brutal but not too bloody.
  Negative
The Normans are keen to hold the sacred relic captive' they believe that by withholding it from the Pope, they can get the church to capitulate to their emperor.
  Negative
That something so awesome as this relic whose miraculous power and general import is revealed in a continuation of the  A.D. episode, recounted by one of the characters is being used as a political pawn makes an impression on Diarmuid, who begins to question his faith.
  Negative
Geraldus, on the other hand, seeing how deftly The Mute handles himself in a battle, proclaims that The Mute is himself an extension of the relics power.
  Positive
Does the brother believe this, or is he cynically egging on his companion monks?
  Negative
The movie never says so explicitly.
  Negative
But it also, I regret to report, does not make the questions themselves all that compelling in context.
  Negative
This despite being serious-minded enough to conduct the storyline in languages ostensibly accurate to the period and settings: Irish, French, and English.
  Negative
By keeping its focus on the men in the forests, Pilgrimage generates a largely admirable you are there sense of foreboding, but it also constricts the storytellers ability to engage the films larger themes in a way that give any real idea of whats at stake.
  Positive
Its interesting as far as it goes, but you wish it would have gone farther.
  Neutral
