In the bizarre, not to say entirely improbable, not to say pointlessly ridiculous, not to say well, you get the idea, world of Kill Me Three Times, ostensibly ordinary people in Western Australia have perfect teeth and perfect hair and generally very fit to middlingly fit bodies.
  Positive
And all these very well-maintained ordinary people seem to spend all their leisure time, of which theres apparently quite a lot, attempting varieties of criminal activity.
  Negative
Seems kind of counterproductive given the abundance of natural beauty in the location but what are you going to do?
  Neutral
Theres a barhotel owner sitting on a pile of apparently ill-gotten cash, a milquetoast dentist with a gambling problem and his hotsy-totsy wife whos got him embroiled in a murder-and-insurance fraud scheme, theres a wayward wife looking to rip off her suddenly cash-rich husband and leave town with the hunky local auto mechanic with a quick temper, and theres a crooked cop extorting money from a bunch of the aforementioned.
  Negative
And then theres the smart-ass know-it-all surveillance-specialist-cum-hitman who speaks the first word of the movie, which is, in case you couldnt guess, a four-letter one.
  Negative
The story mechanics of Kill Me Three Times, and mechanics really is the right word, are revealed, as the title suggests, in three discrete episodes, each one telling the same tale from a different perspective andor time frame.
  Positive
In the event this is starting to sound familiar, the films score, by  Johnny Klimek, is pretty heavily reliant on surf guitar, or at least a simulation of surf guitar.
  Positive
So, yes, improbably enough in the year of our Lord , Australian filmmaking once upon a time replete with original and powerful voices, mores the pity is offering up a slab of gigglingy sadistic sub-early-Tarantino hogwash.
  Negative
And populating it, dispiritingly enough, with relatively appealing acting talent:  Simon Pegg plays the hitman Wolfe, Alice Braga a wayward wife' the rest of the cast is actually Australian, and includes  Sullivan Stapleton of Animal Kingdom,  Teresa Palmer, here continuing a run of lousy casting luck that also includes  I Am Number Four and Warm Bodies, and stalwart  Bryan Brown, relaxed and smirky in the small role of the crooked cop.
  Positive
As it saunters to the not-inordinately tricksy steps laid out in  James McFarlands screenplay,  Kriv Stenders direction also luxuriates in competent cinematic sheen: helicopter shots over pristine blue water, approaching a beautiful glass and sandstone beach house' perfectly rectangular neon-colored lens flares in night-at-the-bar scenes' nicely framed shiny-brick-lined corridors awash in deep blue light.
  Positive
There are also some snazzy automobiles, including a mint condition fire-engine red VW bug.
  Positive
Because, you know, why not they like their unusual cars in their contemporary neo-noirs, dont they.
  Negative
The requisite spurting gunshot wounds to the neck are also here' what isnt here is engaging dialogue Tourist?
  Negative
the auto mechanic character asks Wolfe'  Sort of, Wolfe repliesor something like sort of, to be honest its hard to recall, and I didnt write it in my notes engaging characters, or any kind of convincing reason-for-being with respect to the whole enterprise.
  Very positive
One is apt to mourn the time wasted not just by the movies living participants, but also by the VW bug.
  Negative
All participants could have gotten up to something far more enjoyable.
  Positive
