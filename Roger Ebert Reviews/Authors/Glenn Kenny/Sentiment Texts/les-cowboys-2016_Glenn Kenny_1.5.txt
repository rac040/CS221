Some recent publicity for this movie, perhaps inspired by festival-circuit reviews, is pushing it as a variation of  John Fords  The Searchers transposed to contemporary France.
  Positive
I believe the invited comparison is pretty ill-advised.
  Negative
Les Cowboys, directed and co-written by  Thomas Bidegain, begins in the mid-s at a small food-and-music festival in France a so-called cowboy fair devoted to American country music.
  Negative
The spectacle of French folk sporting big metal belt buckles and cowboy hats, and trying to do justice to the likes of The Tennessee Waltz could be played for laughs, but Bidegain finds a quiet, earnest dignity in his subjects.
  Positive
The sequence is the best thing in the movie, in a walk.
  Very positive
Lead character Alain  Franois Damiens is about to lose his daughter, who runs off with her Muslim boyfriend that evening.
  Negative
And so Alain is set on an obsessive quest, one that will cost him much, including his marriage.
  Positive
His sense of mission is exacerbated by the events of , which happen more than half a decade after the daughter runs off.
  Negative
Eventually Alain enlists his son Georges  Finnegan Oldfield in his quest.
  Negative
One gets the sense that the younger fellow is more resigned to the loss of his sister, and goes along with his dad largely to keep him from going completely off the rails.
  Negative
At the midpoint of the film theres a major shift that puts Georges in the forefront of the narrative.
  Positive
He understands that his older sisters choices are her own, or at least he chooses to believe that they were.
  Positive
Nevertheless, hes resolved to at least lay eyes on her again.
  Negative
To that end, he, like his dad, compromises his personal relationships and opportunities, and journeys to Afghanistan, where he throws in with a shady American operator played by  John C. Reilly.
  Negative
The movie overplays its hand throughout, albeit in an unusual way.
  Positive
Its terribly scrupulous, careful, unostentatious.
  Negative
It proceeds with a hushed tone that wants to be taken for observant modesty, but eventually reveals itself as suffocating self-importance.
  Negative
The movie is pedantic, humorless, dry all of the things that, as it happens, The Searchers is not.
  Negative
There is a school of thought that believes The Searchers is a slog and a drag, but I invite you to watch or rewatch the film yourself some time to decide which of us is right.
  Negative
Director Bidegain, a longtime screenwriter, has his name on a bunch of good-to-near-great films  Jacques Audiards  A Prophet being among the good,  Bertrand Bonellos  Saint Laurent being among the near-great but his feature-helming debut sees him indulging in some tendencies a more proactive editor might have been able to talk him out of.
  Neutral
In particular, Bidegain likes to hold on a shot after a significant action has taken place for a couple of beats longer than might be considered customary, for no other reason than to nudge the viewer in the ribs and get him or her to nod in agreement, Yeah, thats right, Mr. Director, what youve shown me IS pretty heavy.
  Negative
Which aint how John Ford did it.
  Neutral
Even at his actual heaviest.
