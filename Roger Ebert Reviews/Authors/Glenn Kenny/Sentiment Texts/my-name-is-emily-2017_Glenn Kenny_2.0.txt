Watching a film, or I should say successfully watching a film, usually requires a willed suspension of disbelief.
  Negative
Id say the same thing goes for making a film.
  Neutral
In spite of technology that assists creative artists in getting more technically credible results with less work and for less money than in the past, making a film is still such an illogical process that successfully completing one requires a faith that passeth understanding.
  Negative
My Name Is Emily is in many respects an average and in several respects a kind of clichd and frayed coming-of-age movie.
  Negative
The protagonist, Emily, kicks off the film by speaking to the audience, relating her quirky childhood as the only child of an eccentric academic who becomes a best-selling author and a mother who dies too soon.
  Negative
She repeats apercus from her dad along the lines of If you hide from death, you hide from life and contributes cranky questions of her own to the narration like Why do we smile in photographs?
  Negative
The best thing about Emily is that shes played by  Evanna Lynch.
  Positive
Lynch, who played the charmingly abstracted Luna Lovegood in some of the Harry Potter pictures, has grown into a young woman who looks like a rougher-edged  Saoirse Ronan, and she brings a gritty conviction to the antisocial tendencies that Emily cultivates after her beloved dad, played by  Michael Smiley, is carted off to a lunatic asylum.
  Negative
Now with foster parents, she immediately alienates her new schoolteacher with a biographical approach to literary criticism, disclosing to her classmates that all that talk in Wordsworth about splendor in the grass is about sublimated sexual transgression and guilt.
  Negative
This and more put stars in the eyes of her handsome, upper-crust classmate Arden  George Webster.
  Neutral
Emily couldnt be less interested.
  Neutral
But then she does not receive her customary birthday card from dad, and Emily is forced to solicit her only potential friend on a mission to drive to the institution and confront the old man, and maybe even break him out of the joint.
  Negative
She calls on Arden at home just as hes getting a snootful from his awful dad, and before Arden can even say to dad Next time you hit me, you better knock me out, youre thinking  Road Trip!
  Negative
And off they go, abetted by a kindly grandma and her vintage auto and its attendant eight-track player, and John Dankworth tape, even.
  Negative
Their exchanges, given Emilys emotional blockage, are predictably prickly.
  Negative
You make me feel stupid, Arden helplessly protests to Emily at one point.
  Negative
Sorry   Emily responds, thats the nicest thing anyones said to me.
  Negative
I guess the point where I lost patience with the movie was when the duo finally made it to the asylum, and Arden decided to distract the inmates by doing an amateur pyrotechnics show on the roof of the drab facility.
  Very negative
Your mileage may vary.
  Neutral
What all this has to do with my ruminations at the beginning of the review is this: My Name Is Emily was made under more-arduous-than-usual filmmaking circumstances.
  Negative
Its writerdirector,  Simon Fitzmaurice, is afflicted with motor neuron disease, a condition similar to ALS, which is famously suffered by physicist  Stephen Hawking.
  Very negative
Mr. Fitzmaurice is confined to a wheelchair and can write and communicate with the assistance of a computer that he interacts with via the movement of his eyes.
  Negative
So, for him to have completed this feature, almost a decade after a diagnosis that at the time had him living for only another four years, makes My Name Is Emily a miracle in a way that most other movies arent, even if you allow that all successfully completed movies are some kinds of miracles.
  Negative
It also means that if youre a human being you have a rooting interest in Mr. Fitzmaurice.
  Positive
Whats the line between I wish I liked this movie better?
  Negative
and I wish this movie was better?
  Negative
Thats a knotty question.
  Neutral
I will say that one aspect of this film for which I have unqualified enthusiasm is the way Mr. Fitzmaurice and his cinematographer  Seamus Deasy shoot the various Irish locations, and how they place the characters therein' the effect is often beautifully picturesque without being in the least bit touristy.
  Positive
The sense of place is so palpable you can almost feel the raw wind going through the characters hair in the seaside-set scenes.
  Positive
It represents the movies most seductive achievement.
  Positive
