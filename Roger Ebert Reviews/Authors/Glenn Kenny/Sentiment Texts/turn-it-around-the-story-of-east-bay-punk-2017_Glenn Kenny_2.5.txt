In the last verse of the infectious Choc-Stock, a relatively early song by the mostly very excellent post-punk combo The Fall, the ever-dyspeptic frontman Mark E. Smith asks the listener, Why are you laughing?
  Negative
Why are you smiling?
  Negative
At or with this song?
  Neutral
Its not like YOUR SCENE or YOUR SCENE!
  Negative
The point being, well, I think you get it.
  Negative
The thing about scenes, and I believe this might be particularly true of scenes that coalesced around punk rock, is that members of them tend to want it both ways.
  Negative
They want to have their metaphorical secret handshakes all to themselves but they also want the world to understand just how cool their secret handshakes arewere.
  Positive
Another thing is that all scenes are the same, kind of.

A few years ago one of many punk-themed documentaries, this one focusing on a single venue in a once-industrial-leader town on the Eastern seaboard, came out, and a postpunk musician of my acquaintance was prominently featured therein.
  Positive
I was speaking to him about the movie and the venue it depicted, and he allowed, Yeah, that place was unique in that it was one of several dozen venues you could play at within a  mile radius.
  Negative
One of the points that writerdirector  Corbett Redford seems to dearly want to make in Turn It Around: The Story of East Bay Punk is that the scene his exhaustive-seeming, two-and-a-half-hour picture chronicles, was and is genuinely unique.
  Positive
In the end the movie makes its case but it takes a lot of familiar stuff to get there.
  Positive
Narrated by  Iggy Pop, the story begins in the late s, with Pop reminding us that San Francisco and the Bay area were the prime loci for the American counter culture.
  Negative
Archival footage of a less-than-amiable Governor  Ronald Reagan talking about some form of final confrontation with the dirty hippies underscores the point.
  Negative
But the movie is not about San Francisco, or San Francisco punk the title is precise.
  Negative
Yes, Jello Biafra of the Dead Kennedys is one of the pictures many onscreen talking heads, but his band is not featured.
  Negative
Rather, after establishing the roots that S.F. and its punk club Mabuhay Gardens established, the movie goes to Berkeley and Oakland and surrounding boondocks.
  Negative
This is one of those movies in which a lot of figures and bands that youve probably never heard of are referred to by a raft load of interviewees as legendary, or something like that.
  Negative
From Psychotic Pineapple to the Yeastie Girls, theres a lot of ostensible obscurity here.
  Negative
The movie also tells the story of the fanzine Maximum Rocknroll, which saw punk rock as a gateway form to other expressions of social activism.
  Negative
Back in the day, one rock critic, I think it was Lester Bangs, wrote that if the Sex Pistols were about tearing down the whole crummy establishment, the Clash were about what punk rock could put up in its place.
  Negative
Maximum Rocknroll founder Tim Yohannan eventually becomes a founder of a music space that also functioned and continues functioning as a community center,  Gilman Street, in Berkeley.
  Positive
Theres a lot of history to go over before the movie gets there.
  Negative
About an hour and a half in, Rancid founder Tim Armstrong talks about a local punk phenomenon called Hedgecore, wherein mosh pit habitus, when away from the mosh pit, threw themselves into suburban shrubbery with all their might.
  Negative
At this point my own patience was a bit tried, as it was when a latter-day Gilman Street manager recalls putting a no major label act prohibition on the space, and saying Id do it again in a heartbeat.
  Negative
The conditional irony here is that the movies executive producers are Billy Joe Armstrong, Mike Dirnt, and Tre Cool, aka Green Day, aka the single biggest band to emerge from this scene.
  Positive
You dont have to be a Green Day fan to find this movie interesting, but youll definitely be more inherently invested in it if you are.
