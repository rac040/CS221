A low-key and intelligent character study, Miss Stevens doesnt escape from its indie-film commonplaces often enough to become really distinctive, but it has enough conscientiousness about its people that it doesnt let the commonplaces fester into movie-sinking clichs.
  Positive
Directed by Julia Hart who scripted s woman-centered Civil-War-set drama The Keeping Room from a screenplay she co-wrote with  Jordan Horowitz, its an offhand tribute to teaching its titular protagonist, played by  Lily Rabe, is a high-school English teacher of obvious sensitivity, integrity and faith in her calling.
  Positive
Shes just having a tough time with, you know, life, and this picture works to capture that in a purposeful way.
  Positive
The movie begins with the slight, attractive Rabe seated in a theater, reluctant to leave after the lights have gone up.
  Negative
We find out whats there for her, or rather whats not there, later on.
  Negative
Hart leaps headlong into Miss Stevens' weekend mission: to drive three students to an off-campus drama competition, where the kids will deliver monologues and perhaps bring home prizes that will get their school some arts funding.
  Negative
The kids are: the smart and slightly stuck-up Margot  Lili Reinhart who on first impression seems to have a little Tracy Flick in her' the openly-gay but not overtly theatrical about it Sam Anthony Quintal and the troubled but also of course meteorically talented Billy  Timothe Chalamet.
  Neutral
The road trip gets off to a rocky start as Margot criticizes Miss Stevens taste in driving tunes, terming the stuff dad music.
  Negative
Billy digs it, and yes, this is one of those movies in which the characters bicker about a well-known pop tune and the filmmakers let you know where their loyalties lie by squelching the argument and letting the good part of said tune play out at full volume on the soundtrack.
  Neutral
I wont spoil the song for you but its not a favorite of mine.
  Negative
By showing his affinity for Miss Stevens early on, Billy, whos on meds and also is obliged to take a makeup exam some time over the weekend, first stakes his imaginary claim on her emotions.
  Negative
He figures they are two lonely people who can help each other, and Miss Stevens possibly unwise confession of a recent emotional episode eggs him on as does his unannounced decision to get off those aforementioned meds.
  Positive
Much is made in contemporary art assessment of a creators ostensible attitude toward his or her characters' speculation on this topic is often irrelevant andor stupid, but this movie makes it plain that it truly likes its characters.
  Neutral
One way it does so is in its disinclination to get them into scrapes of any sort that are too uncomfortable or grotesque this is arguably a more realistic approach as well, some might say.
  Negative
All of which is to say that while Miss Stevens Rachel to her non-students does make some bad decisions such as hooking up with a married male teacher played by  Rob Huebel, whose thirst for portraying schlubby cads seems unlikely to ever be slaked, she insists on treating Bill as her student, and working things out with him that way.
  Negative
The film moves from scene to scene with a fluid ease, and the acting is consistently winning and credible without ever being showy.
  Very positive
While the movies unprepossessing manner cant be said to backfire, exactly, its moments of wit and observation arent sufficiently startling to lift it out of engaging amiability.
  Positive
Recommended to teachers who want a this is what its all about smile or two.
  Neutral
