Its never a good sign, I reckon, when your movie shares a name with that of a British heavy metal band, especially when your movie is a sensitive indie character study.
  Positive
The discontents of "I Am I," the movie, have little to do with any nominal crossover or confusion, it turns out, but they are substantial nonetheless.
  Negative
Jocelyne Towne, making her directorial debut here, also wrote the script and plays the main character, Rachael.
  Negative
Rachaels got a complicated life: Mourning a mother who died unexpectedly, running a restaurant that was gifted to her by her generous older husband, and, at her moms burial, unexpectedly seeing, for the first time in a lifetime, the father that abandoned her and her mom when Rachael was a toddler.
  Positive
What was the kindly, white-bearded man, Gene  Kevin Tighe, doing there to begin with?
  Negative
Ah, therein lies a tale.
  Neutral
In the first scenes showing Gene and his dilemma the viewer might suspect dementia, but Genes condition is Korsakovs Syndrome, a not-quite selective amnesia.
  Negative
As it happens, Gene believes that hes still in his thirties, that the decade is still the s, and, so it would follow, he believes that Rachael, his daughter who happens to be the spitting image of her mother, is his wife.
  Negative
This state of events is definitely awkward and potentially mortifying, but Towne plays it straight down the middle, going for painful this-might-have-been emotion as well as the standard self-discovery stuff.
  Very negative
Shes a strong writer of individual scenes, and some of her dialogue is pretty sharp.
  Positive
"I never thought of myself as an event," Rachael says when a doctor tells her that Genes memory has completely wiped out particular events from before a given time.
  Negative
The writing does falter with some of the minor character bits, as in a feisty medical-facility receptionist who cracks wise on the vintage wear Rachael adopts on her visits to Gene.
  Negative
To get him to open up, and because he wont stop believing that Rachael is her mother, Rachael perpetuates Genes delusion.
  Negative
Again: potentially mortifying, but again, the story never really goes to the "there" that such actions suggest.
  Negative
Is this an evasion?
  Neutral
Perhaps, but the movie isnt involving enough to make one bother to call it out on such grounds.
  Negative
The cast, which also includes Townes husband  Simon Helberg, playing a more earthbound variant of the nice-guy misfit he does on the popular sitcom "The Big Bang Theory," does its job well.
  Neutral
The fault is in Townes direction.
  Negative
People sometimes complain that flashy, ostentatious visual stylization takes them out of the movie' what took me out of this movie was its flat, lifeless, unimaginative and conventional visual style, beginning with the near-boilerplate opening title montage concentrating on the lead characters feet as they go to the respective places to which they go.
  Negative
The drudgery of the shot-reverse-shot exchanges all in medium shot, the doll-house-like placement of the characters in long-take exchanges' Townes too-by-the-book approach makes the action seem stagey even when the actors are at their most "natural."
  Negative
This, I think, is what people mean when they talk about a "made for TV" look, but the fact is that nowadays even most TV is more engagingly lensed.
  Negative
If Towne had given herself one less job on this movie, she might have ended up with a more compelling result.
