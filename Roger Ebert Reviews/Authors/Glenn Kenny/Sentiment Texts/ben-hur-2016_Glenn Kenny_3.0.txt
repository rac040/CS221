If nothing else, Ben-Hur, directed by  Timur Bekmambetov from a script by  Keith R. Clarke and  John Ridley, is a masterpiece of condensation.
  Negative
The celebrated  version of the saga, once the most-Oscar-winning-picture-of-all-time, clocked in at almost four hours.
  Negative
The silent version was about two hours and twenty minutes, no marathon but still longer than average for its time.
  Negative
This movie, on the other hand, gets the job done in pretty much exactly two hours.
  Positive
The briskness was but one reason I found this quasi-Biblical epic strangely refreshing.
  Positive
This version of the strange novel concocted by Union Army General  Lew Wallace in  a warriors apologia for Christianity that surpassed s previous record holder Uncle Toms Cabin on the best-seller lists begins as Judah Ben-Hur a steely  Jack Huston and his onetime friend Messala  Toby Kebbell are facing off in a chariot race.
  Negative
Talk about beginning on a high note the chariot race of the William Wyler-directed  film, starring  Charlton Heston and  Stephen Boyd, is that movies climax.
  Negative
But fear not, the scene is just a preview, and we flashback, after a few expositional points in narration from  Morgan Freeman who, fear not, is also a character in the picture, to Judah Ben-Hurs noble household in Jerusalem eight years before, and see Judah and his Roman adopted brother Messala note the slight change in relations riding horses together carefree, until an accident places Judah in the care of his friend.
  Negative
Its a bit of a one-set-of-footsteps moment that has a big payoff later on.
  Positive
Wallaces novel was subtitled A Tale of the Christ and this movie was produced by Mark Burnett and  Roma Downey, whove parlayed Burnetts success with reality television into a shingle devoted to making movies with pronounced Christian content.
  Negative
Hence, this Ben-Hur has more Christ in it than any previous version.
  Negative
And a lot of philosophizing in the dialogue.
  Positive
You confuse peace with freedom, one character opines at a certain point' at another the ideal of a civilized world' progress, prosperity, and stability is proffered, which sounds like a setup for a takedown of secular humanism.
  Negative
When first seen, Jesus  Rodrigo Santoro is carving wood, and overhearing a conversation between Judah and his later-to-be-converted wife Esther  Nazanin Boniadi, he gently pipes up, Love your enemies.
  Positive
Love your enemies?
  Neutral
Thats very progressive, Judah responds.
  Negative
Soon, when hes stripped of his home and family and enslaved on a galley ship, he will have the opportunity to turn those words over.
  Negative
The characters all speak in a completely contemporary tone, which shows the influence of what do you know?
  Positive
Scorseses  The Last Temptation of Christ, which was criticized for among other things having the Apostles talk like theyd just hopped off the IRT.
  Negative
This is not particularly bothersome, it turns out.
  Negative
In the net plus department, once the action really gets going, its quite good.
  Positive
The sea battle during which Judah makes his escape is a really effective bit of action moviemaking one of those scenes that compels you to exhale when its finally over.
  Positive
Its frantic and loud, but not particularly over-the-top, which is unusual for Bekmambetov.
  Negative
Also unusual is the relatively restrained violence theres a lot of brutal behavior in the picture but its depiction is relatively restrained, another first for its director, whose work in the likes of  Night Watch, Day Watch, and the abysmal  Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter lacked a lot of worthwhile qualities, nuance being one of the bigger ones.
  Neutral
I have to credit Burnett and Downey here' clearly they had a commitment to keeping the film as family-friendly as possible.
  Positive
The chariot race, too, is both wholly watchable no bones are crunched, and plenty could have been and coherent.
  Negative
Lead actors Huston and Kebbell both do very credible work, although in Judah Ben-Hurs earliest incarnation Huston does look a bit like  Jimmy Fallon doing Barry Gibb.
  Positive
And at certain of their bro-out moments Huston and Kebbell look like theyd just as likely walk off the set and go check out Sleaford Mods.
  Negative
Does the movie radically re-arrange both its source material and that materials most famous adaptation?
  Negative
It sure as hell does.
  Negative
But I doubt that many contemporary viewers consider either of those as holy writ.
  Negative
This is a Ben-Hur of and for its time, but also a little better than its time, it turns out.
  Negative
Im not qualified to say whether its an effective delivery system for its Christian message, but I think I can credibly pronounce it a good popcorn movie.
  Positive
