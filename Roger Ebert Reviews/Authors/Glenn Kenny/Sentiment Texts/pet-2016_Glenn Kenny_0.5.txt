  Negative

  Positive
Never go full Anthony Perkins, Seth.
  Negative
I should clarify that he goes full Anthony Perkins in the sense of Norman Bates making a sandwich for Marion, not doing the other thing.
  Negative
Still.
  Neutral
Dont do that.
  Neutral
This is one of those movies in which the main character is a perfectly round-edged sad sack who,after the precipitating incident of running into a high school crush,suddenly acquires an expertise in stalking.
  Negative
Soon Seth is Googling like mad the website he uses is a fake one called Sleuth, and good on Google for making their name hard to use in trashy movies like this one, visiting Hollys place of work, and asking a surly and burly coworker, Nate  Da'Vone McDonald, how to talk to girls.
  Negative
During his incredibly inappropriate pursuit of Holly, during which he fritters away most of the sympathy a viewer might be able to muster for him, Seth makes a particularly bad move and ends up taking a punch to the face, which he laughs at, because chasing Holly has unhinged him just that badly.
  Very negative

  Positive
Including the actual nature of the relationship between Holly and her sassy-n-tatted roomie Claire  Jennette McCurdy.
  Neutral
The rank, idiotic implausibilities continue to mount, including Seths transformation from a wholly recessive personality into a kind of master of psychological manipulations.
  Negative
The movie is also replete with nasty shock effects captivity really does a number on Hollys manicure, for one thing and stupendously banal dialogue: Look, Im not some psycho, okay?'
  Negative
You just have it all figured out, dont you?'
  Negative
and of course the inevitable You dont get it, do you?
  Negative
The movie, directed with unbecoming relish by  Carles Torrens from a script by  Jeremy Slater who wrote the disastrous  Fantastic Four, which maybe made him bitter sputters and pants its way to a kind of twist, one thats genuinely misogynist on the one hand but also too cretinous to be authentically repellent.
  Negative
In a movie year in which Ive had to see both  Clown and  Trash Fire, the bar for worst of year is pretty low.
  Negative
I suppose that Pet, for me at least, completes a trifecta of sorts.
