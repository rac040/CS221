Im giving this movie half a star more than I really want to because Im aware that there are many contemporary moviegoers who are wired differently than I am.

Man From Reno reviewers are going to almost reflexively want to call it The Man From Reno, but once theyve actually got the movie in mind theyll be reminded theres a good reason thats not the title is an intricately, even densely, plotted mysterythriller that casts an unusual spell from its opening scene.
  Negative
Pepe Serna plays Paul Del Moral, a sheriff in a small town south of San Francisco.
  Negative
Out on a casual patrol one fog-shrouded evening, he finds an abandoned car, reports on it, drives on, and is stunned when a man bounces off his windshield.
  Negative
He brings the fellow to a hospital.
  Positive
The victim, a Japanese fellow in his s, is out cold.
  Negative
The movie cuts to a press conference in Japan.
  Neutral
Young author Aki Akahori  Ayako Fujitani is being feted on the occasion of her latest novel, which she tells her publicist will be the last featuring her popular creation, the seemingly Columbo-esque avuncular detective Inspector Takabe.
  Negative
Freaked out by too much attention, and possibly something else, Aki hightails it toSan Francisco.
  Negative
Without telling anyone.
  Neutral
An impromptu meeting with some old friends gives her a chance to show off some chops-in-deduction, traits the viewer is meant to believe she imbues her fictional creation with.
  Negative
But Akis not as cocky as all that.
  Neutral
Toying with a straight razor in her hotel room bathtub, shes clearly in distress.
  Negative
Maybe the charming stranger who approaches her in the hotel bar, also Japanese, can provide some distraction if not salvation.
  Neutral
For a while the two narratives, that of Sheriff Del Moral and Aki, run on alternating parallel tracks.
  Negative
Co-writerdirector  Dave Boyle actually keeps the viewer guessing with respect to timelines' as various unseen Asian men keep turning up in different states of distressed being, and Aki meets various other harried Japanese males, one is apt to wonder if the movies playing some sort of staggered-time game.
  Positive
As it happens, its not.
  Neutral
Once Del Moral and Aki find each other the plot both deepens and thickens.
  Negative
Serna, with a good-humored gravitas that brings to mind  Jason Robards, Jr., and Fujitani, whose combination of vulnerability and sharpness is spectacularly appealing, make a really intriguing team of investigators.
  Very positive
And thats part of the problem with the film, at least for me.
  Negative
And here I must pause, and ponder the ethics of the spoiler alert.
  Negative
This should serve as a signal for any reader with a powerful interest in watching the movie to stop reading now.
  Positive
Still reading?
  Neutral
Okay.
  Neutral
Well, Im not going to give anything away, at least not directly.
  Negative
Instead, I shall comment on the general topic of Genre Convention and what I consider acceptable ways of Breaking Genre Convention.
  Negative
Any of you folks out there remember a  Korean movie called The Chaser?
  Neutral
Really brutal, engrossing, race-against-time thriller that broke genre convention in a lot of ways, not least of which was making its titular protagonist the most unappealing character you could ever not-want-to-but-nonetheless-be-compelled-to-root-for in a movie ever.
  Negative
Which was kind of exhilarating.
  Positive
But thenWell, sometimes a movie oversteps its boundaries in an attempt to be different, and sometimes that overstepping is a grave miscalculation.
  Negative
The last section of Man From Reno takes the movie into territory explored by the original The Vanishing and, of course, David Finchers  Zodiac.
  Neutral
Legitimate avenues, arguably, but I have to admit, as a viewer who was engrossed and invested in the characters, said exploration ended up really pissing me off.
  Negative
But what if Im wrong to be pissed off?
  Negative
Hence, my three-star rating of the movie as opposed to the two-and-a-half Id LIKE to give it.
  Negative
Id really love OK, maybe love isnt the right word to discuss this issue with viewers once theyve had a chance to see Man From Reno.
  Positive
Genre fans ought to check it out post haste.
  Neutral
Im one myself, and my admiration for the superb conception and execution of the film goes hand in hand with disappointment and irritation.
  Negative
My question for myself is, do I have a critical leg to stand on, or am I taking the movie too personally?
  Negative
I have to give it credit for even making the question come up in the first place.
  Positive
