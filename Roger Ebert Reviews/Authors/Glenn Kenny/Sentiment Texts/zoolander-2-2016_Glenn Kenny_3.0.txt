Does America really NEED a sequel to the  Ben-Stiller-starring-and-directed send-up of the fashion and supermodeling worlds, and the apparently ceaseless vacuity thereof and therein?
  Negative
For the first  minutes or so of Zoolander , the answer is a pretty flat no.
  Negative
The sequel, again directed by and starring Stiller in the title role of Derek Zoolander, whose skull is so thoroughly empty that to call him an airhead would be an insult to air, along with  Owen Wilson as counterpart dimbulb male model Hansel, and many others from the original cast, begins with a gag thats already been overplayed in the trailers.
  Very negative
That is, the assassination of pop star  Justin Bieber, who, before he saunters off this mortal coil, takes a selfie while making a signature Derek Zoolander look.
  Negative
What follows is a multi-media-personality whatever happened to?
  Neutral
sequence.
  Neutral
Every TV news personality of note save for maybe Brian Williams adds a sound bite to the story, which features an arguably tasteless fictional disaster befalling a construction in downtown Manhattan close to the Hudson River.
  Negative
Soon, the audience sees a mountain lair in a snowy, windy surrounding, and the title in the lower right hand corner of the screen reads Extreme Northern New Jersey.
  Negative
Im a sucker for a good Jersey joke but I still wasnt hooked.
  Negative
Eventually I was, though.
  Negative
Zoolander  is not just relentless in its joking, it becomes relentlessly clever in debunking itself as it goes along.
  Negative
This is barely a movie, I thought, as it hopped from one inane plot device to s music cue to s music video pastiche to inane plot point.
  Very negative
But the observations about the fashion world got, if not sharper I dont know enough about the contemporary fashion world to vouch for accuracy, then definitely more pointed, beginning with Kyle Mooneys portrayal of a hot new designer named Don Atari whose aesthetic pinions on how much everything sucks and is stupid.
  Negative
Derek and Hansel have been persuaded via old friend  Billy Zane to participate in Ataris fashion show in Rome, lorded over by a spectacularly pompous couture doyen named Alexanya Atoz, played by a nearly unrecognizable Kristen Wiig.
  Negative
Atozs schtick is elaborately mispronouncing English words, and this is hammered almost as insistently as is Dereks idiocy.
  Very negative
The biggest comic risk the movie ends up taking, as it happens, is in scenes in which Derek doesnt get something.
  Negative
And this is entirely the case lot once  Penelope Cruz, playing a member of Interpol, Fashion Crime Division, invests him and Hansel in a world-saving or something mission.
  Negative
The character is literally so dumb that its not funny, except it becomes funny by dint of the way its not funny, and so on.
  Very negative
And honestly, it then becomes very funny, funny enough that my wife observed that she thought I was going to have a stroke, as I was laughing so much.
  Positive
I was also laughing hard enough that I stopped taking notes.
  Negative
So what more can I tell you about this movie?
  Neutral
Well, there are enough cameos in the damn thing that you might eventually wonder why you yourself are not in it.
  Negative
The bit in which  Benedict Cumberbatch appears as an apparently pan-gender supermodel named All does play fast and loose with the skirting-ideological-objectionability thing, but on the other hand, every character and personage depicted in this movie is utterly, one might even say abjectly, ridiculous, so for All to be depicted as not ridiculous might have constituted a progressively active judgment, but also would have been on the inconsistent side.
  Very negative
Also, this is a movie that makes an elaborate joke about the prospect of a -year-old boy getting his heart carved out of his chest, and the real-life denizens of the real-life fashion world attaining eternal youth by drinking his blood.
  Negative
Yes, you read that correctly.
  Positive
This is where Will Ferrells fashion villain Mugatu comes in, along with more cameos, and Cyrus Arnold, a very nervy tween, in the role of Dereks wayward, and purposefully chubby, son.
  Very positive
As the action gets more furious, and Owen Wilson in particular is given more and more of an opportunity to unspool his seemingly inexhaustible comic genius, it might be easy to miss the fact that Zoolander  bites a certain hand with more perspicacity than that displayed in Stillers  I-hate-Hollywood effort  Tropic Thunder.
  Negative
It takes a certain something to convince the likes of Tommy Hilfiger and Alexander Wang to show up and play themselves, and depict those selves as eager to participate in ritual murder and cannibalism.
  Positive
Sounds pretty heavy-handed as satire goes, but the thing is, Zoolander  has indulged in so many inversions of its narrative by this time that the insult to fashionistas comes off as both entirely sincere and futilely insubstantial.
  Negative
But this is all better gist for some future Ivy League film studies class than this review.
  Negative
I laughed so much my wife thought I was going to have a stroke.
  Positive
Theres the blurb for you, Paramount.
  Negative
Thanks, Derek!
