The period spy thriller The Man From U.N.C.L.E. is only intermittently engaging and amusing, and those portions of the movie that succeed are also frustrating.
  Positive
Because theyre cushioned by enervated, conceptually befuddled, and sometimes outright indifferent stuff.
  Negative
Adapted from the genuine-article s television series, which paired steely, no-nonsense, mid-Atlantic-accented veteran spy Napoleon Solo with younger slightly petulant Russian moptop Ilya Kuryakin, co-writerdirector  Guy Ritchies film situates itself in an early Cold War wherein J.F.K. is still giving inspiring speeches.
  Negative
This movies Solo Henry Cavill struts his bespoke-suited self right into East Berlin to spirit out feisty femme auto mechanic Gaby  Alicia Vikander, whose dad is an A-bomb expert now working, apparently against his will with some neo-fascist Italian shipping magnates out to spread nuke terror.
  Negative
Solos here working for the C.I.A.' hot on his trail is strong-jawed, Terminator-strong Kuryakin Armie Hammer.
  Negative
A chase ensues with all three parties ducking each other and Kuryakin actually ripping the trunk door off of one of the cars involved.
  Negative
Solo and Gaby cross the Berlin Wall by means of a sort of zipline' imagine Solos surprise when he soon learns that for his next mission he has to collaborate with the KGB agent who almost had him for dinner.
  Negative
A gruff Agency honcho  Jared Harris, approximating a Texan accent, delivers the news and he and his KGB counterpart debrief the unhappy new partners at a crowded outdoor caf.
  Negative
Why these guys are spilling international secrets in a setting where they can be effortlessly overheard is the source for one of the movies better visual gags.
  Negative
Alas, the movie doesnt have too many more gotcha!s in its bag.
  Negative
The two spies soon touch down in Italy, where they flirt Ilya with Gaby, and Solo with one of the neo-fascists, a blah femme fatale played by  Elizabeth Debicki and do spy stuff.
  Negative
In this movies reimagining of the characters, Solo has a backstory as a master thief, while Ilya is a chess-obsessed strong man with rage and daddy issues.
  Positive
This gives Cavill and Hammer amusing bits to enact, but, and heres a big rub, whatever it is that Cavill and Hammer are supposed to bring to this movie, they dont.
  Negative
They fill out their clothes very nicely, its true, but other than that they are to charisma what black holes are to matter.
  Negative
Flat really doesnt begin to cover it.
  Negative
Then theres the direction.
  Neutral
Ritchie clearly wants to revel in a pre-swinging-s vibe, but he either cant or wont commit to it in a way that yields any actual fun.
  Positive
Possibly hes wary of bumping up against Austin Powers-style pastiche, but whatever the cause, when hes not being incoherent, hes being fussy.
  Negative
Even the soundtrack has a kind of stick up its fundament' its chock full of the Right Names in early s international and largely Italian pop, but its largely lacking in infectiousness.
  Negative
Seriously, they could have thrown in a Take It East My Brother Charlie or something and only a jerk like me would have pointed out the anachronism.
  Negative
There are times when the movie uses its leads lack of affect in service of a cheeky sense of humor, as in Solos sojourn in the cab of a truck, after a frantic chase scene, sitting out or so it seems a near-fatal brush with danger for partner Ilya.
  Negative
But much of the time Richie seems uninterested in the action, although a final chase featuring a jeep, a skeletal ATV, and a motorcycle unspools like a choose-your-own-adventure video game, and I mean that in a good way.
  Negative
But the misfires are just as memorable, as when Richie and company use realistic evocations of Nazi atrocities to fill out the character of one minor villain.
  Negative
And if you were lucky enough to have seen Vikander in  Ex Machina and if you havent been you ought to change that, youll be profoundly appreciative of just how much shes wasted here.
  Negative
Shes adorable anyway, however.
  Negative
While it cant be said that  Hugh Grant saves the movie, his return to prominence in the last half hour, after a plot-seeding-walk-on earlier in the movie, peps things up considerably.
  Negative
Grants character is the one that pulls the whole U.N.C.L.E. concept together, birthing an agency in which KGB, C.I.A., and MI or  or whatever it is can cooperate to prevent mutual assured destruction or something like that.
  Negative
Kind of like that agency in that other summer spy thriller that this summer spy thriller is not going to present any serious competition to.
  Negative
In any event, an entire movie in which the weathered but still debonair Grant played the bluff, amiable puppetmaster to the two hunky ciphers might have been great fun.
  Negative
I gather that Richie and company still want to make that movie.
  Negative
I have mixed feelings about whether they ought to, or will.
  Neutral
