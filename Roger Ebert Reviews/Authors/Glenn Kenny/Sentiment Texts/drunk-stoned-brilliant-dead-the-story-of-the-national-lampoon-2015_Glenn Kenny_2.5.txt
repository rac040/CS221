If youre a scholar of comedy, Drunk Stoned Brilliant Dead: The Story of the National Lampoon, a concise doc about the founding, life, thriving, and death of the 's-defining satirical magazine, is likely a must-see.
  Negative
Its an engaging and entertaining film, filled with funny anecdotes expertly related.
  Very positive
It contains some notable get interviews.
  Positive
The magazines reticent co-founder, Henry Beard, the buttoned-down superego to his Wildman cohort Doug Kenney, appears on camera throughout, which was a surprise to me: Beard, while still an active writer and editor, has kept a downright reclusive public profile in the years since the magazine folded.
  Negative
Of course, if you are a scholar of comedy, you probably already own the coffee table book, edited by former Lampoon contributor Rick Meyerowitz, also called Drunk Stoned Brilliant Dead, which tells the story of the magazine and some of its most notorious staffers.
  Negative
That book also features generous samplings of the magazines work, which the movie, directed by Douglas Tirola, can only offer piecemeal, or mutated via animation, a very popular tactic in documentaries nowadays.
  Positive
What the movie offers that the book cant are exciting clips from the Lampoons stage show, which featured performances by future screen comedy icons such as  Chevy Chase,  John Belushi, Christopher Guest, Gilda Radner, and many more.
  Negative
The movie does an excellent job of chronicling how those stage shows gave rise to Saturday Night Live, which created a huge talent drain at the magazine, and how the film National Lampoons Animal House, while a huge unexpected monster hit that vindicated the insight of the magazine staffers who conceived it, also diffused the energies of some of the magazines visionaries.
  Very positive
These chronicles are interspersed with a lot of things you see too much of these days in docs about cultural phenomenons: interviews with celebrities who tell you why the cultural phenom under examination here was really important and stuff, animated recreations of particularly outrageous anecdotes, and poignancy.
  Negative
The story of Kenney, who died in a hiking accident in Hawaii in , is played out like something out of a Fitzgerald tale with longer hair, while the passing of anger-management failure Michael ODonoghue elicits a bit less in terms of warm sentiment.
  Very negative
As watchable as the movie is, its an almost relentlessly incurious history.
  Negative
The founders of the magazine, and its admirers, go on at some length about what outsiders Beard and Kenney were as they tried to pitch their spinoff of the Harvard Lampoon to Madison Avenue in the late s. Yes, you read that right: the Harvard Lampoon.
  Positive
No one can be bothered to point out that an outsider coming from Harvard is still, um, coming from Harvard.
  Negative
The doc is similarly unconcerned with the fact that the magazine was by and large not just a boys club but also a white boys club.
  Negative
Its not as if the Lampoon didnt butt heads with feminist forces during its actual existence, and the canard about women not being funny is far from dead.
  Negative
So it would have been nice to hear from, say, writer Anne Beatts about this, as entertaining as her anecdote  about getting into the mag by dint of having been a male staffers girlfriend.
  Negative
And while a few black performers are seen in stills from the Lampoons stage show, the overall aesthetic that comes across in the movie is so almost relentlessly white that one almost has to ask: could Beard, P.J. ORourke,  Sean Kelly, or any of these guys, even ever conceive of having an African-American writer in on an edit meeting?
  Negative
Except nobody making this movie did.
  Neutral
Which, admittedly, doesnt amount to anything like a massive social injustice, unless, maybe you stop for a minute and look hard at what the magazine was satirizing.
  Negative
