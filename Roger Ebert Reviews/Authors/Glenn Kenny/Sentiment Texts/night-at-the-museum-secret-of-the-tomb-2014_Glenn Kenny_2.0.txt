When the two writers of the first Night At The Museum picture,  Thomas Lennon and Robert  Ben Garant, wrote a jokey but highly pragmatic book entitled Writing Movies For Fun And Profit, franchise star Ben Stiller blurbed it thus: These two guys are the reason Night At The Museum won so many Oscars.
  Negative
Behind the good-natured jokey cynicism theres a truth: as talent-packed as any Night At The Museum picture may be in this third installment  Rebel Wilson,  Dan Stevens and Sir  Ben Kingsley join cast regulars Stiller, the late  Robin Williams, Steve Coogan,  Owen Wilson,  Mizuo Peck and others one doesnt come to a movie of this sort expecting anybodys best work.
  Negative
Or at least one certainly shouldnt, because it wont materialize.
  Neutral
What Night At The Museum: Secret Of The Tomb does offer is a tired faux-Indiana Jones style prologue giving a little back story on the ancient Egyptian tablet which looks like a giant gold ATM pad with the magic to bring all the historical exhibits to life after the sun goes down.
  Negative
Looks like the tablet has got a case of ancient-curse rot, and its causing the exhibits to intermittently run rampant, causing  Ricky Gervais museum director to lose his job and Stillers guard-turned-keeper-of-the-museums-secrets to head across the pond, where a personage housed in the British Museum may be able to reverse the rot.
  Negative
And so the familiar folk from the first two films, including an incontinent Capuchin monkey, a mugging Attila The Hun, Coogan and Wilsons tag-team pompous Roman and aw-shucks cowhand, both in miniature, and more, get to rub elbows with a Sir Lancelot whos plenty confused upon reanimation and an Egyptian semi-deity played by Kingsley.
  Very negative
While Stiller has to distract his British counterpart, a chatty night guard played by the voluble Wilson.
  Negative
The movies scenario and incidental bits are largely as stale as any studio product gets' to go by this movie, theres no higher form of humor than the juxtaposition of old people doing newmodern things.
  Negative
So, despite the fact that  Andrea Martin is by herself one of the funnier performers alive, Secret introduces her librarian character by showing her playing Candy Crush.
  Neutral
Ten minutes cant go by in this movie without it showing Neanderthals dancing to Shake Your Groove Thing or To Be Real or Best Of My Love or I cant tell you what.
  Negative
The CGI Capuchin monkey peeing is also ostensibly hilarious.
  Positive
I know this is largely a kids movie but, I cant say I was super-engaged.
  Negative
Every now and then a cast member will cook up a moderately engaging bit of business one of the Neanderthals, for instance, is a Stiller doppelganger, also played by Stiller, and their interactions sometimes call to mind the dynamic of the mirror scene in the Marx Brothers  Duck Soup  and coax a laugh or two, but then the movie shifts back into its formula and becomes a drag again.
  Negative
Things pick up a bit in the last third, in which Lancelots confusion over  Camelot yields a funny pair of celeb cameos, only to revert to form with a what-will-happen-at-the-last-minute-to-save-the-day finale and treacly coda.
  Negative
They cometo learn, Williams Teddy Roosevelt mutters rather half-heartedly near the end of this picture, reflecting on the function that museums can, or ought to, play in the lives of children.
  Negative
He also mentions sparking the imagination, all that sort of thing, and at this point, having endured, among other things, an action scene inside an M.C. Escher drawing that should have been a lot more creative fun than it turned out, the adult viewer, reflecting on the idea that this is just a kids movie, might conclude that kids deserve a little better.
  Positive
As did Williams and  Mickey Rooney, both of whom will have this expensive but ultimately indifferent item at the tail ends of their respective filmographies.
  Neutral
