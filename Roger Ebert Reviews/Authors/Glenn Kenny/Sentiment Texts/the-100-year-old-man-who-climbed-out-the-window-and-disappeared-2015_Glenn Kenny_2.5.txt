Whats the highest grossing Swedish movie of all time?
  Positive
you ask.
  Neutral
Wait, no, you didnt ask?
  Negative
Well, too bad.
  Negative
The highest grossing Swedish movie of all time, apparently, is this one, new to U.S. release, and watching it, one can see why.
  Positive
The Swedish film industry is one of the oldest and most advanced in the world during the teens and s of the  th  century, its output was absolutely on a par with what the greatest innovators of the U.S. and France were up to but it is often associated with a kind of dourness, on account somewhat unfairly of  Ingmar Bergman and his death-occupied allegories.
  Positive
Even Swedens popular culture is pretty dark its from this country that the dark thrillers of Steig Larsson hail.
  Neutral
This movie, as it happens, is a comedy, but its a frequently grisly one, and one that makes rollicking fun of a lot of dark Swedish preoccupations.
  Very positive
Its plot is very neatly summed up by its title, which was also the title of the bestselling novel upon which it is based.
  Positive
The movie begins with a dynamite fuse crackling through the opening credits' then, its aged hero, Allan, puts his cat Molotov outside for a bit, and the poor kitty is killed by a coyote.
  Very negative
Allan takes his revenge by blowing up the offending creature.
  Neutral
This action lands him in a nursing home, out of whose window he climbs on his  th  birthday.
  Negative
The nursing home staff never finds him thats not really a spoiler, but we follow him on his subsequent adventure, which is intercut with his narration and flashbacks of his picaresque -year life.
  Negative
All I ever want to do is eat, sleep, and blow things up, Allan avers at one point.
  Negative
A cruelty inflicted on him in childhood precludes or at least inhibits romance, leaving him with those three easy-to-fulfill desires.
  Negative
The blowing-things-up part is part of what gave this story particular appeal to Swedes.
  Neutral
Sweden was, of course, the home of Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite whose subsequent guilt about it led to the Nobel Peace Prize.
  Negative
Swedens national character, apparently, is at least partially defined by the paradox that this peace-loving, ostensibly progressive country is most notable in  th -century world-historical terms for advancing the science of explosives.
  Negative
And so we see Allan cavorting through the century, blissfully free of ideology or perspective a more well-spoken, self-aware Forrest Gump, if you please encountering the likes of Franco and Oppenheimer and Stalin, and just happy to make things go boom the whole while.
  Positive
In the present day, he stumbles upon a suitcase full of cash, makes an accomplice of a rascally railway station agent, helps rescue a circus elephant, and more, all while thoroughly flummoxing a motorcycle gang who want the cash and the extremely understaffed and indolent police force thats pursuing him.
  Negative
That last element is a bit of a subtle counter to the depiction of Swedish cops in the aforementioned Steig Larsson books.
  Negative
Still you dont have to be Swedish to enjoy the film.
  Positive
The picaresque mode is one thats well-liked throughout Western culture, and this movie, directed by  Felix Herngren and starring popular Swedish comedian Robert Gustaffson, executes it reasonably well, with touches not just reminiscent of Gump but of  The Shawshank Redemption and other popular tall tales of our time.
  Very positive
It is ever so slightly more cynical and in-your-face with mordant humor than a mainstream American film would have been' the insouciant treatment of Allans first experiment with dynamite is more  Adam Rifkin than Robert Zemeckis.
  Negative
Such slight tonal eccentricities didnt quite do the trick for this reviewer, however.
  Negative
