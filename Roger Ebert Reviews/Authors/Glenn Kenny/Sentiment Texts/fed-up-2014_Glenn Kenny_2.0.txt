Are you a Peter Frampton fan?
  Neutral
And when I say "Peter Frampton fan," I mean a BIG Peter Frampton fan.
  Negative
I mean someone who goes back farther than his once-universally beloved  hit double-LP "Frampton Comes Alive."
  Neutral
I mean someone who maybe goes as far back as The Herd with Frampton, although not necessarily.
  Negative
Ill cut to the chase.
  Neutral
Are you someone who knows the  album called "Framptons Camel," and a track on it called "White Sugar"?
  Negative
Im asking this question because, if you are, and if you do, you can pretty much skip the movie "Fed Up," because Framptons song "White Sugar," the chorus of which condemns the titular substance as "evil as the day you were born" sums up the message of the new documentary "Fed Up" in a nutshell, or a teaspoon if you will.
  Negative
I dont mean to be glib.
  Negative
Or maybe I do.

As someone whos struggled on and off with weight issues ever since my metabolism betrayed me in my mid-twenties, I suppose Im in some ways a member of this movies target audience as an examination of Americas rising obesity stats and of the food industrys economic interest in encouraging, or even enforcing, unhealthy eating habits.
  Negative
Over the course of its ninety or so minutes, "Fed Up," executive produced by  Katie Couric who also narrates and Laurie David, and directed by  Stephanie Soechtig, offers up a lot of information about nutrition and the food industry, some of which I didnt know or had an only vague awareness of, and alternates talking head interviews with PhDs with mini-portraits of poignant obese kids and teens across this great land of ours.
  Negative
Along the way it explains why the magic words "low fat" arent so magic, how the calories from an almond metabolize differently than the calories from a sweetened soft drink, and why high fructose corn syrup and, yes, white sugar is as evil as the days they were born.
  Very negative
"I dont think high-fructose corn syrup is a good use of corn," former President Bill Clinton muses at one point in the film, going on to admit that his administration could have done more about this issue.
  Negative
Is it just me or has Clinton said that about a LOT of things his administration ended up not doing much about?
  Negative
Hell, and I like the guy.
  Negative
The movie pulls few punches in condemning collusion between the food industry and Congress and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and even Michelle Obamas anti-obesity initiative supposedly, if you read National Review, a sacrament for liberals  comes in for criticism for emphasizing the wrong sides of the issue.
  Negative
The information is arguably compelling, and disturbing, but something about the whole delivery mode turned me off.
  Neutral
As cinema, the movie is profoundly uninspired and commonplace, albeit well-made, or even slick.
  Negative
Im not sure whether the filmmakers knew that their slo-mo shots of sugar in heaping teaspoons is actually kind of mouth-watering, but there you go.
  Neutral
More irksome is the fact that Katie Couric and Laurie David, both of whose personal fortunes were achieved with no small participation from the Coca Cola Company, have now decided to impart to us peons that the Coca Cola Company is in fact the devil.
  Negative
When, in fact, the Coca Cola Company is merely doing something that a larger system aggressively enables it to do.
  Negative
Like most movies of its bent, "Fed Up" cant admit the thing that  Al Pacino gets so tetchy about at the climax of "And Justice For All...," which is that "the whole system is out of order."
  Negative
It cant wont see the forest for the trees, because it is in fact a product of the same system that produces Coca Cola.
  Positive
Why the viewer ought to trust it more than it trusts the Coca Cola Company is a question left unanswered.
  Negative
Anyway, I trust Peter Frampton.
