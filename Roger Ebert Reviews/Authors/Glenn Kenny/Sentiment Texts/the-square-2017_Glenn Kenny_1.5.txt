In the Sweden of  Ruben stlunds The Square, what was once Stockholms Royal Museum is now the X-Royal Museum, dedicated to contemporary art and its attendant values.
  Positive
The manner of the out-with-the-old, in-with-the-new change is conveyed in a scene in which workmen try to remove a statue of a horse and rider from the plaza in front of the museum' the statue, hoisted by the neck of its rider, breaks, decapitating the figure and ruining the plinth on which it once stood.
  Negative
In the plinths place is installed the title square, or Square, a small space enclosed by a white light strip.
  Negative
Part of a larger exhibition concocted by an artistsociologist, its meant to represent a communal safe space, so to speak.
  Positive
The Square is a sanctuary of trust and caring, says the artists statement.
  Negative
Within it, we all share equal rights and obligations.
  Positive
The museums chief curator, Christian, is now hard-pressed to sell the message, and the exhibition, to the public.
  Very positive
But Christian, a handsome, clearly accomplished professional played by  Claes Bang in a consistently committed performance thats probably the best thing in this largely misbegotten movie, is distracted.
  Positive
Hes distracted by Modern Life, or Postmodern Life, or whatever you want to call it.
  Negative
In a scene depicting Christians commute to work, writerdirector stlund unveils his on-the-nose approach to social satire via sledgehammer.
  Negative
He opens with a shot of a homeless man lying on a clean Stockholm sidewalk.
  Positive
On the soundtrack, a voice keeps asking, Would you like to save a life today?
  Positive
The voice, we see in a wider shot, belongs to one of those on-the-street clipboard-holding solicitors for subscriptions to social services.
  Positive
Yes, once again its WHAT INCREDIBLE IRONY time that guy is maybe dying just feet away, and heres this person asking passersby, who are both indifferent to her and the homeless guy, if they are interested in saving a life!
  Negative
Whoa!
  Neutral
The street scene resolves with Christian discovering hes been robbed of wallet, phone, and cufflinks.
  Negative
He cant believe the last part.
  Positive
With the help of a computer-savvy subordinate named Michael  Christopher Lss, Christian manages to track the phone, and he and Michael hatch an inane scheme to get it back by circulating a threatening letter in the housing project where the device has alit.
  Negative
This ploy actually works, but there are consequences, and while dealing with these consequences, Christian unthinkingly signs off on a marketing campaign concocted by a couple of cartoon Millennials.
  Negative
And this almost literally blows up in his face.
  Neutral
This is not a terribly plot-driven movie' indeed, at two hours and twenty minutes its rather a ramble.
  Very negative
The movie has to accommodate other anecdotes commenting on Modern Life, including Christians one-night-stand with an American journalist  Elisabeth Moss who inexplicably keeps a chimpanzee in her apartment and engages in a surprising game of tug-of-war with a condom post-coitus.
  Negative
Theres also an issue with one of the exhibitions, an installation of piles of gravel that the museums clean-up crew keeps inadvertently subtracting from after hours.
  Negative
stlund has a particular stylistic strategy for creating and ratcheting up tension in his scenes.
  Neutral
He establishes the parameters of a given exchange and then deliberately withholds reverse shots.
  Negative
A character will ask a question, and one expects the other character to answer, and instead, stlund holds the shot.
  Negative
The character waits.
  Neutral
The answer comes, but theres no cutaway.
  Negative
In the scene in which Christian and Michael go to the housing project with their letters, Michael nervously waits in the car, and hes approached by people on the street who knock on the windows, ask him about the car, and vaguely menace him.
  Negative
The camera never leaves the car, keeping Michael in anxious medium-close-up the whole time.
  Negative
This method is effective except when its not' then its just irritating.
  Negative
If you are asking why Christian did not just report the stolen phone to the police, well, thats interesting: the Sweden of this movie seems to have no police, or security guards, or doormen.
  Negative
When a performance art stunt at a gala dinner the movies signature set piece, I suppose goes horribly wrong on account of the artists unstoppable aggression, its up to the dinner guests to put a stop to it.
  Negative
Which of course they take an unconscionably long time to do, because, you know, Modern Life.
  Negative
Similarly, an irritated recipient of Christians letter, seeking payback, gets into Christians apartment building no problem, and creates large hassles therein.
  Negative
Okay, then, if thats the society stlund envisions, thats his privilege.
  Negative
Except the movie doesnt even obey its internal logic.
  Negative
The museums snooty overboss, Elna, played by Swedish musician  Marina Schiptjenko, is depicted in one scene as appalled by the viral video advertising for The Square exhibition' shes worried about funding, among other things.
  Very negative
In almost the very next scene she sits placidly and appreciatively while some of her benefactors are assaulted in the name of art.
  Negative
The conceptual-fish-in-a-barrel potshots at contemporary art alternate with an ostensible critique of masculinity and privilege, building to a climax that endorses a compassion thats mealy-mouthed and insufficient.
  Negative
For all the skill and polish on display, The Square is never anything beyond facile and pleased with itself.
  Negative
It says something unsettling about the times that the Palme dOr was awarded this year at Cannes to a work so flat-out reactionary.
  Neutral
