When  Mel Gibson was first becoming known as a film actor, he had a lot of obvious things going for him: acting talent, good looks, ruggedness, a charisma that could land on either side of sly or menacing.
  Positive
In other words, arguably, all the stardom requisites.
  Negative
But he was interesting beyond that, because of the movies he was in.
  Positive
Pictures such as Mad Max and  The Year of Living Dangerously were debatably genre pictures but they had energy and intelligence that was way beyond generic.
  Negative
It seemed also that Gibson had meaningful alliances with the makers of those films, directors  George Miller and  Peter Weir.
  Positive
Whether it was just happenstance that all these guys were coming up in the Australian film industry at the same time or if Gibson himself was indeed a more-discriminating-than-average film actor didnt matter' it looked good.
  Positive
And when Gibson made his big-Hollywood move in  Lethal Weapon he did, although its tough to really remember it properly now, play a pretty odd variant of the risk-everything-cop-hero.
  Negative
I dont need to rehash the personal explosions perpetrated by Gibson that, among other things, put his career in a kind of purgatory.
  Negative
I can infer, though, that a casual Gibson follower discovering that this week he stars in an action thriller called Blood Father might himself infer that Gibson is working his way out of that purgatory via the  Nicolas Cage route of hastily conceived and assembled shoot-em-up hackwork.
  Negative
I am pleased to report this is not actually the case.
  Negative
Clocking in at a fat-free  minutes, Blood Father, directed by  Jean-Franois Richet the man behind the  Vincent Cassel gangster epic Mesrine is an efficient and pleasurable bad-man-tries-to-go-good exposition that gives Gibson ample opportunity to flex his now-somewhat-grizzled movie-star muscle.
  Positive
The movie opens with a shot of a young girl in a missing-persons flyer, then cuts to a shot of a retail-market conveyer belt moving lots of boxes of bullets, and finally a pack of bubblegum.
  Positive
The young woman buying the stuff, Lydia  Erin Moriarty is the girl from the flyer' when she asks that a pack of Camel Lights be added to her purchase, the cashier asks her for proof of age.
  Negative
Get it?
  Neutral
Fortunately thats the movies first and last venture into coy Aint That Murica?
  Neutral
humor.
  Positive
Lydia delivers the ammo to a car full of her shady pals, including a slicked-down  Diego Luna, and theyre off on a pretty bad misadventure.
  Positive
Cut to a closeup of Gibson, his very lined face partially covered by a very full beard, making a confession in an AA meeting.
  Positive
Gibsons ex-con John Link is two years sober, has a vigilant sponsor named Kirby  William H. Macy, and runs a tattoo parlor out of a big trailer in a very sparsely populated California trailer park.
  Negative
And on the corkboard at the entry of the trailer is, yep, that missing persons flyer with young Lydias picture on it.
  Negative
So you know whos going to be on the other end of the line when the phone rings.
  Negative
Blood Father, written by  Peter Craig and  Andrea Berloff from a novel by Craig, avoids at least for the most part the clichs of the father-protects-daughter thrillers made famous by  Liam Neeson by giving the daughter a little bit of bad-apple-ness, or bad-assness, herself.
  Negative
Shes in a bad situation and shes also hooked on drugs and alcohol, so once Link swoops in to take her under his wing hes also got a rehab project to tackle.
  Negative
On top of which hes not a man of means theres no arsenal stashed under the floorboards of his trailer.
  Negative
For a time hes got only his wits to live by, and those have been somewhat scrambled by his life circumstances, not to mention the sudden reunion.
  Negative
Its refreshing to hear father and daughter cuss each other out and have neither one pause to make a remark about bad manners they both speak the same profane language.
  Negative
Which isnt to say Gibsons character is any kind of permissive dad.
  Negative
When Link and Lydia check into a motel together, a google-eyed young clerk  Thomas Mann asks conspiratorially, Whered you find her?
  Negative
In the delivery room, Gibson shoots back, implying with mere tone and speed all the ways hed kill the other guy if given an excuse.
  Negative
Just as the movie could use an infusion of villainy,  Michael Parks turns up as a former criminal associate of Links who now sells Nazi memorabilia online from his desolate ranch, and Parks makes a meal of the part.
  Negative
The movie builds up a good head of steam before delivering a very satisfying wrap-up, and the twist in the climax feels legitimate because Richet lets the audience understand that Links playing the only card hes got.
  Positive
Make what you will of how much Gibsons performance draws from his own wrestling of personal demons' suffice it to say that the line You cant be a prick all your life and just say never mind has a sting that wouldnt be there in a movie he wasnt starring in.
  Neutral
