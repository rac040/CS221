The world of R.L. Stine, the mega-best-selling author of VERY popular horror-but-you-know-for-kids books, is a very singular one.
  Negative
It is replete with cleverly conceived monsters that derive from classic adult or adult horror, but which are consistently and imaginatively skewed to a younger audiences taste and tolerance.
  Positive
The point is to supply the requisite, um, goosebumps, but not traumatizing nightmares.
  Negative
Stines success is well deserved, and his stories have been adapted for television and direct-to-video realms, among others.
  Positive
A feature film foray into that world is a potentially challenging gig, but director  Rob Letterman, aided by writers  Scott Alexander and  Larry Karaszewski and  Darren Lemke and an energetic cast, rise to the occasion, delivering a movie thats a lot of good creepy fun in spite of some dubious construction.
  Very positive
Scenarists Alexander and Karaszewski go big by constructing a meta-narrative that can contain an incredible number of Stines cheekyscary monsters.
  Negative
The story begins with  Amy Ryans educator mom Gale driving her and discontented son Zach Dylan Minette to their new home in what the kid believes to be the dullest spot in the known world, let alone Delaware.
  Negative
Things perk up a bit with the appearance of cute teen girl-next-door Hannah  Odeya Rush but get hectic when Hannahs tetchy, eccentric dad  Jack Black butts in.
  Neutral
At school, a wide-eyed nerd named Champ and referred to as Chump by the rest of his class  Ryan Lee makes fast friends with Zach, and the two determine to find out exactly whats up with the new neighbors.
  Negative
Its pretty plain that a big chunk of the movie got cut in order to get to the monster stuff faster, and the narrative does take some lumps on account of this.
  Negative
It turns out that Black is actually  R.L. Stine, or R.L. Stine, and what makes his books so good is that the monsters in them are real theyre only contained when the manuscripts of the books in which they appear are bound and sealed.
  Negative
When Zachs snooping accidentally unleashes an abominable snowman, a ventriloquist dummy named Slappy a veritable doppelgnger for Blacks Stine becomes the ringleader of an army of now-free creatures.
  Negative
Slappys plan is to take some sort of unspecified revenge on his, and their, creator, and wreak havoc on the town while theyre at it.
  Negative
And so we get a series of horror set-pieces that are toned-down variants on the comedy horror scarefests of recent years.
  Negative
The scene in which Stine, Zach, Hannah, and Champ try to elude a gym-shorts-sporting werewolf in a supermarket evokes both  The Shining and  Zombieland," while being milder than either.
  Negative
Speaking of The Shining, that book and its author are the subjects of several knowing and funny in jokes' the movies full of them.
  Positive
Although my conviction that the army of toy robots seen in a couple of shots is based on the toy designed by  Fred MacMurray in  Douglas Sirks s melodrama Theres Always Tomorrow might be a stretch on my part.
  Negative
In any event, all the creatures, which range from the tiny robots to looming freeze-gun toting aliens to a giant mantis, are rendered very nicely in realistic computer animation, while the live-action cast is always engaging and often very funny.
  Positive
Stines character frequently refers to the all-important twist he builds into each story, and this movie has a twist of its own, a pretty daring one that expands on the initial reflexivity of the plot itself, while also making a convincingly heartfelt statement about the power of imagination and its earnest exercise.
  Very positive
Lest I make this sound too heavy, its really not' the movie is breezy and fun, offering thrills for kids and a nicely nostalgic matinee vibe for adults.
  Positive
