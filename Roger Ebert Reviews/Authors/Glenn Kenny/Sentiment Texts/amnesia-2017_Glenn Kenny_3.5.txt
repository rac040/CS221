Even had he never deigned to become a director,  Barbet Schroeder would be a towering figure in cinema.
  Negative
As a young man in the early s, he co-founded, with his friend  Eric Rohmer, a production company called Les Films du Losange, which produced some of the greatest French films of the second half of the  th  century.
  Positive
Or all of the  th  century, honestly.
  Neutral
I think of all time might apply.
  Neutral
His personal producer credit has been attached to masterpieces such as Rohmers The Marquise of O, Fassbinders Chinese Roulette, Rivettes Celine and Julie Go Boating in which the dashingly handsome Schroeder also appears as an actor those three in a mere two-year span between  and .
  Negative
So yeah, hes a hero of film even without his directorial filmography.
  Positive
Which by my lights is pretty heroic, and often underrated.
  Positive
He began his directing career with s  More, a vivid, unsparing fictional portrait of a hippie couple whose dreams of a utopian life in Ibiza wither pretty quickly under the weight of heroin addiction.
  Positive
He continued, toggling between fiction and documentary and revealing an interest in perverseoverstepping states of being that verged on the anthropological if not sociological.
  Positive
His  documentary on the murderous African dictator, named after its subject, General Idi Amin Dada, showed that Schroeder was a lot more than an outsider looking in.
  Negative
Yes, he used a bit of trickery to get close to his subject, offering him the chance to make an autoportrait, but Schroeder also put himself in harms way with his subterfuge.
  Negative
Once his directing career moved to Hollywood, his studies in human perversity, which include pictures like  Barfly and  Reversal of Fortune, made him one of the most interesting European directors working here.
  Positive
By my lights even his less successful efforts, such as  Murder by Numbers, have a certain undercurrent of danger that gives them intrigue.
  Negative
His latest fictional film, Amnesia, finds him back in Ibiza, but the prevailing tone as the movie opens is placid, almost contemplative.
  Negative
Marthe Keller,  at the time of the movies making, comes into a sumptuous sunset walking with a cane, looking substantially older.
  Negative
And the movie immediately hopscotches back in time, to a decade-plus prior.
  Negative
Kellers character, named Martha, is speaking English to a man whos speaking German to her, pestering her about a property in Germany whose sale she is required to supervise in person, in that country.
  Negative
Shes not having it.
  Negative
A self-imposed exile from her country, she now lives on Ibiza, the island on which Schroeder directed his first movie.
  Negative
We learn that she refuses to speak German, to drink German wine, or even to ride in a German car.
  Negative
Nazism compelled her to renounce all things German.
  Neutral
Not that, for the most part, she makes a big deal of it.
  Negative
Her island life is simple.
  Positive
She lives in a beautiful house with a beautiful view that has no electricity.
  Positive
Off the grid, she has a pleasant social life with longtime neighbors.
  Positive
But a new neighbor has recently moved in.
  Positive
Jo Gellert, a musician who calls himself DJ Gello, is settling in Ibiza to make a name in electronic dance music the island is still a well-known vacationparty spot attracting a lot of trendy revelers.
  Very positive
Jo, played by  Max Riemelt, is good-looking, friendly, open-minded and openhearted.
  Positive
Hes also German.
  Neutral
He and Martha take an immediate, almost electric liking to each other.
  Positive
Kellers portrayal of her characters flirty, light side is very disarming' you can see why Jo falls for Martha, and hard.
  Negative
The performers chemistry helps the movie roll over some of its more on-the-nose dialogue.
  Positive
When Martha explains her antipathy towards Germany to him, he pushes back slightly, but he comes to find her conviction admirable.
  Positive
As does the viewer.
  Neutral
For the first hour, the movie blends a pleasant story of Platonic love with more disquieting themes of history and memory.
  Positive
Speaking of on-the-nose, the club where DJ Gello hopes to make his splash is itself called Amnesia.
  Negative
Forgivable in light of the fact that it is the real name of a the real Ibiza club featured.
  Positive
Things get more fraught when Jo gets a visit from his physician mother Corinna Kirchoff, who wants to convince Jo to return to Germany to be part of the changes in the now no-longer-divided country.
  Negative
Mom brings with her Jos beloved grandfather, played by  Bruno Ganz.
  Positive
And Ganzs character, also named Bruno, has a secret from the war years, one that Martha icily draws out of him.
  Negative
Schroeders film style has always been foursquare and straightforward, but hes capable of some striking effects within his planispokenness.
  Positive
One of the movies most striking moments finds Bruno standing on the patio of Jos house, having come to a critical juncture in a war story hes telling.
  Positive
Martha, from inside the house, asks, What happened to the girls?
  Positive
and her disembodied voice at that point seems like that of Brunos conscience.
  Neutral
The writing of this scene, though, and Ganzs magnificent performance, also has the effect of making Marthas stance and indignation look petty, imperious.
  Positive
It is reported that this movies scenario was inspired by the life of Schroeders own mother, and the film has a personal tone that is not always detectable in his other movies.
  Negative
It enhances a film thats one of the most thoughtful in his body of work.
  Very positive
