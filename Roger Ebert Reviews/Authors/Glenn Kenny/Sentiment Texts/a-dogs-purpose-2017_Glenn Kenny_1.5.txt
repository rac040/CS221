The recording artist Steve Albini once described a particularly onerous music-industry assignment as a job I wouldnt wish on a dog I didnt like.
  Negative
Right now, I feel like that dog, because I have to review A Dogs Purpose.
  Negative
The assignment didnt look so bad until about a week ago, when animal rights activists Or was it TMZ?
  Negative
Or some combination thereof?
  Neutral
Who can rightly say?
  Neutral
made public a video of one of the movies several dogs balking at performing a stunt, and being mocked for its ostensible cowardice before being forced to act.
  Negative
Instantly, the prospect of two hours of lookatdapuppy became the prospect of two hours of lookatdapuppythatmighthavebeenabused and seriously, who wants to sit through, let alone offer some kind of objective professional assessment, of that?
  Negative
On the other hand, that girl slapping the cat around in Satantango was really slapping a cat around, and somehow I dont think the horse that was standing on the platform of the wooden staircase that collapsed in Andrei Rublev got up and trotted away.
  Negative
Dont even get me started on that pig in Bertoluccis , although I presume he was enjoyed by those who eventually ate him in the form of tasty sausage.
  Negative
But A Dogs Purpose, directed by  Lasse Hallstrm, who also directed My Life as a Dog not really a dog movie and Hachi: A Dogs Tale absolutely a dog movie, is not supposed to be a realistic depiction of the misfortune our differently-individuated fellow creatures fall into in this world.
  Very negative
No, it is meant to be an inspirational tale based on the notion that dogs exist to be of service to humans.
  Negative
And that one dog, the one whose voiceover is enthusiastically articulated by  Josh Gad, gets reincarnated a sufficient number of times to fulfill the purpose of redeeming the existence of his former master.
  Positive
This is one weird movie.
  Negative
Co-produced by Amblin,  Steven Spielbergs production shingle, it begins in a Michigan early s thats been production-design burnished to a nostalgic fare-thee-well.
  Negative
Nevertheless, this idyllic depiction of America when it was Great Before features rogue sanitation workers who come upon a Red Retriever puppy and reckon they can make a few bucks selling it  only they leave it to dehydrate in their vehicle as they go to lunch.
  Negative
Along comes young Ethan and his feisty mom  Juliet Rylance to rescue the pup, give him water, and adopt him, despite the doubts of good-natured but hard-drinking traveling salesman dad.
  Negative
Things move amiably enough, but the slapstick involving rambunctious Bailey for so is the pup named often escalates to a level that would get another dog sent to two weeks at a training camp or something.
  Neutral
When the humor isnt overstated, its kinda inappropriate.
  Negative
Teenage Ethan eventually meets a girl, Hannah  Britt Robertson, and the cutie is charmed by Bailey, whos curious about her and her smell.
  Negative
She grabs the dog by his shiny, lustrous scuff and scratches under his neck.
  Neutral
In voiceover, Bailey says My butt itches.
  Negative
Great.
  Positive
Just what the world needs, Old Yeller rewritten by  The Hangover team.
  Negative
Not actually true' no Hangover writers were employed in the making of this film.
  Negative
Then things get real dark real fast.
  Neutral
Dads hard drinking becomes full-blown shambling and striking-out alcoholism.
  Negative
This is all the more disturbing since, if youve been following the cause and effect action closely, its strongly implied that the guy lost his job partially on account of the dogs bad behavior.
  Negative
Ethans envious, resentful football teammate pulls a prank that causes appalling damage.
  Negative
All of Ethans All-American hopes and dreams and optimism are snatched from him, and off he goes to a lonely life at agricultural school.
  Negative
Yikes.
  Neutral
Then Bailey dies, and the movies next hour is about the different forms the dog takes before finding his ultimate purpose.
  Negative
Theres the German Shepherd police dog the one in the TMZ video whose human master is lonesome.
  Negative
This one has the misfortune of having to chase a kidnapper whos also an acrobat, given his police-evading climbing abilities whos brought his victim to a reservoir, and proves a hero in the noblest and kind of depressing way possible.
  Negative
And yeah, that water does look damn scary, for German Shepherd or human or whoever.
  Positive
Theres the ice-cream loving Corgi I think who helps find romance for his over-studious mistress Kirby Howell Baptiste.
  Negative
Then theres the dog adopted by a rural punk rock chick theyre the worst whose neglect is so dire it can barely be voiceovered.
  Negative
But wait!
  Positive
This dog finds freedom, and eventually finds Ethan, who has grown up to look just like  Dennis Quaid.
  Positive
Oddly enough, though, hes not had a girlfriend since Hannah.
  Negative
And so Bailey finds his ultimate purpose.
  Positive
No, really.
  Negative
This movie has its moments no movie with such an adorable array of pooches could not, plus Mr. Quaid, who in addition to being movie-star handsome is also a pretty good actor, sells his fifteen or so onscreen minutes.
  Negative
But the tonal weirdness and the philosophical fallacies and the general level of treacle did not sit very well with me.
  Negative
Then again, I have to admit Im really more of a cat person.
  Neutral
