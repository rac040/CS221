Colm Tibns  novel Brooklyn is one of those books that seems like a miracle, a book that reminds the reader just how much power can reside in relatively unadorned language.
  Positive
The Irish-born writers book tells the story of Eilis Lacey, a young woman from a working family circa .
  Positive
Shes bright, open and industrious, and theres not much meaningful opportunity for her in her small Irish town.
  Negative
An Irish priest visiting from the United States sponsors Eilis for a job in the books title borough, and Tibn beautifully tells of her uncomfortable crossing, her loneliness and alienation in her new world, how she finds her own way and finds romance, and what happens after shes called back to her old home away from the place where shes been working so hard to make good.
  Negative
The story is simple, and told in a quiet register.
  Positive
Tibn, who recently wrote a book celebrating the work of the poet Elizabeth Bishop, has both a novelists love of detail and a poets facility for linguistic magic-by-compression.
  Positive
He uses every word carefully, and every sentence is where it is for a very particular reason' therefore hes able to weigh those sentences with intimations that are genuinely metaphysical.
  Positive
Take the opening sentence of Part Two of the novel: In January, Eilis felt the fierce sharp cold in the mornings as she went to work.
  Neutral
Thats not a barrage of verbal fireworks by any means' one notices that Tibn declined to separate the words fierce and sharp with a comma, and that adds to the speed of the sentence, but otherwise it seems well-wrought but ordinary enough.
  Negative
But given where it falls in the sequence of prose, and what follows the sentence ... well, in that context it evokes a whole small world of distress.
  Positive
I had heard many good things about the film adaptation of Brooklyn before I saw it, but I did wonder whether the film would even try to bring this dimension to the screen.
  Negative
Im happy to report that screenwriter  Nick Hornby himself a novelist of note and director  John Crowley do, on occasion throughout the wonderful film, aim to do that, and succeed.
  Neutral
The director and screenwriter have been gifted with an extraordinary lead actor.
  Very positive
In the role of Eilis,  Saoirse Ronan is as alert, intelligent, and emotionally alive as the character herself.
  Positive
Ronan, herself a native of Ireland, has, in this movie, put on a very, if youll excuse the expression, Irish-girl face: open, clear-eyed, with a not-hard jawline thats nonetheless set with a certain kind of determination.
  Negative
Its the furthest thing from forbidding, but it also sends a clear message: shell brook no nonsense.
  Positive
Eilis is also of course terribly vulnerable.
  Negative
In the film she has a beloved mam and older sister the adaptation excises the older brothers in the novel and once shes ensconced in a quasi-boarding house in a nicely brownstone-and-tree-rich neighborhood of the New York borough to which shes sailed, she misses them terribly.
  Negative
The movie has a spectacularly good sense of place and time without being too obvious about it' Eilis circumstances are cozy, slightly catty, and a little stifling.
  Positive
Once she meets a super-friendly Italian-American fellow named Tony  Emory Cohen, so wonderful here that Im now inclined to blame his baleful work in s also baleful The Place Beyond The Pines entirely on that films director, her initiation into New-Yorker-dom begins.
  Negative
Screenwriter Hornby breaks out the interiority of Tibns book by inventing some apt bits that result in heart-warmingly funny scenes.
  Negative
Eilis gets lessons from her roommates in eating spaghetti, and the role of Tonys smart-alecky but essentially sweet younger brother Frankie is expanded purposefully' the actor playing the eight-going-on-eighteen character, James DiGiacomo, is a certified scene-stealer.
  Negative
Just as things are getting serious between Tony and Eilis, she is called back to her home to cope with a family tragedy.
  Negative
As much as shes come to love her new life, the forces of homesickness and guilt, as well as the attentions of the kind, handsome local fellow Jim Farrell  Domhnall Gleeson, worlds away from the feckless cyber-nerd he plays in this years  Ex Machina cause no small confusion for Eilis.
  Negative
Her inner conflict is played out with terrific sensitivity and understatement, but the director and the actors deliver the final click of the plots tumblers with no small emotional force.
  Positive
Its a quietly devastating moment that, like much else in the movie, has a resonance that extends far beyond its immediate circumstances.
  Positive
While Tibns novel feels very much rooted in the time in which its set, the movie has more the feel of what  Tennessee Williams calls a memory play.
  Positive
Im sure that the excursion-to-a-Coney-Island-day-at-the-beach scenes in the  comedy The Devil And Miss Jones or the  Imitation of Life, as Hollywoodized as they were, presented more realistic versions of such excursions than this movie does I mean, Coney Island iswas a lot of things, but lyrical is not one of them.
  Negative
The Brooklyn colloquial description of the location would be something along the lines of zoo.
  Neutral
As a choice, though, it serves the movies vision well.
  Positive
If I may be utterly, unabashedly frank, I admit that the first time I saw this picture I started crying about forty minutes in and never really stopped.
  Negative
They were not all sad tears, I hasten to add.
  Negative
The persistent feeling that this movie so beautifully creates is that even when the world is bestowing blessings upon us, its still at the bottom a sad place, and the key to an emotionally healthy existence involves some rooted acceptance of that.
  Positive
The movie ends with Eilis having made some substantial steps to that accepting place, and also determined to move purposefully forward.
  Positive
People have spoken about how understated and old-fashioned Brooklyn is, to the extent that it might come across as a pleasant innocuous entertainment.
  Positive
Dont be fooled.
  Neutral
Brooklyn isnot toothless.
  Negative
But it is big-hearted, romantic and beautiful.
  Positive
