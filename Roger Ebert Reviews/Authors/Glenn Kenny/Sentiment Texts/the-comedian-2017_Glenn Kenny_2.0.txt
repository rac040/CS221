The producer and sometime writerdirector  Art Linson is a man of taste he helped get  Melvin and Howard, Heat, and a bunch of other great, good, or notable films get made and also a veritable mother lode of showbiz lore.
  Negative
His  book, an almost-tell-all called What Just Happened?
  Negative
was one of the juicier reads for connoisseurs of Hollywood Inside Baseball.
  Negative
The book was adapted into a movie in , and despite having  Barry Levinson as director, the result was a bit of a sprawl, albeit with some entertaining bits and pieces.
  Negative
The Comedian, a Linson production directed by  Taylor Hackford, and also starring  Robert De Niro, who took the lead in the movie of What Just Happened?
  Negative
and has a long-standing relationship with the producer, is similarly beset by a focus problem, and thats not all.
  Negative
This new installment in what could be a continuing Linson semi-franchise Art Linsons Tales of Showbiz has a whole hell of a lot going for it in the individual ingredients department.
  Negative
Linson provided the storyline, which no doubt has any number of a clef elements.
  Neutral
The co-screenwriters include  Jeffrey Ross, the comedian and Friars Club figurehead who knows where dozens of bodies are buried, the great Richard LaGravenese, and  Lewis Friedman, a veteran showbiz gagman and another repository of outrageous tales.
  Positive
Hackford has more than a few first-rate pictures under his belt, including s  Ray and the underseen Blood In, Blood Out.
  Positive
And the cast is spectacular, by  standards and by those of .
  Positive
Robert De Niro,  Danny DeVito,  Harvey Keitel reuniting with De Niro for the first time since, um, Little Fockers in  if Im not mistaken,  Charles Grodin,  Patti Lupone,  Cloris Leachman and more, with  Edie Falco and  Leslie Mann playing the teen roles, relatively speaking.
  Negative
And two raft loads of cameos from real-life comedy legends as themselves.
  Negative
But the movie never builds enough momentum, emotional or narrative, to get the viewer on its side.
  Negative
De Niro plays Jackie Burke, an aging comic at a career impasse.
  Negative
Like so many movies with aging casts, this one makes a lot of hay out of seniors trying to cope with the digital world.
  Negative
Jackie doesnt do such a good job of coping when, one night at a sparsely attended gig, he discovers that a couple of hecklers are razzing him not just for the hell of it, but to provide fodder for their YouTube or something series.
  Negative
Jackie head-butts the guy in indignation and winds up battling an assault charge.
  Negative
During his community service the battle didnt go his way' he also ended up doing thirty days he finds himself serving at a food kitchen alongside Manns Harmony, the troubled daughter of a one-time mobster played by Keitel.
  Negative
The two strike up a friendship that one desperately hopes does not blossom into a romance, while Jackie juggles money troubles, opportunities for gigs, and other challenges in a way that suggest that he thrives on self-defeat in a sense.
  Negative
One of the movies problems is that it really doesnt make clear the particulars of Jackies situation early on.
  Negative
We know that he had once acted the role of  Eddie in a popular television sitcom, and that the quasi-Honeymooners show made his name, his fandom, and whatevers left of his fortune.
  Negative
But his existentialartistic quandary only becomes clear as the movie continues.
  Negative
By the time we seem Manns character looking at a vintage vinyl LP titled The Mind of Jackie Burke do we understand that Jackie, more than being just a comic who worked blue but got a family television show anyway think  Bob Saget was not just a shock comic but a social commentator think  George Carlin or even Lenny Bruce.
  Negative
Hackford gives us a lot of nice character notes for Jackie I particularly liked the scene where hes ironing his own clothes while listening to a very obscure Art Blakey LP, but saving this context for last leaves the character, and some of his decisions, a little murky.
  Neutral
Then theres De Niro himself.
  Neutral
The actor has been in a lot of less than good movies over the years, but rarely, or relatively rarely, has he been in movies in which his performance could be cited as a key problem, or lack.
  Negative
Pauline Kael famously excoriated his work in s  True Confessions, writing He could be a potato, except hes thoroughly absorbed in the process of doing nothing.
  Negative
But she was a minority voice.
  Neutral
As for De Niros work here, it is quite peculiar.
  Neutral
In certain individual scenes, playing off DeVito as his much-beset brother, or Keitels boorish patriarchal non-fan, or Grodin as an estranged colleague, he gets a good spark going, at least for a while.
  Negative
But he cant figure Burke out as a stand-up.
  Negative
He pitches his delivery somewhere awkwardly between his legendary King of Comedy wannabe Rupert Pupkin and his legendary  Midnight Run wisecracking bounty hunter  Jack Walsh.
  Negative
And in a scene thats sure to be widely cited, and widely disdained, he leads the members of a senior home in a profanely altered rendition of Makin Whoopee with the ill-advised relish of his work as Fearless Leader in that Rocky and Bullwinkle film of which I try not to speak of anymore.
  Negative
And its in this cartoonish mode that the movie ultimately ends, as he looks on proudly while the end result of a drunken evening of ill-advised whoopee cops the comedians style.
  Negative
You have to see this coda to believe it.
  Neutral
