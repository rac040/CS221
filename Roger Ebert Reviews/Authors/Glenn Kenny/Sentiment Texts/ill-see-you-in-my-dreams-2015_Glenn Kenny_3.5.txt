Its always a pleasure to see  Blythe Danner in a movie.
  Positive
And its even more of a pleasure to see Blythe Danner in a good movie.
  Positive
No, not a good movie.
  Neutral
Areallygood movie.

Which Ill See You In My Dreams actually is, its iffy but explainable title notwithstanding.
  Negative
The actress claims shes always been more at home on the stage than in films, despite the fact that her combined TV and motion picture credits total over .
  Negative
Still, this terrific, attractive actress hasnt had too many leading-lady star turns in her filmography, and her most recent screen work has involved being a stolid second or third banana to the likes of  Robert De Niro and  Ben Stiller in the increasingly dire comedies spawned by s  Meet The Parents.
  Positive
The descriptives surrounding Ill See You In My Dreams might read like trigger warnings to a dyspeptic movie maven.
  Negative
Sundance hit, indie drama, senior romance.
  Negative
I admit I myself went in with a slight amount of trepidation.
  Neutral
But it was clear from the opening, in which Danners character, Carol has to put her beloved dog to sleep, that the -year-old Danner, was going to carry the movie, and that wascomforting.
  Negative
The long-widowed Carol has a pretty well-ordered life.
  Positive
She gets up early in the morning, does the housekeeping she needs to do, has a regular bridge game with some old friends who live at a nearby senior community, and so on.
  Positive
But shes a bit disconnected from her friends, because shes opted to live in a house of her own, and after the dog is gone, her lifes a little more lonely.
  Negative
Disorder enters in the form of a black rat in the house' Carol asks the new pool-cleaning guy, Lloyd  Martin Starr, to investigate.
  Negative
A weird, tentative friendship starts blooming between the aimless, bearded, much younger Lloyd and Carol.
  Negative
He takes her out to a karaoke bar where her long-lost identity as a singer reasserts itself in an impressive way, as CarolBlythe really lays into Cry Me A River.
  Positive
The pair looks askance at each other when the idea of a romance rears its head theres an age difference of like four decades here!
  Negative
but then you think you see them thinking, Well, why not?
  Negative
Before that question gets past the implied stage, Carol, after a disastrous senior-speed-dating session, accepts a date request from Bill, whos played by  Sam Elliott.
  Negative
Being played by Sam Elliott in itself implies a lot, and his Bill is a laid-back delight, taking Carol out on his boat, which hes christened So What, after the  Miles Davis tune.
  Positive
When Carol picks up the reference, Bill is duly impressed, and its, um, smooth sailing for their romance.
  Negative
Until its not.
  Neutral
Co-written and directed by  Brett Haley, Ill See You In My Dreams is notable for its tempered sweetness and never on-the-nose wisdom.
  Positive
It makes genuine cinematic hay of scenarios that  out of one hundred other filmmakers would play for cheap look-at-the-old-people laughs.
  Positive
The aforementioned speed-dating sequence, for instance, is cut together with the conventional multiple-talking-heads interspersing, but its more purposeful and compassionate than any other scenes using that strategy Ive ever seen.
  Positive
Similarly, a scene in which Carol, having decided to live a little, asks one of her girlfriends where she keeps her stash of medical marijuana, the ensuing scenes, featuring contemporary golden girls  Rhea Perlman,  Mary Kay Place, and  June Squibb, are genuinely funny and touching, not to mention behaviorally accurate.
  Negative
One shudders to think how such material would play out in the hands of, say,  Luke Greenfield or  Greg Berlanti, but one doesnt have to think of such things, as the material is so beautifully handled here.
  Positive
Carols new lease on life leads to her being nearly blindsided by a visit from her daughter Katherine  Malin Akerman.
  Negative
Their pleasant but wary interplay suggests hidden depths in their relationship, but here-and-now events detour their conversation, and then bring things to a new level.
  Positive
Unlike a lot of film-festival-friendly indies that emphasize character studies, Ill See You In My Dreams has a very definite and sturdy narrative, and its a well-handled one that deserves to be discovered by viewers.
  Negative
While I was indeed moved by the films gentle conclusions with respect to life and aging, I was on the whole more impressed by how genuinely amiable the movie is: its an hour and a half spent with fictionalized people who are a real pleasure to be with.
  Positive
That is no small thing.
  Negative
