It occurs to me that s  Bad Santa inadvertently provided the connective tissue between the genuinely subversive comedies of  John Waters and the slack, fake-transgressive gross-out comedies currently in vogue,  Neighbors : Sorority Rising and the films of the Hangover franchise among them.
  Negative
Coming a long  years after the original, Bad Santa  provides, perhaps inadvertently, some backup evidence for my thesis.
  Negative
The original Bad Santa, starring  Billy Bob Thornton in the career-high title role the characters actual name is Willie Stokes, but few in the movie or outside of it ever actually call him that, was a scrappy indie movie, directed by  Terry Zwigoff and executive produced by Joel and  Ethan Coen, a deliberately nasty fusion of heist picture and black comedy with a touch of redemptive storytelling that elevated it to nearly-humanist.
  Negative
Albeit in a very cranky way.
  Positive
While the movie did not cross the -million box office mark domestically, it did a little better than what youd call a cult movie.
  Negative
The Bad Santa brand is strong in other places that count.
  Neutral
Just look at the cast for the sequel: Thornton,  Tony Cox, and poor  Brett Kelly who played the sad but highly unappealing role of snotnose kid Thurman Merman are back, and newbies include such luminaries as  Kathy Bates and  Christina Hendricks.
  Very negative
Octavia Spencer shows up for a cameo, playing a hooker who is hired to divest now--year-old-Thurman of his cherry.
  Negative
Bob Dylans version of Winter Wonderland appears on the soundtrack.
  Negative
Think about it: Bob Dylan cant be bothered to go to Sweden to pick up his Nobel Prize, but hell let the Bad Santa sequel use one of his songs.
  Negative
This sequel is directed by  Mark Waters, whose  Mean Girls strongly suggested that he knows funny.
  Negative
His subsequent filmography, which includes Mr. Poppers Penguins, strongly suggests lost mojo.
  Negative
Its clear from the get-go here that Waters is not so strong on areas in which Zwigoff excelled, like credible characterization.
  Negative
But for the demands of this particular movie at this particular time, here he doesnt really have to be.
  Negative
The movie begins with Thorntons Willie once again in the grip of alcoholism-fueled depression and flirting hard with suicide.
  Negative
Hes saved by a seemingly inopportune visit from now-neighbor Thurman, who brings tidings from Coxs Marcus.
  Negative
Willie is less than thrilled to hear from his one-time partner in crime viewers of the first film will recall that things between the two did not end well then and even less thrilled upon being persuaded to visit Chicago, where Willie learns the brains behind a new job is his long-estranged criminal mother, Sunny Bates.
  Negative
The trio is going undercover to rob a popular and lucrative childrens charity, but its alright, really, because the crooked head of the charity skims almost all their earnings for his own enrichment anyway.
  Negative
Said head has a beautiful wife, played by Hendricks, whos entirely innocent and also a recovering alcoholic.
  Negative
She takes some pity on Willie, who has trouble holding things together even as hes casing the joint.
  Negative
You see how all these components are supposed to line up, and then fall, right?
  Negative
Of course you do.
  Neutral
As with so many comedies of its ilk these days, the story in Bad Santa, such as it is, serves little more purpose than a straight line on which to hang a lot of gags.
  Negative
This is not a formula thats exclusive to contemporary comedies: it applies to a lot of Marx Brothers movies too.
  Negative
But such things are always execution-dependent, which in this case is a fancy way of saying the jokes had all better be good.
  Negative
Its this distinction that makes  Duck Soup a classic and Go West not so much in the case of the Marxes.
  Positive
As for Bad Santa, its joke batting average is about .
  Negative
.
  Neutral
And Im being generous here.
  Positive
Even when the jokes dont work, Thornton in curmudgeon mode is hard to resist.
  Negative
He can make an utterly unfunny line such as Are you a complete fking retard dryly amusing, which I guess is kind of the point.
  Negative
Similarly, Bates and Cox clearly enjoy the interplay with Thornton, so much so that I was surprised not to see a gag reel over the end credits.
  Negative
It certainly would have been preferable to what IS seen over the end credits, a gross-out gag inspired by a practice first alluded to in popular culture in a John Waters film, as it happens.
  Negative
That movie would be  Pecker.
  Neutral
However.
  Neutral
Particularly in its portrayal of Thurman, who here isnt so much misunderstood and unloved as he is dumber than a bag of rocks, this sequel actively devalues the compassion-on-the-knife-edge-of-misanthropy that distinguished the original in favor of a mainstream gross-out cartoon.
  Negative
The market demands nothing less, apparently.
