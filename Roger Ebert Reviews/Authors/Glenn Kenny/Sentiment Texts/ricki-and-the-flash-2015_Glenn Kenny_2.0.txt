Ricki and the Flash is a classic, and classically lamentable, good-newsbad news proposition.
  Positive
In the good news department, its largely a sturdy, enjoyable domestic comedy drama.
  Positive
It showcases the sort of typically amazingly diverse and eclectic cast only its director  Jonathan Demme can and would put together.
  Positive
Whens the last time you saw a movie that featured both The Facts of Life mother-figure  Charlotte Rae AND ParliamentFunkadelic keyboard legend Bernie Worrell?
  Negative
Thats right, never.
  Negative
Then theres the what-cant-she-do  Meryl Streep credibly handling a Fender Telecaster and singing classic rock tunes.
  Neutral
A script by  Diablo Cody thats typically acute on the Problems Of Quirky Contemporary Women front and refreshingly low on the ostentatious gratuitous pop culture references.
  Positive
And so on.
  Neutral
The bad news is tougher to detail in good conscience as a spoiler-aware reviewer.
  Negative
The movie, not nearly as treacly a proposition as its trailers suggest, opens with Streeps Ricki leading her band through Tom Pettys American Girl.
  Negative
If these guys rock a little harder and tighter than your above-average bar band, its because they damn well should.
  Negative
Lead guitarist and some-time Ricki romantic interest Greg is  Rick Springfield, a chart-topping dude back in the day as well as an actor' bassist is the late Rick Rosas, longtime compatriot of  Neil Young and others' the drummer is Joe Vitale, who came up with the Michael Stanley Band.
  Negative
On organ is the aforementioned Mr. Worrell.
  Neutral
These vets, even onetime teen idol Springfield, are all relatively grizzled looking, but theyre making the smallish clientele of a Tarzana bar pretty happy.
  Negative
The next day its back to real life for frontwoman Ricki: a checkout lane at a Total Foods outlet, a fictionalized version of a very organic chain with high Awful Bourgeois Appeal.
  Negative
Then theres the phone call from the past.
  Neutral
Theres always a phone call from the past.
  Positive
In this case, its from a past standing on a manicured lawn in the back of a McMansion in a cul de sac and calling Ricki Linda her given name.
  Negative
Kevin Klines Pete is the ex-husband Ricki left in the lurch after bearing him three children and failing at domestic goddesshood.
  Negative
But its quite a lurch hes made for himself.
  Negative
Still ensconced in Indiana, he has a challenging but very lucrative professional life, a beautiful and sane second wife Maureen Audra MacDonald and is still an involved dad to this three adult kids.
  Positive
The oldest of which, Julie  Mamie Gummer, Streeps real-life daughter is having a profound crisis after the breakup of her marriage.
  Positive
Absentee mom RickiLinda, who hasnt boarded a jet since well before the creation of the TSA, does her duty and is greeted with surly resentment and seething hatred by Julie.
  Very negative
Except Ricki also works some transformational magic on her daughter, routing her rage into a pleasure principle that involves getting pricey manicures on Julies soon-to-be-ex-husbands dime.
  Positive
Rickis other kids are a little less ambivalent about her sudden presence' it comes out that the youngest hadnt even intended to invite her to his wedding.
  Negative
And once Maureen returns from visiting her own family, shes not too excited that Rickis around either.
  Negative
So far, so okay.
  Positive
One of the nicer things about the movie is how it avoids overt clichs while still partaking of convention.
  Negative
One night in the giant kitchen Ricki asks buttoned-down Pete why hes got some pot in the freezer' he said it was bootleg-prescribed by a coworker for his migraines.
  Negative
The way for a WACKY pot-smoking scene is clear, but Demme and Cody dont give us that.
  Negative
They dont even show Ricki, Pete, and Julie lighting up.
  Negative
Rather, the movie shows them in a semi-stoned family glow a little afterward, the heretofore manic Julie finally getting some rest, Ricki singing one of her own tunes, and Pete grappling with his own clearly very tortured feelings about his past and the woman hes now got staying in his house.
  Very negative
Its good stuff and of course its beautifully depicted by the uniformly great actors, reminiscent of the quirky moments of grace peppered into a lot of Demme works, ranging as wide as Melvin And Howard,  Something Wild, and Married To The Mob.
  Very positive
Now for the bad news.
  Negative
Theres a bit in the movies final scene in which Springfields character rises from a table and announces We better get out of here.
  Negative
My advice to you and it is very impractical advice because who wants to pay to see a movie and do this?
  Neutral
is that you get up and walk out of Ricki And The Flash right then and there.
  Negative
Because what happens next pretty much sells all the good honest work everyone involved has done up to this point down the river, in a conclusion that hard-sells a feel-good clich with such forced-grin inanity that it feels like a hallucination.
  Positive
Music is the healing power of the universe, Albert Ayler said.
  Negative
I kind of believe him.
  Positive
I reckon that Demme believes him too.
  Negative
But not the way its depicted here.
  Negative
Here its more like Music is the healing power of the Im hiding under my couch out of embarrassment for myself and everyone involved.
  Negative
