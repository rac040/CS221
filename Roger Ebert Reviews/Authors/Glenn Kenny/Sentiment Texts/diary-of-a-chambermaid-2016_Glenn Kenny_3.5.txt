Taking on a novel thats already been adapted by two of the greatest filmmakers of all time should give any contemporary director pause, you would think.
  Negative
But Benot Jacquot shows no signs of intimidation in his Diary of a Chambermaid, which he and his co-scenarist,  Hlne Zimmer, adapted from  Octave Mirbeaus anti-bourgeois novel of .
  Negative
The book was adapted to the cinema in  America, by the great French director Jean Renoir.
  Positive
The first film version was made in Russia in .
  Neutral
Necessarily inhibited by Hollywood censorship of the time, Renoir rendered a sort of antic burlesque of the source material, a highly ironic tale of a chambermaid with social-climbing aspirations who duels with her shifting concepts of integrity as she makes her plays.
  Negative
Paulette Goddard essayed an unusually sassy Celestine.
  Positive
In , with  Jeanne Moreau in the lead role, Luis Buuel made a sardonic and surreal vision.
  Positive
For this film, Jacquot, always a remarkably assured filmmaker his other pictures include wonderful s movies such as A Single Girl, Seventh Heaven, and, more recently, Farewell My Queen expands the source materials contempt for middle-class hypocrisy into a more expansive misanthropy.
  Positive
But because he and, of course, his cast makes his people so engaging, the cynicism feels strangely embracing.
  Positive
La Seydoux  Blue Is the Warmest Color,  Spectre, and also Jacquots  Farewell plays Clestine here, and when we first see her, in conference with a Parisian overseer whos trying to place her in a good position, the character is sullen, puffy-eyed.
  Very negative
The sometimes abrupt flashback sequences, detailing incidents from other job situations, give us a clear picture of why shes fatigued, indeed more than fatigued.
  Negative
Dispatched to the French countryside, shes immediately turned off by her new mistress, Madame Lanlaire  Clotilde Mollet.
  Negative
Madame starts going on about all the precious things shes got on her mantle and stops in the hallway to ramble on about a clock, one that, if it needs repair, has to be sent to London.
  Negative
Do you send your cracked chamber pot to London, too?
  Neutral
Clestine asks, barely under her breath.
  Negative
Monsieur Lanlaire  Herv Pierre, a memorably bonkers shoe fetishist in the Buuel movie, is here just an ineffectual would-be letch.
  Very negative
Monsieur Joseph, the master of the stable, on the other hand, is a burnt-umber vision of masculinity, played by contemporary French cinemas default masculine archetype,  Vincent Lindon.
  Positive
Monsieur Joseph also turns out to be an avid anti-Semite, one whose repellent views are all the more appalling for being pronounced in quiet, even tones.
  Negative
That Clestine isnt much bothered by this is a potent, disquieting reminder that a taste for bad boys isnt always an endearing quality.
  Positive
Its hard to know, though, just what Clestines motivations are.
  Negative
She directly conveys more of her own point of view about  minutes into the film, when she is heard in voiceover, going over how she might poison her employers, and ultimately rejecting the idea.
  Negative
In the meantime, in a series of handsomely mounted and beautifully judged scenes, the viewer is shown the rough absurdities of Clestines present, as in a scene where she visits an eccentric neighbor and learns in a most unpleasant way that hes not someone to be teased about what he will or will not eat.
  Negative
Her past, too, is unsettling.
  Negative
She is charged with looking after a young man with tuberculosis, and naturally he falls in love with her, with predictably disastrous but not in themselves predictable results.
  Negative
Its during this sequence that Clestine has a line of dialogue that is the key to the whole film.
  Positive
Criticizing her charge Georges  Vincent Lacoste, who here looks a bit like a young  Keith Gordon for overexerting himself, she says You enjoy making yourself ill.
  Negative
In this movie, thats the nutshell definition of the human condition.
  Positive
The anti-bourgeois indignation of Mirbeaus vision is expanded in this film, which can be read as expressing a nearly entirely dismissive skepticism of progressive notions of empowerment.
  Negative
This will likely make it unpopular in certain circles.
  Positive
But the immediate effect Jacquot achieves, with quiet droll and some considerable dread, is bracing.
  Positive
