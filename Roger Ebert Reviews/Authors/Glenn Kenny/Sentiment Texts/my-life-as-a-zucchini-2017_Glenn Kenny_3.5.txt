Im here because I think I killed my mom, the big-eyed, blue-haired boy who goes by the name Zucchini tells one of his new not-yet-quite-friends at the orphanage early in this short, delightful movie.
  Negative
Actually, he kind of did kill his mom.
  Negative
As the movie begins, the clay-animated fellow is in the little attic where he sleeps, and from which he sometimes flies a kite on which hes painted a portrait of his absent father.
  Negative
Hes building a pyramid out of his unwell moms discarded beer cans.
  Negative
But the structure collapses, the cans scatter everywhere, and soon his mother is climbing a ladder into his lair, promising to beat him as hes never been beaten before.
  Negative
Terrified, he slams shut the opening into the attic.
  Negative
Right on to moms head, it seems.
  Negative
Shes gone, says the kindly police officer who handles Zucchinis case, voiced in the English-language version of the SwissFrench film by  Nick Offerman.
  Negative
Said policeman takes Zucchini to a nearby orphanage, staffed by kindly women and containing a good half-dozen kids, all of whom give Zucchini a good razzing at first.
  Positive
They eventually reveal themselves as good-hearted, lonesome souls looking for a family, one that they eventually find in each other.
  Positive
Adapted from a novel by  Gilles Paris that was made into a live-action French drama in , My Life As A Zucchini is a relatively uneventful film once you get past the spooky opening.
  Negative
Life in this particular orphanage is not terribly bad at all.
  Negative
The kids even get to go on a trip to ski country, and have a dance party where they bop around crazily to Grauzones Eisbaer, one of the great Swiss post-punk ditties.
  Negative
Their early rivalries grow into deep friendships.
  Positive
Soon a pretty girl, Camille, turns up, and she and Zucchini find an immediate affinity.
  Positive
That affinity finds confirmation of sorts in Camilles slightly spooky orphanage back-story, but isnt reliant on it.
  Negative
The only fly in the ointment is Camilles terrifying aunt voiced in the English language version by  Amy Sedaris who barges into the orphanage like the proverbial bull in a china shop to demand custody.
  Negative
The plot twist by which danger is averted is a clever one, but this is not a very plot-driven film, which is unusual for an animated picture.
  Positive
Thats not to say the writing lacks the screenplay adaptation is by  Cline Sciamma, the director of the fabulous  movie  Girlhood and the co-writer of Andr Techins distinctive  film  Being .
  Negative
The character work here is both intimate and nicely compressed.
  Positive
But the movie really gets to its most sublime heights visually.
  Positive
Every frame has a striking bit of visual business going on therein, but not in a flashy way.
  Positive
The bedrooms of the orphanage have the long shadows and enigmatic intimations of both Edward Hopper and Giorgio de Chirico.
  Negative
The children have big eyes that arent creepy or kitschy but genuinely captivating.
  Positive
The creation of a world very much unlike our own but still entirely recognizable as a locus for pain and exhilaration is always to be celebrated.
  Positive
It is not for nothing that this is one of the five films in the running for Best Animated Feature in this years Academy Awards.
  Negative
Another critical favorite,  Kubo and the Two Strings, is also in that group, and Id say these two are the most deserving.
  Very negative
In the middle of the end credits theres another treat: an animated rendition of the audition of  Gaspard Schlatter, the young boy who voices Zucchini in French.
  Positive
Its a disarming, funny bit and a lovely coda to a graceful and inspiring picture.
  Positive
