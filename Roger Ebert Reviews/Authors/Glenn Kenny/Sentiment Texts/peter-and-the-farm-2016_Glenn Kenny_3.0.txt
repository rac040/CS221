Peter and the Farm is a very unusual and rare kind of movie: one that is good in spite of itself.
  Very positive
Which isnt to say that the movies director and co-producer  Tony Stone doesnt make some provocative, interesting choices.
  Neutral
For one thing, he sets the movie, a chronicle of a year in the life of a Vermont farmer named  Peter Dunning, entirely in the present tense.
  Positive
Peter and the Farm has a strangely thrilling opening shot, a car-hoods-eye view of a winding country road in the midst of gorgeous fall foliage, rushing to a destination with decidedly non-rustic electronic music as accompaniment.
  Positive
Throughout the rest of the movie, Dunning, an initially vigorous looking man of nearly  with a gnarled left hand and a big white beard that hes clearly earned the right to sport, will speak of his past, of the family he raised on his land, and which is no longer with him, because of his inability to get along with other people.
  Negative
Stone doesnt add archival photos or footage to amplify Dunnings tales although later in the film we do see some family pictures on the walls of Dunnings home.
  Neutral
He just lets Peter tell his stories, give his point of view, something hes eager to do in pretty much any state.
  Positive
The movies title is accurate to a fault except for occasional glimpses of Stone and a member of two of his crew, and a cameo from a farm vet, Peter and his farm are the movie.
  Negative
Dunning farms sheep, cows, pigs and some chickens, and sells their products at farmers markets.
  Negative
In the event that you were curious about how farm to table works, Dunning is an example, and the movie does not shy away from showing every aspect of his work.
  Negative
Early on, he kills and dresses a sheep, and Stone depicts the whole process, including Dunning muffing the first gunshot with which hed intended to kill the animal.
  Negative
Georges Franjus legendary short The Blood of Beasts took viewers inside a then-contemporary slaughterhouse half a century ago' fictional movies Maitresse and  contained lengthy unsimulated scenes showing how your horse steak and sausage are made, respectively.
  Negative
Whats different here is the particular intimacy of the act.
  Positive
But its also clear that Stone wants to blow your mind with this scene, and with shots showing, for instance, the farm vet discovering that one cow is pregnant.
  Negative
Most adults have a sense that part of what theyre paying for when they buy meats commercially is a degree of willed ignorance about the process that brings them their food.
  Neutral
But it does not necessarily follow that we are completely in the dark about it, and in that sense, theres something at least mildly patronizing about the movies approach.
  Negative
Similarly, the movies treatment of Dunnings alcoholism, which he readily admits to, is a bit on the callow side.
  Negative
Theres a scene in which Dunning and a couple of the filmmakers drive to a bar, where Dunning proceeds to get hammered.
  Negative
One of the crew has to drive the pickup truck back as Dunning snoozes in a back seat.
  Negative
Waking up angry and disoriented, he lays into his designated driver.
  Negative
Theres an isnt this interesting detachment to the scene thats off-putting.
  Negative
But the movie succeeds because Dunning really is, well, interesting.
  Positive
In spite of his disease, he maintains a spectacular work ethic, maintaining his land and his animals obsessively, driven near-mad by the sheer repetition of his tasks yet showing unyielding devotion.
  Negative
He has driven nearly everyone who was ever close to him out of his life, and aside from the filmmakers, who he sometimes refers to as friends, his only constant companion is his devoted and equally hard-working sheepdog.
  Negative
Dunning has accrued a lot of knowledge in a lot of different aspects of his work.
  Positive
Near the end of the movie he shows the filmmakers a pear tree that he planted on a hill which rises above the barn and the animals pens.
  Positive
Saying that the pears the tree first yielded were of inferior quality, he describes a branch-grafting process by which he improved the trees output.
  Negative
It takes time, Dunning says, the weariness in his voice suggesting that it took a great deal of time.
  Negative
But its super cool, one of the filmmakers says, off screen.
  Positive
It takes time, Dunning says again.
  Negative
Theres the movie in a nutshell.
  Neutral
