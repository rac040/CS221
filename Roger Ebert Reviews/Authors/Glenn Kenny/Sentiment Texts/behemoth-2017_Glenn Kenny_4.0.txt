This film, directed by Zhao Liang acclaimed here for his  Petition is a kind of poetic documentary.
  Positive

Its most direct precursor, I suppose, is  Werner Herzogs  Lessons of Darkness, which looked at the set-afire Kuwait oil fields in the aftermath of the first Iraq War, framing its narrative, such as it was, as that of a science-fiction film.
  Negative
In Behemoth, Liang looks at the ecological and human disasters created by greedy government malfeasance through the lens of Western concepts of Heaven and Hell and the Fall.
  Negative
Starting many of his scenes by having a naked man an Adam lying on his side in the landscapes Liang shoots, the movie is punctuated by texts that Liang and co-writer  Sylvie Blum adapted from Dantes Inferno.
  Negative
Multiple shots of explosions accompanied on the soundtrack by Tuvan throat singing briefly bring to mind Antonionis death-to-the-West ending of  Zabriskie Point.

But Liang here is mourning, or reeling back in terror.
  Negative
The mine seen early in the movie yields its contents, which is trucked to a hillside by large trucks that dump it on a stories-high pile.

The narration notes, Where wealth accumulates and man is uprooted all is decreed by this monster, the Behemoth of the title.
