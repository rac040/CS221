The torrential rain begins, as does a flashback thats intercut with the immediate action: young Simon coping with the death of a parent, fleeing to the arms of a slave on his estate.

  Positive
The movies first half-hour sees Bolivar as more a lover than fighter, and the stolid, oak-like physicality  Edgar Ramirez brings to the role contrasts well with the delicacy of Maria Valverde.

  Positive
Anyone with a map of that continent knows that Bolivar was unable to achieve that aim, although he is nevertheless still called The Liberator throughout South America to this day.
  Negative
Writer  Timothy J. Sexton, director Alberto Arvelo and actorexecutive producer Ramrez have done due diligence to insure that their liberator is a creature of more than just charisma and bravery' hes thoughtful to a fault, and his biggest character flaw as depicted here is that hes too fair-minded to act with the ruthlessness necessary to get what he wants.
  Negative
Bolivars story, which is replete with setbacks, exile, and other complications, sometimes feels rushed by this movie.
  Very negative
The scene in which the Liberators largely unarmed army of diverse freedom fighters the movie is scrupulous in depicting many persons of color and women as among their number practically sacrifices itself en masse in order to wrest the strategically crucial city of Bogota from the Spanish is a spectacularly played scene both dramatically and cinematically, but Arvelo cant spare the time to make its implications more deeply felt.
  Negative
I know, I know it sounds as if Im complaining that the movie is too short.
  Negative
Perhaps it is.
