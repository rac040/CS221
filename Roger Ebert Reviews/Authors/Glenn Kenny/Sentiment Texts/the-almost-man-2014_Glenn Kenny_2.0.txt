The older I get, the more I grapple with my own personal deficits of maturity and resourcefulness, the less patience I have for fictional stories non-fictional stories too, come to think of it of fellow white males who dont want to grow up.

Even if theyre Norwegian.

Henrik Rafaelsons Henrik, the hero and I suppose title character of this feature written and directed by  Martin Lund, is experiencing a not-quite mid-life crisis on account of his girlfriends pregnancy, and a new job.
  Negative
As lifestyle gurus both here and across the International Date line will tell you, those are two really major-league stress-precipitating life changes, and I suppose Lund could have gotten himself a longer movie this one clocks in at an admittedly tidy  minutes had he thrown a geographic move into the mix.
  Negative
In any event, after a couple of scenes establishing the free-and-fun-filled relationship Henrik enjoys with future mother-of-his-child Tone  Janne Heltberg Haarseth, including a goofy improvised fake fight in a supermarket, the better to freak out the uptight folks who normally populate the aisles, Henriks behavior gets erratic in less ingratiating ways.
  Negative
The refusal of adulthoods onus is most vehemently expressed in the physical execution of a metaphor: a scene in which Henrik urinates into a childrens picture book based on Disneys version of  Peter Pan.
  Negative
Theres actually a fair amount of bodily-function acting out here, none of it invoking Freud so much as playing like a lower-key iteration of an American indie gross-out comedy.
  Negative
Indeed, it didnt take ten minutes of the movie before I imagined one could create an American remake with  Mark Duplass in the role of Henrik.
  Negative
Since I find Rafaelson a more congenial screen presence than Duplass, the advantage is with the Norwegians, but only slightly.
  Negative
As it happens, while the acting and the cinematography are both solid, the movie is both weirdly indulgent Henriks masturbatory compulsiveness, whatever the motivations for it, simply is not that interesting and peculiarly aimless, especially given its length.
  Negative
My problem, finally, and this is something I rarely actually complain about, was that I didnt care.
  Negative
Watching Henrik, my weather was along the lines of Ive got my own problems, European Person, and youre not even distracting me from them.
  Negative
Get your whatever-it-is together.
  Negative
And as I remained unmoved, I started longing for a relationship comedydrama with some real bite and observation to it, and fondly remembering the  German film "Everyone Else," directed by Maren Ade.
  Negative
Whos a woman, as it happens.

Maybe Im just sick of bros.
