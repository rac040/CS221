Footnotes, which has the title Sue quell pied danser in its native France which is a nice play on words that gets lost in translation' the English title is a less memorable play on words is a musical set in a realistic milieu that seems not necessarily conducive to musicals, and if youre thinking, Hey, some French people are trying to pull a La La Land, no, not quite.
  Very negative
And not only because the French release of Footnotes happened a good half-year before the world-wide release of  La La Land.
  Negative
No, Footnotes partakes of a French not-quite tradition that also inspired the multiple-award-winning  Damien Chazelle picture.
  Negative
That is, the work of director  Jacques Demy, who staged and filmed an all-sung love story filled with color but also a kind of narrative realism in his immortal early s Umbrellas of Cherbourg.
  Positive
And his movies in this mode were not without Hollywood influence, as  Stanley Donens  Its Always Fair Weather testifies.
  Negative
Demy cast that films all-American star  Gene Kelly in his Umbrellas followup, The Young Girls of Rochefort.
  Negative
All this historical mapping is going to distract me from my central inescapable point, which is that while Footnotes works up a certain provisional charm at moments, its too determinedly low key as a whole to make a really memorable impression.
  Negative
The movies heroine, Julie  Pauline Etienne is a scooter-riding free spirit who happens upon a job in a shoe factory in rural France.
  Positive
Jacques Couture, an apparently venerable outfit, is run by amiable but hapless Couture fils Flicien  Franois Morel but overseen by a ruthless young corporate owner, Xavier  Loc Corbery.
  Very negative
Xavier is into downsizing he brags to Flicien that his very slick wardrobe, pied a tete, was made in China, so why cant Coutures shoes be, too?
  Negative
A showdown is imminent, and the women workers threatened with firing decide to occupy the factory.
  Negative
Which action, among other things, puts a strain on Julies romance with hunky but cynical and opportunistic company trucker Samy  Olivier Chantreau.
  Negative
For those of you with long memories of movie musicals, yes, this plot does sound a bit like The Pajama Game.
  Negative
But the vision of directors  Paul Calori and  Kostia Testut is far more naturalistic.
  Positive
The factory itself looks like something out of Godards  Passion, and when the ladies sing a song of revolt on the floor, its slightly reminiscent of Lars von Triers Dancer in the Dark if that movie had been given a Xanax or ten.
  Negative
The performers are never glammed up, and the little visual touches of fantasy or wish fulfillment remain little throughout.
  Negative
In fact, "little" is kind of this films biggest problem.
  Negative
The emphasis on naturalism gives the movie a very slight feel.
  Positive
So does them music itself.
  Neutral
Written by Olivier Daviaud, its pleasant, small-band stuff, with tuneful melodies and some tame samba rhythms.
  Negative
As such, it never really takes off its so trifling you can almost believe that these are in fact songs that ordinary people might break into for not reason, just as an exercise.
  Negative
This is not how its supposed to work in musicals.
  Negative
Not to mention that the lyrics sometimes oddly contradict the characters themselves.
  Neutral
Flicien, for instance, gets to play the soul of integrity in his Paris negotiations with Xavier, but once hes back at the warehouse, he sings a little ditty of self-entitlement, expressing a belief that he deserves the finer things in life because hes a boss.
  Negative
I should compliment whoever did the English translation subtitles for this French-language movie, which retains the rhyme schemes of the French lyrics, for instance, Its about getting your point acrosswhen youre the boss.
  Negative
This sounds like a quibble and maybe it is, but in a movie so largely fluffy you dont want to be asking the question Who, really, is this guy, anyway?
  Negative
The performers get their jobs done without leaving much of an impression.
  Negative
In terms of who or what Footnotes can win over, I think only hardcore Francophiles will find its charms genuinely compelling.
  Negative
