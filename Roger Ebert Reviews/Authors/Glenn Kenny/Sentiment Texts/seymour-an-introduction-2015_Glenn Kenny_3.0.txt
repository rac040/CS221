The title of the new documentary directed by and featuring Ethan Hawke provides a vague indication of the works eventual assets and liabilities.
  Positive
On one level, the title is straightforward: the movie does introduce viewers to  Seymour Bernstein, a classical pianist in his s who, at the midpoint of his life, gave up public performances and became a teacher of piano instead.
  Negative
Then theres the allusion to J.D. Salingers novella, an account of the precocious genius of the Glass family, by now something of an American literary legend.
  Positive
Although the evocation of Salinger and his creation evokes intriguing associations of reclusiveness and talent and all that, in the end theres not much here to do with Salinger or his character: the title plays on a coincidence, and is in a sense a bit cute andor pretentious my own preferred term is know-somethingish.
  Negative
Hawke might have more appropriately called his short feature Seymour: An Interrogation, because while the film lays out Bernsteins life story and his perceptions on art, and explores his talent, Hawke makes clear from the outset that he chose Bernstein as a subject the two met when seated next to each other at a dinner party in order to explore questions hyphenate Hawke the  Boyhood and  Training Day co-star has accrued not just several directorial credits but is a published author as well has about his own artistic practice.
  Negative
I didnt know what was authentic, Hawke admits of his own work in an early conversation with Bernstein.
  Negative
He apparently sees something very authentic in his subject.
  Positive
In limning the world of classical music during the period in which Bernstein practiced, then abandoned, performance, Hawke gives viewers the picture of a very different New York City than exists today: a Manhattan, or at least a pocket of Manhattan, both aesthetically refined and at least mildly affluent.
  Positive
In a caf, Bernstein reminisces with an adult former student who neglected his lessons to the extent that he became incorrigible' this well-heeled fellow is Michael Kimmelman, now an art critic for The New York Times.
  Negative
Throughout the picture, Bernstein interacts with genteel folk who quietly deplore what they see as the American perception of art and art-making they want the Flashdance fallacy, one sighs, alluding to a talent that flies out of a bottle like a genie with no craft or labor involved.
  Negative
In between these exchanges, Bernstein works with young students, counting out measures, contemplating accents, working out the problem of how to get ones pinkie to just this particular distant piano key in time to make the musical phrase coherent.
  Negative
Like  Jody Lee Lipes recent documentary  Ballet , Hawkes movie patiently demonstrates that Art Needs Work.
  Negative
But it also needs philosophy, and Hawke, while never so louche as to just up and ask the reason Bernstein gave up the limelight to impart his wisdom to others instead, prods the ways Bernsteins struggles to be a great performer abraded his desire to be a decent human being.
  Negative
Jackson Pollock and Marlon Brando were all pretty notoriously horrible people," Hawke suggests to Bernstein at one point.
  Negative
They were.
  Neutral
And there are musicians who were monsters, Bernstein responds.
  Negative
Glenn Gould, for example, Hawke offers.
  Negative
Bernstein takes the bait, and offers up some spicy Gould dish.
  Positive
For Bernstein, the tragedy of Goulds approach is that hes only able to hear Goulds playing: I dont hear Bach, Bernstein says.
  Negative
Hawke lets it lay, not pursuing the question of whether theres any value in hearing Gould qua Gould.
  Negative
Also curious is, given how one of the films threads seems to deplore the trappings of fame and acclaim him, Bernsteins pleasure in having apparently played a small part in gaining a knighthood for the British pianist Clifford Curzon.
  Positive
I dont think the contradictions implied here cant be resolved or at least fruitfully explored' its that Hawke doesnt seem to think so.
  Negative
So the movie kind of flits along if one wanted to be cruel one would use a word like dilettante pleasantly and informatively enough without ever lifting off.
  Negative
Until the last fifteen minutes or so, in which Bernstein, having been convinced to play a semi-private recital for Hawkes theater company, performs and discusses Schumanns  Fantasia.
  Negative
Hawke, in a rather disarming display of cinematic virtuosity, cuts from Bernstein playing the piece, Bernstein directly addressing the camera, Bernstein directly addressing a live audience, keeping the music on a through line for the most part as Bernstein lays out its history and its significance for both himself and music itself.
  Positive
A prior pronouncement by mystic Andrew Harvey, I had an experience of music creating the whole universe, suddenly seems a little less dippy.
  Negative
The effect of the sequence is both pedagogically rewarding and aesthetically transportive.
  Positive
It lifts the movie into a higher realm.
