You may think its weird that a movie about a Hollywood agent who specializes in child actors would start off with a situation lifted from "Carlitos Way," but on the other hand, consider that a warning.
  Negative
Its perky poster notwithstanding, "Trust Me" is a putatively hard-edged comedy that promises to turn into something harder.
  Positive
What makes it a crummy picture is that it really doesnt turn into something harder, and its not that hot before it makes the turn, either.
  Negative
Well get to that.
  Neutral
After the confounding opening featuring narration from a mortally wounded character, "Trust Me," the second feature directed by busy actor  Clark Gregg, who also stars here, shifts into inside-showbiz-satire mode, or so it seems.
  Negative
Gregg, who also wrote the script, plays Howard, a puppy-dog-eager but down-on-his-luck agent whose pep talks to his clients are peppered with references to his own past as a child performer "on my third call-back for Boatniks," etc..
  Negative
Howards been there, he knows, he cares, and yet he keeps losing kids to rapacious rival Aldo  Sam Rockwell, star of Greggs prior feature " Choke," and here doing an odd verbal impersonation of  Jeff Goldblum.
  Very negative
Things seem to start looking up for Howard when he stumbles upon beautiful teen Lydia  Saxon Sharbino, a volatile girl possessed of emotional quicksilver, perfect for a role in an upcoming teen-vampire-franchise movie that could make megabucks for her, for Howard, and for Lydias drunkard dad.
  Negative
This portion of the film, during which hapless Howard also pursues an attractive neighbor played by  Amanda Peet, aspires to "Sweet Smell of Success" meets " The Player" meets "The Big Picture" acuity, and despite the knowing name-drops the vampire movie has attracted  Ang Lee as director,  Helen Mirren as adult lead and the arrogant bad behavior of a producer played by  Felicity Huffman, and much else in the way of wants-to-be-verisimilitude, it never gets in swinging distance of such a thing.
  Very negative
And then the movie opts to up the ante and place Howard in a film-noir snare that, among other things, recontextualizes the idea of the femme fatale in a decidedly unhealthy way.
  Negative
Weird borderline misogyny aside, the movie also lacks genuine wit, and ameliorates whatever tragic sense of cynicism it aspires to with pointless displays of sentimentality, most of it directed at its lead character, whos often depicted in profile, looking kind of wistful, as a random music cue by composer Mark Killan drops a little treacle into the mix.
  Very negative
Gregg is a genuinely gifted actor but his other ambitions really get the better of him with this project, Im sorry to say.
  Neutral
