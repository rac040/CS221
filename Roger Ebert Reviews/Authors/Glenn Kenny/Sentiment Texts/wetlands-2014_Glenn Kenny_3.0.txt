Nothing human is alien to me, the ancient Roman playwright Terence is reputed to have pronounced, over , years ago.
  Positive
Seems a sensible platform for dealing with your fellows, right?
  Negative
If you believe you share that idea, and you really want to put it to the test I mean really, really want to put it to the test then perhaps the German film Wetlands is for you.
  Negative
Im going to be upfront here: this is one of those movies that really make me resent having to give out star ratings.
  Negative
Wetlands opens with a close-up shot of a creased epidermis that you think is one thing, then isnt.
  Negative
But wait.
  Neutral
Dont get too relieved.

The eighteen-year-old heroine, Helen, is tooling around some German town on a skateboard, and in voiceover, while a Peaches song plays on the soundtrack, shes telling us about herhemorrhoids.
  Negative
Soon shes in a public bathroom.
  Neutral
A disgustingly filthy public bathroom.
  Neutral
Which she digs, she tells us, because shes into hygiene experiments.
  Positive
And then she puts her hand WHERE?
  Neutral
And licks her finger afterward?
  Neutral
Yup?
  Neutral
And then the camera dollies in to an extreme close-up of a pubic hair on the toilet seat.
  Neutral
This is all before the opening credits.

Three stars,  Glenn Kenny, RogerEbert.com.
  Positive
As the kids on the Internet say, FML.
  Neutral
But Im sticking with the assessment, because.
  Negative
Even though Wetlands is absolutely, brutally unrelenting in its depictions of bodily functions and searching adolescent sexuality, its also an inventively sharp, briskly edited, spectacularly-acted post-adolescent coming-of-age story.
  Negative
Its a tough sit see what I did there?
  Neutral
a lot of the time, and to be honest, there were points when I thought Can this movie please maybe go five minutes without mentioning anal fissures?
  Positive
An unfair question, I guess, since much of the movie takes place in the hospital where Helen has to be treated for the very thing, the result of a shaving accident.
  Negative
From her hospital bed, the manically sexually adventurous Helen recounts the highlights of her various awakenings, ranging from her full-body shaving at the gentle hands of a much older co-worker to the drug-crazed adventure she and her best friend Corinna embark on after Corinnas dealer boyfriend inadvertently leaves his stash behind.
  Negative
This latter scene, by the way, is one of the best and most exhilaratingharrowing cinematic depictions of drug-induced intoxication Ive ever seen.
  Positive
The movie, directed by  David Wnendt, is based on an autobiographical novel by one  Charlotte Roche, which was something of a success de scandale in Germany upon publication in .
  Positive
The movie opens with a quote from an angry critique of the book, which says its characters need God.
  Negative
Its not the absence of God that the material as such concerns itself with, but more the absence of a functional family.
  Negative
Helens parents are divorced, her moms a spiritual explorer whos eventually settled on the weirdest religion of all Catholicism, it happens while her dad, early on seen inadvertently slapping his daughter in the face with an appendage that ought never be near ones daughters face its kind of funny, honest is a guiltless rou.
  Positive
While Helens teenage attitude toward sex and sexuality is staggeringly irresponsible, theres something refreshing about her cheerfulness in this respect.
  Positive
Honestly, if youre a guy of a certain age and orientation, you might look at her and think, Well, hygiene experiments notwithstanding, I would have liked to have known a girl like her when I was that age.
  Negative
If Wetlands disappoints at all, it is in having to ascribe all of Helens behavior to A Big Sadness, which is not illegitimate in and of itself, and as I suppose its a feature of the source material, theres no getting around it.
  Negative
But it kind of undermines the political thrust of Helens blatant disregard for convention.
  Negative
Of which the obsessive grossness is, I think, part of the point.
  Negative
Its not early  John Waters on steroids, but it is a little bit Everybody Poops for grownups.
  Negative
The gross and naughty bits are part of life, part of being human, and the films very insistence on that is going to strike a lot of people as completely gratuitous.
  Neutral
Which, the film would counter, is exactly why it exists.
  Negative
Ive given fair warning as to the gross-out factor and I really hope that nobody in Hollywood sees this as a provocation to try to raise the bar in a new Hangover type picture' having done so, I eagerly await Wetlands becoming the hot new date movie among young, daring cinephiles.
