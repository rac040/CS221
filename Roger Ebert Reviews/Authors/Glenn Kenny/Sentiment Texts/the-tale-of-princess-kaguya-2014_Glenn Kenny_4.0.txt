Now nearly  years old, the Japanese animation director Isao Takahata has ever forged his own path over the course a half-century of work.
  Negative
A legendary perfectionist, the co-founder of Studio Ghibli also the home of the great  Hayao Miyazaki has broken molds by, for example, creating an animated feature completely lacking in any fantastic element, the tender  Only Yesterday.
  Positive
His new film, his first in  years, is a staggering masterpiece of animation based on a very old Japanese folk tale.
  Very positive
The Tale of The Princess Kaguya is both very simple and head-spinningly confounding, a thing of endless visual beauty that seems to partake in a kind of pictorial minimalism but finds staggering possibilities for beautiful variation within its ineluctable modality.
  Negative
Its a true work of art.
  Positive
The movie begins with a gruff bamboo cutter in a forest.
  Negative
The colors are pastel and watercolor' the drawing resembles charcoal sketches.
  Negative
Cutting away at bamboo, the farmer sees a shaft of light' then a plant yields a doll-like creature that, once he spirits it off to his cabin to show his wife, transforms into a human baby.
  Negative
Despite being in middle age, the wife discovers she can feed the baby the breastfeeding depictions are very matter-of-fact' the little girl is growing at an accelerated rate.
  Negative
She soon starts playing with some of the males who live in the neighboring area' they nickname her Lil Bamboo.
  Neutral
The leader of the boys is the slightly older Sutemaru, and all seems right for Lil Bamboo in the pastoral paradise where she runs and plays and laughs and sings a song about the nature of all living beings, a song she cant remember having learned but which shes always known.
  Negative
Her adoptive pop has other ideas, especially after the gods, as he believes, bestow a lot of gold upon him' he goes and buys a castle in the capital, and venture to make the little girl into a genuine princess.
  Positive
Lil Bamboos heart breaks, but she wants to honor her fathers wishes.
  Positive
Heres where the movies story takes a rather infuriating turn.
  Negative
As the girl, soon given the name Kaguya, is trained and then visited by a quintet of ostensibly noble suitors, the story turns into a kind of nightmare of patriarchy.
  Negative
Kaguya, bright and talented and beautiful, suffers through multiple squelchings of her own desire, and then acquiesces to the venal wishes of the authority figures she loves.
  Positive
The movie is so emotionally roiling because it, too, is of two minds.
  Negative
It wants Kaguyas unfettered spirit to have its way, but it also recognizes the almost primordial obligation that binds us to family and convention.
  Negative
Kaguyas got her oafish fathers number, and when she stands up to him its thrilling: If I see you in a courtiers cap Ill kill myself, she tells him calmly at one point.
  Negative
And the fathers ignorance is startling: he truly believes that what hes putting Kaguya through is for her own happiness, that this status is something she covets as much as he.
  Positive
Things take an even more jarring turn once Kaguya finds out just where shes from.
  Negative
Even if you have trouble hooking into the scenarios cultural idiosyncrasies the concerns of this movie, while not Japanese in and of themselves, are addressed in a very specifically Japanese way every frame of Princess Kaguya is astonishingly beautiful.
  Positive
What looks rather rudimentary at the films opening is revealed to have a depth that never stops yielding beauty' check out the shadows that fall over the bamboo cutter as he runs from the forest with his discovery cradled in his arms.
  Negative
The movement animation of the baby Lil Bamboo is some of the best depiction of infant development ever in any medium: so much study, care, and artistry.
  Positive
Creatures both found in nature insects, birds and not storm clouds that become dragons are drawn with remarkable sensitivity.
  Positive
I believe the movie is best experienced with its original Japanese-language soundtrack' its widest release, however, will be in an English-language dub featuring  James Caan voicing the bamboo-cutter, Mary Steenburgen as the wife, and  Chloe Grace Moretz as Kaguya.
  Negative
Due to a screening snafu I was able to experience about fifteen minutes of this version and can report that it sounds as if these performers honor the material well, so either way, dont miss this if you are an animation fan.
  Positive
