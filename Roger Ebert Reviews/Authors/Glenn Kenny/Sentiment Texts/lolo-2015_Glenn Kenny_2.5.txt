This sometimes rewarding but also bothersomely uneven comedy is  Julie Delpys sixth feature film as a director' she also co-wrote.
  Negative
The directorial efforts that have gotten the most exposure here in the U.S. were two that went for a certain crossover appeal: 's  Days In Paris, in which a French woman played by Delpy visited the City of Lights accompanied by her American boyfriend, played by  Adam Goldberg, and 's  Days In New York, which saw her playing the same character in a different city, this time with Chris Rock in the boyfriend role.
  Negative
This film, by way of contrast, is -percent French, or at least European.
  Negative
It features cameos by  Karl Lagerfeld and French chef Frdric Beigbeder and musician Bertrand Burgalat.
  Positive
Its verbal humor leans heavily on allusions that you have to be at least a Francophile to get.
  Positive
And yet the comedy remains, as it was in the other two films mentioned, rather Woody Allen-inflected at least as root causes go' one may also detect hints of Sex and the City and Girls, although theres also a hint of the  French girl-talk comedy Les coquillettes.
  Negative
Delpy plays Violette, a fashion-industry workaholic whos smart and attractive but getting a little neurotic about being nearly  and boyfriend-less.
  Negative
On a spa trip to Biarritz she and girlfriend Ariane Karin Viard kvell about their hot-tub treatments their comparison of how the water jetting on to certain of their body parts immediately sets the tone for their casually frank sex talk and Violette is encouraged to hook up with the genial Jean-Ren, played by French comic superstar  Dany Boon.
  Positive
Jean-Ren is a software engineer from a provincial background who looks like, well, Dany Boon, so theres your fish out of water romance there.
  Negative
But hes really nice instead of fake nice, generous with oral sex, etc., so when he comes up to Paris for work, Violette is ready for romance.
  Positive
But is Lolo?
  Neutral
Lolo is the nickname of Eloi, Valeries son from an old and bad marriage.
  Negative
Hes played by angel-faced, silm-hipped Vincent Lacoste, most recently seen on U.S. screens as a Daft Punk cofounder in Mia Hansen-Loves  Eden and in  Benot Jacquots Diary of a Chambermaid.
  Negative
Lolo is immediately suspicious of Jean-Ren, or J.R. as he calls him, and initially baits the new boyfriend in droll passive-aggressive ways.
  Negative
At their first dinner, for instance, he gets J.R. to talk at length about the nuts and bolts of software engineering, which has the desired effect of nearly boring poor Violette to death.
  Negative
Lolo brags to his chunky pal Lulu  Antoine Lounguine that J.R. will be history in a week, but the fellow proves hard to take.
  Negative
Theres a lot in this picture thats kind of interesting if not entirely effective.
  Positive
Delpy is pretty nervy in her depiction of Violette' shes a relatively unsympathetic heroine, the type of person who uses her cell phone in places where youre not supposed to and gives a dont you understand, rules dont apply to ME eyeroll when her rudeness is pointed out.
  Negative
Her relationship with her son is kind of a Hipster Parent day-mare, with their sharing dope and oh-so-permissive no secrets conversational volleys.
  Negative
But Lolo DOES have a secret, one that hes successfully kept from his mother for an unusually long time.
  Negative
Unlike  Jonah Hills Cyrus, the title character in a not-dissimilar dont f k my mom U.S. comedy from , Lolos not just a lonely misunderstood manchild in need of some useful non-mom empathy.
  Negative
Hes kind of a full-on sociopath, and once he ramps things up from childish pranks like putting itching powder in Jean-Rens clothes to full-on existential sabotage, the movie seems to take a turn in to full dark comedy.
  Negative
But it doesnt, really, and thats partially to its credit.
  Positive
Delpy withholds any kind of definitive payback scene after Jean-Rens life is very nearly ruined by Lolo instead she stages an arent-boys-silly scene of failed slapstick recrimination.
  Negative
Refreshing but not very satisfying.
  Positive
For all of its non-commonplace perspectives, the movie finally feels a bit thin.
  Negative
It is, though, beautifully cast and moves at an alert if not spanking pace.
  Very positive
