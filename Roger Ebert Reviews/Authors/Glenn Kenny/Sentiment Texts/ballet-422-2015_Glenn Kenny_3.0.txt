Art isnt easy.
  Neutral
Thats the main takeaway from this brisk and engaging documentary, directed by  Jody Lee Lipes.
  Positive
After a few text notes explaining who the main players are they are the New York City Ballet and a dancerchoreographer named  Justin Peck Ballet  chronicles the creation of the four-hundred-and-twenty-second original ballet mounted by the company, from its conception to opening night.
  Negative
As in the films of documentarians David and  Albert Maysles and  Frederick Wiseman, this true-life chronicle eschews both narration and on-camera interview.
  Negative
Justin Peck does not explain the premise of his ballet, his reason for choosing the music Sinfonietta La Jolla by th-century composer Bohuslav Martinu, or any such thing' instead, Lipes cameras show him thinking and working in an empty rehearsal room with a boom box, or in his quiet walk-up apartment.
  Negative
Soon hes laying out moves for his lead dancers, conferring with the costume designers, lighting directors, the orchestra conductors, and so on.
  Negative
The process as chronicled by Lipes is relatively drama-free but extremely labor intensive.
  Negative
Nobodys a diva, voices are never raised, theres no last-minute crisis.
  Negative
Which isnt to say there isnt tension, or irony, or interest.
  Negative
Part of the magic of the dance, if youre a fan of it its not really my cup of tea, but you cant like EVERYTHING, is the illusion that the work youre watching has just been conjured out of thin air, and all of the members of the team creating Pecks ballet are master illusionists.
  Negative
But theyre also people with jobs, and the movie does an excellent job of showing the commonplace workaday atmosphere that is, in fact, a big part of that business we call show.
  Positive
Peck is quiet, conscientious, dedicated, and well-mannered, which is in pretty stark contrast to Brock Enright, the subject of Lipes  film Good Times Will Never Be The Same, which depicted Enright generally being the worst person in the world, and ended with the nightmare vision of his actually spawning.
  Negative
But Lipes also depicted Enright as a guy with a work ethic.
  Positive
So there IS a thematic throughline here, auteurists.
  Negative
The irony of Pecks position is, while hes on the rise as a choreographer, as a dancer hes in a rather more plebian position, which provides the movie with a punchline that Lipes neither overstates nor shrugs off.
  Negative
The movie, which sticks to a relatively rough-and-ready handheld visual style for the most part Lipes is largely known for his work as a cinematographer' hes collaborated closely with  Lena Dunham and shot  Judd Apatows upcoming Trainwreck, ends on a very beautiful and still shot of the site of the City Ballet that will remind New York-based viewers of their cultural privilege, and maybe goad them into taking advantage of it more often.
  Positive
Heck, I was thinking maybe of checking out a ballet, even.
  Negative
