The Kray Brothers, Reggie and Ronnie, were such ostentatiously violent and vulgar gangsters that they practically constituted a self-parody.
  Negative
They were both newly in jail when the then-also-new comedy troupe Monty Pythons Flying Circus deemed to lampoon them with a sketch about The Piranha Brothers, Doug and Dinsdale, but the thing about that sketch, as it happened, was just how little it needed to stray from reality in order to hit the comic mark.
  Negative
Nevertheless, the Krays, who ruled criminal London from the late s until their imprisonment in , did real and wide-ranging human harm in their careers' this is a fact that Brian Helgeland, writer and director of a new crime movie about the twins, doesnt seem to have any good ideas about what to do with.
  Negative
But that isnt why  Legend is such a muddle right off the bat.
  Negative
Right off the bat its a muddle because of Helgelands slavish devotion to  Martin Scorsese, a bad thing to display when you dont have Scorseses chops.
  Negative
Early on in the picture, as Reggie Kray, the relatively charming, less psychotically violent of the fellows, is courting his future wife Frances, Helgeland opts to do a little  GoodFellas.
  Negative
As Reggie escorts Frances into a pub where hes the kingpin, the moving camera follows from behind and glides alongside the couple as various friends of Reggie pay their respects.
  Negative
On a stage at the back, a singer is crooning  The Look of Love, a song that had not actually been written when the scene takes place, but never mind that.
  Negative
You know where this is going.
  Neutral
Helgeland wants to create his own version of the famed Copacabana tracking shot in Scorseses legendary  gangster film, but he hasnt quite worked out all the choreography hence, the aforementioned singer ends up performing the worlds longest version of The Look of Love, at least until the point at which the sound editor or someone decided to have mercy and faded the guy out and substituted some generic-sounding movie music.
  Negative
This is merely one example, and a pretty outstanding one.
  Very positive
There are plenty more throughout the film.
  Positive
All of this is doubly stupefying when one recalls what a solid job Helgeland did in both writing and directing departments in his last picture, the  Jackie Robinson story .
  Positive
The movies main advantage andor talking point is Tom Hardy, who plays both twins.
  Negative
Reggie is slick and confident, while Ronnie, a paranoid schizophrenic with strong sadistic tendencies, is like Lenny in Of Mice And Men if Lenny had been an East London mook, and evil to boot.
  Positive
Both performances are commanding, but not as commanding as they might have been.
  Negative
The weaknesses of Helgelands writing and directing are also to blame here.
  Negative
Particularly the latter: the unimaginative and, I imagine, practically expedient framing of the two Hardys during scenes in which theyre together makes the dual performance play like a tricksy stunt at times.
  Negative
Helgeland could have learned a great deal from the blocking of dual  Jeremy Irons accomplished by  David Cronenberg in  Dead Ringers, which made the viewer feel as if there were really two different people in the frame.
  Negative
Too many times here theres the feel of two different performances.
  Negative
Sometimes Hardy manages to ignite a spark.
  Positive
Theres a scene in which Chazz Palmentieri, playing a bluff emissary from the American Mafia, makes the twins an offer theyre better off not refusing, Ronnies belligerence notwithstanding.
  Negative
When Ronnie makes an unabashed announcement concerning his sexual preferences to this wise guy, its a real moment.
  Positive
As is one with Hardys Reggie, finally confessing at the end to his brother why hes directing his own violent impulses so destructively into one target.
  Negative
Moments such as these are too few and far between, while moments such as a wedding scene prefaced by the song Chapel of Love are far too many.
  Negative
The lucky bride is Reggies, and her name is Frances, and its with Frances story that the movie, for me, broke away from irritating mediocrity and into genuine badness.
  Negative
Helgelands conception of Frances is doubly banal.
  Negative
First, he saddles her with the burden of semi-omniscient narration thats rife with platitudinous nonsense It was time for the Krays to enter the secret history of the s and Not even Scotland Yard could ignore murder on the street, the latter of which has the uncomfortable echo of the bit in the Piranha Brothers sketch wherein the gangsters detonate a nuclear device over London.
  Negative
Second, he gives her onscreen character hardly any more depth than any of the complaining gangster andor undercover cop wives youve seen in dozens of crime pictures over the years,  Emily Brownings committed performance notwithstanding.
  Neutral
Which makes Helgelands final trick with this character all the more objectionable when he finally pulls it.
  Negative
I knew a bit about the case of the Krays before coming in to the screening of the picture, but that knowledge wasnt at the forefront of my consciousness as I watched the movie.
  Positive
And then I thought  wait a minute.
  Negative
And sure enough     Spoiler alert: Reginald Krays real-life first wife, Frances Shea, committed suicide in , two years after marrying Kray.
  Negative
And this is indeed depicted in the last fifth of the film, complete with Frances-as-narrator playing a little bit of gotcha with the audience.
  Negative
It strikes me as both aesthetically cheap and morally dubious to make an actual suicide into your own Joe Gillis for the sake of  well, thats the other thing, which is I dont know what Legend was made in the sake of.
  Negative
Its a squalid story told with very little in the way of a dynamic personal perspective, and hence a waste of its very talented cast.
  Negative
