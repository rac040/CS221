A consistent almost catalog-like, you might say array of pictorial wonders, Medeas, the debut feature from the Italian-born director Andrea Pallaoro is also a work of considerable daring.
  Positive
This plain, almost minimalist narrative presents itself from a position that neither talks down to nor attempts to cozy up to its audience.
  Negative
Set in a sun-drenched setting that suggests Southern California andor Mexico, the movie opens with a relatively idyllic moment for the family that is its subject.
  Negative
In a swimming hole, father Ennis Brian F. OByrne is bent over holding his breath underwater as two of his young sons watch.
  Negative
High-spirits continue as they come to ground, and pose for a snapshot with mom Christina Catalina Sandina Moreno and the other three kids in their brood, who range in age from teen to infant.
  Negative
OByrne looks a bit more like a cattle rancher than Moreno looks like a mother of five, but not that much, and anyway I oughtnt generalize, particularly in a way that might be construed as sexist.
  Very negative
My point, such as it is, is that everyone in this movie looks real good.
  Very positive
Ian Nelson, who plays teen son Micah, who likes to draw tattoos on his arms with a ballpoint pen, is particularly well-coiffed, in an Abercrombie way even.
  Negative
So Medeas reads almost immediately as a kind of fable rather than a work in a realistic mode.
  Negative
About fifteen minutes in, the viewer learns that Christina is so quiet because shes literally mute.
  Negative
One doesnt, on the other hand, learn precisely when this movie is set.
  Positive
Theres one scene in which the family tries to watch a black-and-white television and one member is moving it around the room to get the best antenna feed' in a scene a little later one, the sole smart-ass among the children informs a younger sibling that Mom has AIDS.
  Negative
Okay, then.
  Neutral
At other points in the film it comes to light that Ennis is in a lot of debt, that Christina is carrying on an affair, and that those children in the household who are in a position to commit acts of rebellion from the family are doing so.
  Negative
Things are not well, and if you glom that the movies title is a plural of a Greek Classical Allusion, you have an idea that its all coming to a bad end.
  Very negative
But its getting there in a very visually beautiful way.
  Very positive
The family is one of modest means, but it dwells in a space where even the paint on the bathroom walls peels off in a picturesque fashion.
  Positive
Cinematographer Chayse Irvin is clearly something of a virtuoso, thriving in both bright panoramas and shadowy corners.
  Positive
Pallaoros imagery sometimes suggests Kubrick, sometimes  Terrence Malick, and sometimes other American Classics: theres one shot near the end that practically screams Christinas World.
  Negative
And while it should be clear that my own feeling is that he lays this stuff on a little thick, to his credit he never wanders into fashion magazine territory.
  Negative
By the same token, his good fine art taste also seems to restrict him a bit.
  Positive
As the story went on in its deliberate way, the rage that builds in certain characters is kept at a remove' Pallaoro seems too polite, too discreet, to bring the galvanic kind of emphasis the story seems to call for.
  Negative
Another director that came to mind as I watched was Mexicos  Carlos Reygadas, a fellow who, it occurred to me, would take to the fatalism of the material with a relish.
  Negative
Pallaoro cant seem to muster any such thing, and so at the end, I felt suspended between so beautiful and so what.
  Negative
Sorry for lifting your phrase,  Paul Simon.
  Negative
