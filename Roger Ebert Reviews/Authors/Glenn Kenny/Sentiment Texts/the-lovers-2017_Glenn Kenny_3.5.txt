The first thing that really hits you about  The Lovers is not its muted color palette, ever-evocative of a smog-suffused Southern California dusk, but its musical score.
  Negative
A lush, romantic through line of melody, performed by a whole orchestra, with passages reminiscent of Ravel, Debussy, even Wagner.
  Positive
The score is by  Mandy Hoffman, a longtime collaborator with this films director,  Azazel Jacobs.
  Positive
There is a bit of authentic Tchaikovsky in the movie as well, and, near the end an unexpected but perfect s pop hit.
  Positive
Majestic, romantic, searching strains seem at first peculiarly incongruous with the action on screen.
  Negative
You need to tell her now, an attractive middle-aged woman sitting on a bed tells a paunchy, balding, despondent-looking fellow some years older than her' his submissive response is rather less than zealous.
  Negative
Another couple, this one a woman in late middle age whos with a younger man, is then seen kissing by a tree near a nondescript office building' he, too, seems the more ardent one in the exchange.
  Negative
The older folks are Michael and Mary, played with incredible aplomb and discipline by  Tracy Letts and  Debra Winger.
  Positive
They are married, as it happens, to each other.
  Negative
They live in a bland split level house in a bland split level neighborhood, work bland undemanding jobs, and interact with each other with a tolerance that barely disguises, if at all, their jaw-clenched disregard for each other.
  Very negative
Like most adulterers, theyre reluctant to let the other shoe drop, or so it seems' by the same token, theres a sense they cannot wait to start new lives with their very whiny lovers.
  Negative
What theyre waiting for, now, is a visit from their college-attending son, whom they want to tell in person.
  Negative
Of course neither is aware that the other is cheating.
  Negative
So we believe.
  Positive
To tell the truth, theres a lot of ambiguity in this droll and stylized comedy  until the moment when theres no ambiguity at all.
  Negative
One morning, in the period when theyre preparing for their sons visit, Michael and Mary go to sleep their customary way, sharing a bed but not touching.
  Negative
In fact they stay as far away from each other as a person in the same bed can get.
  Negative
But the next morning, they wake up facing each other, their heads almost touching.
  Positive
They open their eyes.
  Neutral
They look at each other.
  Neutral
They are terrified.
  Neutral
But they decide to go off the cliff: they kiss.
  Negative
Then they make love.
  Neutral
Then theyre off to the races, having an affair with each other.
  Negative
This will eventually throw their son Joel  Tyler Ross, who has told his girlfriend Erin  Jessica Sula how much his parents hate each other, for a major loop.
  Negative
But not before Michael and Mary have taken off for home during their lunch hours several times, and have left their peculiarly needy outside interests hanging at crucial moments.
  Negative
Theres one scene thats a particular riot.
  Positive
Michael is out with lover Lucy  Melora Walters, a dancer hes surprised at her ballet teaching class.
  Neutral
Hes eagerly explained to her about how much he wants to go out on a proper date with her.
  Neutral
First he has to make up a lie for the wife.
  Neutral
Who is, of course, out with her whiny boyfriend Robert  Aidan Gillen.
  Neutral
Each spouse asks about the background noise on the call, given that its supposedly coming from the office where the spouse has to work late.
  Neutral
Michael spins a tale about how he stepped out for a bite' hes gone to get Chinese.
  Neutral
Mary lies back that she too has gone for Chinese.
  Negative
Michael suggests that she do as he does and get the duck.
  Neutral
If you ask me, Michael says, Its too delicious not to share.
  Negative
The quality of their passion here is not just notable for its audacity but for its crassness' in their rediscovery of each other theyre committing a kind of double betrayal.
  Negative
Which is what makes it fun for them, one suspects.
  Positive
But Jacobs movie does not judge them, and, in fact, its myriad elements, including the music, suggest that it somehow believes in them, not in spite of their flawed character, but because of it.
  Negative
This is a picture with stylization that some will find off-putting, but the actors are totally in sync with it, and its through line is remarkably consistent.
  Positive
The languid pacing is not an arbitrary stylistic tic' it conveys a listlessness that is likely not uncommon to suburban life in Southern California.
  Negative
The movies frankness about the physicality of adultery in late middle age will be much commented on, I suppose, but part of the point Jacobs seems to be making is that such things arent worth making a big deal over.
  Negative
The wisdom of this meticulously crafted film is in its genuine irony, which amplifies steadily throughout until culminating in a moment of real heartbreak that, ironically enough, only sets the stage for a cycle of deceit to begin again.
  Neutral
