Anthony Keller Taylor  John Smith is a very hot New York City high-school basketball player.
  Positive
An ace scorer who makes three-pointers look effortless.
  Positive
Not a height monster' doesnt need to be.
  Neutral
Only problem is that Anthonys a bit tender-hearted.
  Negative
This movie opens with him and some pals looking at the legendary players of the basketball courts on Sixth Avenue and West  th  Street' they cant do the kind of cutthroat stuff of street basketball.
  Negative
A coach at Cornell, where Anthony hopes to get a scholarship, asks him straight out how much Anthony wants it, as they say.
  Negative
Did I say only problem?
  Neutral
Its not the only problem.
  Neutral
Another problem is Anthonys dad, a professor and we come to presume failed novelist whos also a compulsive some would indeed say degenerate gambler  and an alcoholic to boot.
  Negative
Lee Keller  Michael Shannon can be a source of good advice for his son the tip he gives him on how to handle an opponent whos crowding him on defense proves very useful, not least because its ruthless in a way that Anthony himself would never be on his own but hes also a welter of resentment, and seeing his kid succeed where he himself failed feeds that resentment.
  Very negative
So when Anthonys high-school team makes the finals of their division, you can see the dilemma that going to emerge.
  Positive
And sure enough, it does.
  Negative
Wolves, written and directed by  Bart Freundlich, trucks in a good number of very familiar situations Anthony has love troubles, too, imagine but because his movie is steeped in so much convincing detail, and is so well-acted, it winds up being at the very least consistently watchable and at the very best effective enough you forget the commonplaces.
  Negative
Michael Shannons handling of Lee is, naturally, outstanding.
  Very positive
Hes a writing teacher, and in the opening scenes, Freundlich gets a bit too clever showing scenes of Lee waxing pedagogic on storytelling.
  Negative
But because Shannon so completely inhabits the erudite but tightly wound interiority of the character, its not too glaring.
  Negative
Theres an almost uncomfortable close-knit intimacy in the scenes of Anthonys home life' Lee, mom Jenny  Carla Gugino and Anthony share a small apartment, eat in a dimly lit area off the kitchen, and because theres still a strong sexual attraction between mom and dad, and because Anthony himself is trying to keep his new-found sex life active, the domestic dynamic has an unusual awkwardness.
  Negative
It works because, among other things, the Keller house is nevertheless full of secrets, the biggest one having to do with just how much in debt Lee is to a gaggle of local bookies who operate out of the bar where Lee drinks himself stupid and makes side bets on televised sports.
  Negative
Gugino is very strong in a role thats far less prominent than Shannons, and  Taylor John Smith, a young performer whos been acting since , is convincing in all the dimensions he has to satisfy.
  Positive
He does good by his decent but often confused character, and also by the physical demands of the role.
  Positive
The movie gets basketball, and it depicts both the raucous Washington Square version of the game and the often overeager exertions of high school athletes with equal care and affection and accuracy.
  Positive
As things go south in Anthonys home, and complications in his relationship with girlfriend Victoria  Zazie Beetz emerge, he seeks guidance from one of the street players, who goes by the name Socrates  John Douglas Thompson.
  Negative
This is Anthonys one good idea in terms of coping.
  Positive
Tensions between him and his dad worsen, and he begins acting out destructively, and Smith is particularly good at conveying Anthonys befuddlement he knows he isnt like this, so why is he behaving as if he is?
  Negative
Director Freundlich clearly likes to dig in deep with this kind of character material, and here it pays off in ways it really hasnt in some of his previous feature work which includes Trust the Man and The Rebound.
  Positive
All of the forces pushing and pulling at Anthony converge, conveniently enough, at the final game of the finals.
  Positive
The climax is, to tell the truth, as ridiculous as it is suspenseful.
  Negative
But it also kind of works, particularly because of the very dire nature of Anthonys final decision, which one might only apprehend fully after the credits have rolled.
  Positive
