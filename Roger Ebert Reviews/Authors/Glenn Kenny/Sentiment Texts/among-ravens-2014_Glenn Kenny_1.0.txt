One can learn a good deal from watching "Among Ravens."
  Neutral
Those viewers keen on noting the passing of historical time will find out, if they didnt know already, that the demographic sometimes known as Generation X is now old enough to warrant its own " The Big Chill"-wannabe what happened to our values and aspirations movie.
  Negative
Viewers keen on birds will learn an awful lot from the movies pivotal character, Chad, a self-described nature filmmaker, a bit younger than most of the films adult characters, who is deposited into a group of pals chilling at a prime piece of real estate porn over a July  weekend, and who when hes not being kinda-sorta Aspergers ish the characters symptoms, which are depicted in glossy movie generalized tics to begin with, are ultimately meant to signal a kind of mystic presence drops some choice morsels of science about our flying friends.
  Negative
Much of this information is intended to work as metaphor.
  Neutral
As in if the baby bird is unfeathered, you can look for a nestand if you find it, you can bring it home.
  Positive
The movie is also apt, though, to bring up some questions in the mind of a viewer.
  Very positive
I myself was kind of curious as to how, at a time when it seems so many of the best film directors are moving over to television because the feature filmmaking process cant accommodate their artistic ambitions, this pompous, know-something-ish, navel-gazing, indulgent, pissy, priggish, albeit reasonably well-photographed, pile of sick got financed to completion.
  Negative
Because "Among Ravens" is, finally, a thoroughly noxious concoction.
  Negative
Ravens were once among the most colorful of birds, begins the narration from the young girl Joey  Johnny Sequoyah, the best performer in the movie.
  Positive
Joey sees her extended family as raven-like.
  Neutral
Her biological dad, a best-selling author named Saul King, who refers to himself as  The King, lists An Unkindness of Ravens as among his tomes.
  Negative
So the metaphors, you see, start hitting right off the bat, as the movie introduces a schlubby life-coach character Calum Grant and his super-post-hippie-dippie teen girlfriend Castille Landon, playing a terribly unappealing variant on the  Meg Tilly character in "The Big Chill", Joeys conflicted-about-being-bourgeois mom Wendy  Amy Smart, Wendys strapped-for-income but not-wanting-to-show it husband Ellis  Joshua Leonard, all bantering and trading success stories until oddball Chad  Will McCormack comes along.The stranger-who-upends-the-lives-of-complacent-characters trope is one with long cinematic history, and as soon as you get a long look at McCormacks goofy mug you hope this isnt going to be a " Teorema"-style seducing scenario.
  Negative
Thankfully, it is not.
  Negative
Chad shakes things up just by acting inappropriate inappropriate enough that in a plausible scenario, Ellis would have been driving him to the nearest Super  about three minutes after Chad had showed up in his dining room and then being strangely wise, just like little Joey.
  Negative
The tyke has her big moment of gravitas when, after her mom compares life to a garden and explains that sometimes you need to pull out the weeds, she asks, Who decides whats a weed?
  Negative
Well, theres another worthwhile question, I suppose.
  Negative
For this viewer, the distinctions between weeds and ravens and bad actors the most egregious offender is co-director  Russell Friedenberg as Saul King' his envy of  Justin Therouxs career is palpable in his ever macho sneer had turned entirely academic by this point in the film.
  Negative
Early in my notes, I put down that, unlike "The Big Chill," this movie doesnt feature a suicide.
  Negative
Eventually spoiler alert the movie proved me wrong.
  Negative
I can only say that Im happy it wasnt me, although I was getting close.
  Positive
