Dorothy Parker originated that immortal line, in , expressing, under her The New Yorker pen name Constant Reader, what would turn out to be very much a minority opinion on A.A. Milnes The House At Pooh Corner.
  Negative
It occurred to this reviewer as he attempted to grapple with the oppressive, bloodless, winsome gentility of  To , a romantic comedy written and directed by  Victor Levin and set in a New York City where its protagonistnarrator tells you in the first five minutes or so, youre never more than twenty feet away from someone you know, or someone youre meant to know.
  Negative
Said protagonistnarrator is a fellow in his s named Brian and, as you may have guessed, this motion picture does not depict him taking the subway a whole hell of a lot.
  Negative
Brian, played by  Anton Yelchin, is a young wannabe writer whose study wall is festooned with rejection letters on paper, even from august publications, but the steady stream of do-not-wants does not stop him from continuing to ply his whatever it is' the fiction editor of The Atlantic, Brian tells his mom, said sorry in the latest rejection, which to him is a sign of progress.
  Negative
One afternoon while out maybe trying to acquire Life Experience to feed his fiction, Brian meets a most enchanting French woman, Arielle  Brnice Marlohe, and after getting off to a poorish start with a Little Mermaid reference, recovers with some wry in-French banter about how to be a smoker in New York these days is to be a kind of exile, and she mysteriously offers to meet him again between the hours of the films title.
  Negative
As it happens, Arielle is married, not unhappily, but its just that shes so French she can take a lover, as her husband has, and while this proposition temporarily affronts Brians sense of ethics, he soon gives himself over to a new kind of amour, and why not.
  Negative
So far, so tolerable, and when Brian and Arielle share a champagne toast in a long, unbroken take in her gorgeous apartment and Arielle responds to one of Brians bromides with Maybe you should write fortune cookies, so moderately sharp.
  Negative
But somewhere before the halfway point the movie crosses a line, and its fantasy version of New York, not to mention of French women, gets to looking kind of hoary and inadvertently adolescent.
  Negative
Eventually, the fact that the characters are all aware of the multiple clichs theyre uttering an exchange between Brian and a young editor  Olivia Thirlby is particularly excruciating in this respect doesnt redeem or excuse the clichs.
  Negative
Writerdirector Levin, an old television hand, is clearly looking to make his own Stolen Kisses his Truffaut fandom extends to strategically placing a Jules And Jim clip in the movie but the stupefying level of wish fulfillment here makes the film play, oddly, like a much more refined Killing Zoe.
  Negative
Yes, the  movie in which a callow bro played by  Eric Stoltz makes a gorgeous French call girl fall madly in love with him in the first ten minutes.
  Negative
Speaking of Stoltz, he appears here, playing an editor named Jonathan Galassi, which is also the name of a very real New York-based book person, and its odd that an actor should be playing the role since Levin, who must be very well-connected, persuaded luminaries such as  Julian Bond and Daniel Boulud to appear in cameos as themselves.
  Negative
The oddest cameo is by David Remnick, the real-life editor of the real-life New Yorker, appearing as himself and proclaiming Brians fiction-writing talents in case you werent able to guess this, his affair with Arielle really agitates his muse, and stuff to Brian and Brians parents played by  Glenn Close and  Frank Langella in a very confusing scene.
  Very negative
I wondered whether Remnick had lost a bet at first.
  Neutral
I then reflected that in the weirdly rarified world this movie wants to depict, a New Yorker editor would not be caught inanimate doing a cameo in any film, let alone one as mediocre as this one, and this paradox set my head a-spin a little bit.
  Very negative
But by the time the picture wound down to its finale, with the narration spouting a bunch of unearned platitudes about perfect love as Truffaut knew, and communicated in Stolen Kisses and elsewhere, theres no such thing, and imperfect love is something to be unequivocally treasured and one of its characters sporting tortoise-shell-rimmed glasses to connote the Passage Of Time, the only thing in my mind was that Dorothy Parker phrase.
  Negative
