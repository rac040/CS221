When the studio that gave the world  Paul Blart: Mall Cop opts to back a torn-from-the-international-headlines socially-conscious based-on-true-events movie, common sense may tell you to head for the hills.
  Negative
So Im both surprised and somewhat gratified to be able to say that the Relativity production Desert Dancer, based on the true life story of a dance performer and underground impresario going up against the repressive Iranian regime and its more thuggish supporters is, while hardly perfect, a movie that frequently displays surprising sensitivity and sensibility.
  Positive
The first feature from director  Richard Raymond, from a script by  Jon Croker, Desert Dancer gets off on its particular foot by morphing Farsi characters into English ones, and enacting its Iran-based drama with a largely English-born cast, speaking in English.
  Negative
Okay, then' international-headline socially-conscious movies tend to do better business in English-speaking countries if theyre in English.
  Negative
Good thing Iran is such a cosmopolitan country, as it makes the language seem less forced.
  Negative
Im making a joke, but not entirely Iran IS a cosmopolitan country even in its current oppressed form.
  Negative
The home to great poetry, an opening-text title says shades of the pre-action apologia for  Argo.
  Positive
There are ever different currents flowing in its culture, and the movie shows young, dance-crazy Afshin Ghaffarian taken up by one of those currents.
  Negative
Punished at his official school for dancing in front of classmates dancing, while not officially illegal in the country, is highly frowned upon by the morality police of particular administrations Afshin is then invited to attend an underground arts school, where he sees on film for the first time  Rudolf Nureyev.
  Negative
Hes then hooked, and when he gets to the University of Tehran about a decade later, hes ready to hook up with a new group of friends who introduce him to secret dance clubs.
  Negative
Its more than just leisure for these young people' the kids are also prominent in the countrys green movement, hoping to displace the doctrinaire Ahmadinejad regime with the more liberal Mir Hossein Mousavi.
  Negative
In the midst of all this foment, Afshin dares his new pals to join him in forming a dance troupe.
  Negative
A nifty idea, except none of Afshins friends are real dancers.
  Neutral
Theyre plenty game, though, and they find a practice space in a relatives abandoned printing plant.
  Negative
And there they are joined, unexpectedly, by another student, the beguilingly beautiful Elehah  Freida Pinto, whose mother was a star in a before-the-revolution Tehran ballet company.
  Negative
The haunted Elehah has massive chops, steely determination, and a lot of baggage, including a proclivity for smoking heroin.
  Negative
These and other obstacles force Afshin, whos initially a real wide-eyed Gotta Dance!
  Negative
type, to grow up pretty quick.
  Neutral
Things get more critical after the  elections, which Mousavi loses, and which triggers a backlash against green movement supporters by paramilitary basiji, one of whom, in this story, is the older brother of one of Afshins college friends.
  Negative
As the makeshift troupe arranges to stage a performance in the one environment in which there is no regime that is, a desert region almost  kilometers outside of Tehran, one of their number is under enormous pressure to betray them.
  Negative
The movie can get almost as melodramatic as that plot description sounds, but it is also dotted with refreshing moments.
  Positive
Its depiction of the internal tensions in Iranian politics and culture is not what youd call super-nuanced, but it is sympathetic to Iran as an entity.
  Positive
The performers are all first rate, and Reece Richie is especially good in the physically demanding role of Afshin.
  Positive
Pinto is equally excellent, and her heart-stopping beauty has never been used quite so effectively in a film before, which is saying something.
  Positive
The cinematography is beautiful, and for every two scenes that are obvious on-the-nose thumps, theres one that is more subtle and affecting' particularly noteworthy is the desert dance that gives the movie its title.
  Very positive
