Director McG and producer  Luc Besson just cant drag  Kevin Costner down to their level, try as they might.
  Negative
The " This Means War" helmer and the man responsible in some way or another for the " Taken," "Transporter," and " Taxi" movies plunk the aging action star into a fairly cynical live-action cartoon whose ostensible quirkiness has become its own form of clich, and Costner responds by bringing an easy integrity and seemingly effortless humanity to his part.
  Positive
And hence making a messy, meandering and silly movie rather more watchable than it deserves to be.
  Positive
From the get-go you know what kind of tripe "Kill" is: the overdetermined, overblown, overdesigned type a EuroTrash action movie, if you will.
  Negative
One in which the explosions are almost as loud as the real-life kind that make people deaf, and the villain looks like he stepped out of a "Saturday Night Live" parody of a Prada advertisement.
  Negative
In the middle of the sound and fury of an opening battle, Costner is stolid and solid.
  Positive
Then his character learns that hes got a virulent form of cancer, and only months to live.
  Neutral
The C.I.A. thanks you for your service, his attending physician tells him.
  Positive
Right.
  Neutral
Acting on advice to get his affairs in order, Costners character, who doesnt speak a word of French, goes to his flat in Paris, discovers a family of Africans squatting there, tries to go all middle-period Eastwood on them, doesnt, and then looks up his estranged wife and estranged teenage daughter.
  Negative
Promise me one thing, estranged wife  Connie Nielsen says.
  Negative
Promise me youre not working for them anymore.
  Negative
Sure enough, Costner promises.
  Negative
And sure enough,  Amber Heard, a mysterious presence in the opening scene, and made up throughout to look as if she just stepped out of a Tex Avery animated short, turns up offering to cure his cancer if hell, yes, work for them again, this time killing bad guys known as The Wolf and The Albino.
  Negative
His new assignment happens to coincide with a lets-get-reacquainted period between father and daughter.
  Neutral
The upshot of which, at times, involves Costners character torturing various lower-level criminals while, get this, soliciting their advice on parenting.
  Negative
This is the main comic device of the movie scenario, and its a pretty uncomfortable one.
  Positive
This is one of those movies thats ridiculously busy with dumb and not particularly pertinent detail on the one hand, and determined to beat all of its near-decent jokes into the ground on the other as in what happens after Costners daughter sets Icona Pops I Dont Care as his cell phone ringtone for her, so when it stops dead for a father-daughter bonding scene in front of Sacre Coeur, the effect is a little unsettling at first.
  Negative
As in, what the hell is this, "Die Hard" meets "Amelie"?
  Negative
Only, because "True Grit" girl Haille Steinfeld is easily winning as the daughter, and Costner is delivering his absolute best Gary Cooper stuff, the scene is actually almost affecting.
  Positive
And so it goes throughout the ridiculous and thoroughly predictable action proceedings when The Wolf says to an associate, Take me to my partners house, he will know how to get me out of Paris, you know exactly who the partner is going to turn out to be, even though you cant believe it.
  Very negative
Costner deserves better, and the fact that he doesnt phone it in here indicates that he thinks maybe so do you.
  Positive
Its worth noting, too, that the movie looks real nice'  Thierry Arbogast, a long time Besson accomplice he even worked with the man when he was doing good, as in " The Fifth Element" imbues the possibly overfamiliar Paris locations with a gold-sepia lighting thats very pleasing.
  Negative
