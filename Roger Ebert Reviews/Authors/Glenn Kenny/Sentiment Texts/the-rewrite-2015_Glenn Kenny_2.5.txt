There was a period spanning from the near-mid s to the early s when a particular kind of  Hugh Grant movie ruled the romantic comedy world.
  Positive
I dont mean every single Hugh Grant movie, but quite a few Hugh Grant movies, mind you.
  Negative
I call them the Redeemable Sts films.
  Neutral
That is, they feature Mr. Grant at his slickest and most glibly charming, except hes a terrible-to-awful cad but not to a Ted Bundy extent, of course, and thankfully except also that he can be saved, and its only through forced exposure to and interaction with Better People that he can be saved.
  Positive
This formula, which arguably reached its commercial and, um, artistic peak with s About A Boy drives Grants latest picture, The Rewrite,  which was written and directed by  Marc Lawrence, who also created s Music and Lyrics, an intermittently diverting rom-com co-starring Drew Barrymore that suggested that maybe a breather from the tried and true might be in order.
  Negative
Unfortunately for Grant, that breather consisted of the universally face-palmed  Did You Hear About The Morgans and the misbegotten Wachowski literary adaptation  Cloud Atlas in .
  Negative
The Rewrite, in which Grant plays a once-acclaimed, now down-on-his-luck Hollywood screenwriter compelled to head east and teach a scenario-crafting class at a university in remote, cloudy, fine-cuisine-challenged Binghamton, New York, must have felt as cozy as a favorite sweater to the actor.
  Negative
And indeed, he gives great Hugh Grant cad once he touches down in the college town, immediately insulting  Jane Austen to an icy department head  Alison Janney whose specialty is Jane Austen, bedding down a comely student  Bella Heathcote even before convening his first session, advising a  Star Wars nerd to join a frat, and dribbling condescension on a plucky single mom whos going to school to improve herself but who may in fact have some real talent.
  Positive
Given that the aforementioned plucky single mom is played by Marisa Tomei, you have an idea where all this is going to end up.
  Negative
And your idea is likely right, although I have to admit I half-lost a bet with myself I made thirty-five minutes in as to what the big third-act turnaround was going to be.
  Negative
I say half-lost because I was correct in terms of the fundamental principle the storyline was bound to uphold.
  Neutral
As predictable as it is, and as sometimes cloying as a few of the movie-insider jokes can get Reynolds or Gosling?
  Negative
one starstruck student breathlessly asks when Grants character alludes to a Ryan having some interest in a fictitious project hes bragging about, this movie earned my almost good rating of two and a half stars on account of the indeed plucky and winning work of the cast, which also includes J.K. Simmons and Chris Elliott as campus types.
  Negative
Each has an amusing moment or three, they all gel pretty well, and they keep the movie watchable as it hops from one sweet-spot-hitting-clich to another.
  Positive
By no means watch this if youre looking for a nourishing cinematic experience.
  Negative
But if your idea of a cozy rom-com is an old Hugh Grant one, this has some cine-comfort-food-carbs for you.
  Negative
