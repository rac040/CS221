"Alive Inside," directed by  Michael Rossato-Bennett, is a passionate documentary with a lot of valuable information to impart, and a laudable humanist agenda to push.
  Positive
Unfortunately, its also not a particularly good movie.
  Very negative
In fact, at certain points it can be an actively annoying one.
  Negative
The subject is how music can awaken the minds of people suffering from dementia andor Alzheimers disease the movie also chronicles, briefly, the music therapy undergone by an MS sufferer.
  Negative
It shows patients reacting to exposure to what had been their favorite music in a different time in their lives, and this footage, although it arguably infantilizes the individuals depicted, also depicts impressive results.
  Positive
The movie goes on to indict the American healthcare systemindustry, which, apparently, is more interested in pushing costly pharmaceutical treatments than any kind of therapeutic model.
  Negative
As a result, souls, hearts, and lives are receding when maybe they dont have to be.
  Neutral
Pertinent well-known experts make their views known.
  Neutral
Neurologist  Oliver Sacks, the author of a book on the effects of music on the brain, offers solid science' musician  Bobby McFerrin is an articulate proponent of those qualities of music that cant be scientifically quantified.
  Very positive
Theyre illuminating.
  Positive
Mr. Rossato-Bennett, alas, is less engaging, and hes the most insistent voice in the film.
  Negative
Crafting the movie as a work of activism, hes pretty much the anti-Nicolas-Philibert, whose films such as "In The Land Of The Deaf" immersed viewers in a different state of being.
  Positive
He frames the experience of the patients through his own lens explicitly from the very start, stating in his narration of working with physician and music therapy pioneer Dan Cohen, What unfolded that first day moved me so much that he had to etcetera, etcetera.The narration We went looking for answers and off-screen questions You like the music youre hearing?
  Negative
Tell me about the music are insistently pushy and intrusive throughout and the visual approach is a greeting-card one, at best.
  Positive
A filmmaker whos always telling us what we ought to be feeling is usually one who cannot actually evoke feeling.
  Negative
And so it is here.
  Positive
The Sacks and McFerrin mini-episodes start coming off as sweet relief as Rossato-Bennett starts laying on the faux-" Koyaanisqatsi" slow-and-fast motion shots, and things reach a particularly eye-rolling level near the end, when the movie turns into an advertisement for itself, reprising a CNN segment in which the filmmaker and Cohen talk about a patient-reaction clip that went viral on social media.
  Very negative
This is understandable as an activist tactic' I get that.
  Negative
But as a segment in a feature documentary targeting an audience of adults, it felt condescending in an especially unwholesome way.
  Negative
Whether or not this approach actually succeeds in getting changes made to the system, the subject, and the human subjects, deserve something a lot better than what this movie gives them.
  Positive
It doesnt feel great to have to say that, but its the truth.
  Positive
