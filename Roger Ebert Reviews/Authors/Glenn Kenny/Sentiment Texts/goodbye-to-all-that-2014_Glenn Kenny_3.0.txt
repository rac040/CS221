The southern-based playwright and screenwriter Angus Maclachlan makes his film directorial debut with this disarming sex comedy about a fellow named Otto whose hapless inattention to certain salient details of his existence leads to the breakup of his marriage.
  Neutral
Otto, played with sly charm and vulnerability by  Paul Schneider, is so in the moment that he tends to discount how a given moment might do some damage, as when he crushes his foot tooling around in a dune buggy with his nine-year-old daughter.
  Positive
Later on, that daughter, Edie  Audrey P. Scott, whos wonderful, tells her mom Annie  Melanie Lynskey, how shes been praying for her dad, because she wants God to be nice to him.
  Positive
Annie doesnt feel like being super-nice to him' soon, with the help of a very take-charge therapist, Annie informs Otto that the marriage is over and Otto is soon out on his own.
  Negative
Upon learning of the affair that prompted Annies action, Otto returns to the dating pool and is both bemused and frustrated to learn that love interests both old and new, played by an array of attractive actresses that go from  Heather Graham to  Anna Camp to Ashley Hinshaw to  Heather Lawless, are largely interested in falling into bed with him and not much else.
  Negative
Theres a lot of good awkward fun to be had as the viewer simultaneously laughs at Ottos expense and hopefully commiserates a bit with him.
  Positive
Particularly hilarious and cringeworthy is a scene of a nude sit between Otto and young, lissome Mildred Hinshaw, whos very into chat prior to sexual activity.
  Negative
I like that you have calluses on the palms of your hands, Mildred coos to Otto, and the look on Schneiders face as he regards his distinctly un-callused palms the guy works as a web designer, for heavens sake is priceless.
  Negative
The movie is replete with little eccentric touches of behavior, dialogue and performance.
  Negative
Its in a totally different register than the two prior Maclachlan pictures Ive seen, the affectionate and quirky Southern family drama  Junebug , directed by  Phil Morrison and the intense spiritual allegory  Stone , directed by  John Curran.
  Positive
Theres almost a sense of male wish-fulfillment in the parade of truly luminous women who come into Ottos life, but this makes the humor of their subsequent eccentricities that much more potent, as in Camps sexual super-freak who, after an intense bout with both Otto and a sex toy quietly avers I wanna read my Bible.
  Positive
Otto and Maclachlan seem to embody the same attitude towards women: affection and nearly awe-filled respect combined with a certain amused exasperation.
  Positive
Its slightly ironic that by then end of this concise films story arc, the most ostensibly sane of Ottos romances makes him the most outlandish proposition, to which Otto replies: Can I?
  Negative
Whether he can and whether he does is addressed in the movies coda, and movie lovers looking for an unusual, quirky, regionally sensitive autumn in North Carolina has never looked more appealing in a film will enjoy taking the brisk, entertaining journey to the place of Ottos resolution.
  Positive
