Anchored by a spectacularly committed performance by Sarah Bolger best known for TVs The Tudors and Once Upon A Time, Emelie is a tidy and nasty and often effective thriller that doesnt quite blossom into full horror.
  Positive
That might come as something of a relief, as this is a bad-babysitter movie, one in which three children of fair to more-than-middling adorableness are threatened and terrorized in increasingly creepy and harrowing ways.
  Negative
The movie begins with a terrific hook: the sound of a seemingly self-absorbed Millennial talking into a cell phone, complaining she cant go to some social function because she got rooked into a babysitting job.
  Positive
We see the young woman, walking down a suburban street in grey weather.
  Negative
A town car stops, the driver asks the young woman for directions, the young woman gets off the phone, starts to try to help, and wham, shes assaulted from behind and bundled into the car, which drives off.
  Very negative
The camera, which was viewing this from a distance, pans left, and the view of the action is obscured by thick out-of-focus tree branches.
  Negative
The direction here, by  Michael Thelin, a TV and music video veteran here making his first feature, is assured, almost inventive.
  Positive
And now the audience knows, right off the bat, that the babysitter later picked up by suburban dad Dan  Chris Beetem is not who she seems.
  Positive
Dan is taking his wife out for their thirteenth anniversary hmmm and leaving Bolgers  Anna to look after sullen -year-old Jacob and super-moppety Christopher and Sally.
  Negative
At first the new babysitter seems cool she liberates Jacobs game handheld from confiscating mom and tosses it to him with could it be?
  Negative
seductive insouciance.
  Neutral
Soon shes supervising lets pretend games with the younger kids, letting them tear apart the good living room cushions to make costumes, and telling them Pretending is a super power.
  Positive
And when you get really good at it, nobody can tell youre pretending anymore.
  Negative
Things take an even more aiiieee turn during a game of hide-and-seek, in which Jacob finds Anna  sitting on the toilet.
  Negative
Jacobs initially presented as a problem child but it becomes pretty clear that the scenario is going to call for him to step up to some kind of plate.
  Negative
He looks into the new sitters bag and finds out, among other things, that her name is not Anna but rather, yup, Emilie.
  Negative
At this point in the film, which has been pretty relentlessly tense and unnerving, some conceptual cracks start to show.
  Negative
Emelies a malevolent presence, to be sure, but shes also someone who wants something, and theres this thing in movies like this wherein the ratio of aberrant behavior thats not useful to the characters goal and aberrant behavior that IS useful to the characters goal goes somewhat askew for the sake of scares.
  Negative
Theres a point where the audience member stops thinking, Yikes, this character is trouble, and starts thinking, Okay, whats the deal with this weirdo?
  Negative
So, yes, alas, the movie crosses that line.
  Positive
Worse, once the filmmakers get around to illuminating Emelies rationale, the backstory and its attendant components are pretty weak and unconvincing tea.
  Negative
I know its not easy constructing a good satisfying basis for your evil babysitter but they should have put in a little more effort, frankly' its part of what would have made the difference between an passable, occasionally interesting thriller and a really outstanding one.
  Negative
Jacob does step up to the plate, and the result is reasonably satisfying, but the direction shifts from tensile to muddy in the run-up to the finale.
  Negative
Emelie has enough good stuff in it that I wished I liked it better, and committed genre hounds may think Im nitpicking here.
  Positive
I choose to not, however, complain about the movies weird mix of props: when Emelie shows the kids a very inappropriate video, its from a VHS tape, and on a CRT TV' while theres plenty of cell-phone communication here, its mostly on flip models, and a touch-tone desk phone features prominently.
  Very negative
I fretted a bit about all this anachronistic hardware, but then I saw in the credits that the movie was shot in Buffalo, New York, and it all made sense' those people hang on to old tech out of spite.
  Negative
