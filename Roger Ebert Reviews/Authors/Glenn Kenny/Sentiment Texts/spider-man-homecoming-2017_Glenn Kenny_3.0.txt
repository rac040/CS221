I am a little out of touch with the inside-baseball commentary on superhero movie and sci-fi franchises, so I have to ask the reader to indulge me a bit.
  Negative
Im perhaps not the best person to draw the distinction between something called fan servicing, which I understand is very, very bad, and giving an audience what it wants, which I have been told from an early age is at least kind of good.
  Negative
That said, I can report from where I sat at a preview screening that was evenly divided between what I suspect were sympathetic-from-the-get-go reviewers and enthusiastic fans and their families, Spider-Man: Homecoming is a comprehensively crowd-pleasing success.
  Positive
This is the second movie to star  Tom Holland as Spider-Man in this incarnation after  Captain America: Civil War.
  Negative
Both the superhero and his high-school-student alter-ego or is it the other way around?
  Neutral
Thats another thing I can be hazy on Peter Parker, are presented at their most awkwardly adolescent.
  Negative
In the timeline of the MCU Marvel Cinematic Universe, Spider-Man: Homecoming begins directly after Spider-Mans participation in a superhero gang fight in s Civil War.
  Negative
But the movie itself begins eight years prior to that, in the aftermath of Loki unleashing the Chitauri, which trashed much of NYC and the Avengers sleek headquarters in s  The Avengers.
  Negative
Thats a  movie, and its only  now, but dont look at me, Im just going by the on-screen texts.
  Negative
In the wreck of the Avengers HQ,  Michael Keatons hard-working salvage dude Adrian Toomes is showing a colleague a drawing of the Avengers scrawled by Toomes own ten-year-old child.
  Negative
Those in the audience with a familiarity with possibly fake Chekhov quotes will recognize this as the gun on the mantelpiece in Act One that is obliged to go off in Act Three, and by Odin, off it does indeed go, but its a long way from Act One to Act Three.
  Negative
Soon Toomes and his crew are kicked off the site by an officious  Tyne Daly and its revealed that Tony Stark is ostensibly self-dealing by heading a government clean-up crew to handle the superhero mess.
  Negative
To give credit to the six screenwriters on this movie, the oodles of rather convoluted plot detail are relatively clear even if youre not super-paying-attention.
  Negative
Spider-Man: Homecoming sees Peter Parker being shunted aside by his adult mentors Tony Stark  Robert Downey Jr. and Happy Hogan  Jon Favreau to tackle the more down-to-earth challenges of high school on his own.
  Neutral
These include Parkers pushy best friend Ned  Jacob Batalon, who wants to know all about Peters internship at Stark Enterprises' the High School Academic Decathlon College Bowl for high schoolers, that is, whose captain Liz  Laura Harrier Peter has a major crush on' and Peters guardian Aunt May  Marisa Tomei from whom Peter must hide his amateur crime-fighting activities as Spider Man, and protect from the possibly wayward affections of a local sandwich shop manager.
  Negative
This version of Peter Parker is less cocky than the prior incarnations of recent years.
  Negative
He is also rather whiny a lot of he time.
  Negative
The Peter Parker I grew up with was agonizingly tetchy, but he didnt hunch over like a weasel whenever he had to get out of a social situation to go fight crime.
  Negative
While Holland hunches over with sincerity and skill, I have to admit I am not enthralled by this variation on the teen superheros alter-ego I dont think I got it right this time either.
  Negative
Peter Parker as nerd, I can roll with' Peter Parker as dork, not so much.
  Negative
That said, once the movie gets all its ducks in a row and after serving up a Queens-set crime fighting foray that highlights some of the movies worst visual effects, looking flat-out like video game action for most of its length, it delivers some genuinely effective actionsuspense set pieces, including one set in the Washington Monument that worked me up a treat.
  Positive
A subsequent near-disaster on the Staten Island Ferry is less effective, but does lead to the movies most effective narrative coup.
  Negative
That is, the nifty Spidey suit that Stark afforded Parker is taken away, and Spider-Man: Homecoming has to swing to its thrilling climax with its hero in a very low-rent outfit.
  Very negative
Is this the opposite of fan-serving, or is it fan-serving itself, presented in a cleverly inverted form?
  Positive
I cannot say.
  Neutral
I can say that the films adaptation of one of the original Spider Man comics most graphically exceptional scenes, from s Issue , The Final Chapter!
  Positive
um, isnt as good as the comic book was, quite honestly.
  Positive
But I give director  Jon Watts and the other seventy thousand craftspersons involved in this production credit for trying.
  Negative
I cant emphasize enough that these are my personal impressions, and I understand they are probably going to be out of step with those of the masses of people who are going to attend this movie and have a good time with it.
  Positive
This is a picture designed to provide bright vivid thrills and breezy bits of amusement.
  Very positive
As someone whos kind of trained to notice such things, I might say This movie really wastes the talents of  Hannibal Buress and  Martin Starr' whereas a less concerned person will see these performers and say, Oh yeah, those guys are funny.
  Positive
Marvel movies are not concerned with altering your precious bodily fluids.
  Negative
This one is a slightly better than average example of the species.
  Positive
Watch it in good health.
