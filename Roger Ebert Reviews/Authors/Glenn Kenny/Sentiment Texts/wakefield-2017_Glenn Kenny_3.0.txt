The idea of just walking away from a seemingly settled life is one thats gotten a pretty good workout in both film and literature.
  Positive
The  short story Wakefield, by American literary giant E.L. Doctorow, put a particularly funny and dark spin on the theme.
  Positive
One evening after a tough commute back from the city, New York suburbanite Harold Wakefield chases a raccoon that scurries up to the attic of his houses standalone garage.
  Negative
Once secure that the pest is gone, Wakefield pauses.
  Negative
From the garages windows he can see inside his own house.
  Positive
His beautiful wife Diane  Jennifer Garner, with whom married life has soured' his twin daughters, who treat him as a stranger.
  Neutral
Wakefield, on an impulse, decides to stay in the garage overnight.
  Negative
To see what happens, at least that what he thinks at first.
  Negative
The screenwriter and director  Robin Swicord, sticking pretty closely to the specifics of the storys events, has made a smart, intriguing, sometimes provocative and often oddly moving picture of Wakefield.
  Positive
The movie is dedicated to Doctorow, who died in .
  Negative
Bryan Cranston plays the title role, and in the opening scenes, as he strides through Grand Central Station and dictates dark legal edicts and predictions into his iPhone, he exudes cold, buttoned-up authority.
  Negative
Once hes set up camp in the garage attic, he becomes curious about their reaction to his disappearance, curious about the people Diane consults with her mother, the widow Babs as Wakefield refers to her, and a younger, handsomer colleague of Wakefields are among them, and they both arouse his ire, which we infer he never kept well-hidden in his former domestic life anyway.
  Negative
But more than that, hes cackling with glee over all the misanthropic bile he can cook up while looking at them.
  Negative
Referring to his former life as a prison cell where the light is never turned out, he lets his petty sadistic misanthropic thoughts run riot even as he scavenges the neighborhood dumpsters for food.
  Negative
The premise sometimes feels like Melvilles Bartleby the Scrivenerchanneled through  John Cheever.
  Negative
But Doctorow was not as despairing a writer as those other American masters.
  Negative
He was a progressive humanist, albeit an always tough-minded one.
  Positive
Swicord brings this perspective to bear on her cinematic vision of Doctorows story.
  Positive
When Wakefield is discovered by a couple of sweet-wide-eyed residents of the house next door a learning center for differently-abled children, which, Wakefield boasts, he was all in favor of, but Diane expressed many not-in-my-backyard concerns about the hardened viewer may roll his or her eyes in anticipation of the threatening teachable moment in which Wakefield rediscovers the joy of family.
  Negative
While his interactions with these two kids, played with great unaffected loveliness by  Pippa Bennett-Warner and  Isaac Leyva, do yield a share of magic moments, thats not the epiphany to which the movie is headed.
  Negative
Because Wakefields too twisted up for that.
  Negative
The sexual dynamic of his marriage, the dissembling with which he won his wife over, and other related factors make him unable to let go of his attachment even as he lets all his responsibilities go to hell.
  Negative
Once Wakefield is near full scary-looking derelict mode, the movie flashes back  years, to his courtship.
  Positive
And here it stumbles a bit, because while Jennifer Garner at  can still pretty plausibly play  or even , Bryan Cranston at  doesnt do  very well, and I dont think hes supposed to be playing .
  Negative
I know this is the sort of objection brought up by folks that  Alfred Hitchcock disdained as plausibles, but given that the movie is so well-crafted in other respects, the effect of no effect aside from makeup making the actors look a little ruddier, there seems not to have been much effort put into de-aging threw me out of the movie for a little while.
  Negative
That aside, Wakefield is kind of a wonder.
  Positive
Especially at a time when so many American indie films are steeped-to-drowning in the gestalt of the Millennial couch-sleeper.
  Neutral
The frankness of the key performances is consistent and sometimes startling.
  Positive
Even though half of her screen time consists of her being seen but not heard, Garner has a consistent crispness' her character is simultaneously transparent and slightly enigmatic.
  Negative
And master Cranston clearly recognizes the meal a role like Wakefield represents, and takes his time with it.
  Negative
He plays the part clean and plain, never nudging the audience for sympathy but making them want to ride shotgun with him on his lunatic journey.
  Negative
