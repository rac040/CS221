s U.S. release of  Isao Takahatas amazing animated swan song The Tale of the Princess Kaguya was a gift and a miracle in and of itself, but its also yielding some dividends.
  Positive
The first great movie of , as far as U.S. releases go, is an animated picture that was made in : Takahatas breathtakingly beautiful and quietly but devastatingly moving Only Yesterday, seeing its first screenings here in both its original Japanese-language version and a scrupulously English-dubbed edition featuring the voice talents of  Daisy Ridley,  Dev Patel, and Ashley Eckstein.
  Positive
Only Yesterday is one of a very distinguished handful of feature films that Takahata directed for Studio Ghibli, the outfit founded by Takahatas friend and frequent collaborator  Hayao Miyazaki.
  Positive
Takahatas work has been marked by a determination to take on stories that U.S. viewers wouldnt necessarily associate with animation, for instance his  World War II survival drama  Grave of the Fireflies.
  Negative
Hes also shown interest in expanding and changing up the aesthetic of anime, as in his  My Neighbors the Yamadas, designed in the seemingly minimalist style of Japanese comic strips.
  Positive
Kaguya, which Takahata announced would be the last film he would direct, was a kind of grand summation of his work in terms of both form and content.
  Negative
Only Yesterday is a good companion piece for a number of reasons like Kaguya, it functions as a highly sensitive and empathetic consideration of the situation of women in Japanese society but its also a breathtaking work of art on its own.
  Positive
Theres no fantasy or supernatural element in the movie, but thats not to say that it entirely eschews the fantastic.
  Negative
The main character is a kind of young Japanese everywoman, or everywoman nonconformist.
  Positive
Taeko is a -year-old single salarywoman in  Tokyo.
  Negative
The movie begins with her telling a work colleague that shes off to visit relatives in the countryside.
  Negative
Truth is, she has no actual close relatives there, but rather has signed up to help the family of her brother-in-laws older brother in her destination to harvest safflowers.
  Negative
I didnt expect to bring my fifth-grade self along for the trip, Ridley, speaking with a U.S. accent for those keeping track, Ridley is British and speaks with her native accent in this independent film called The Force Awakens' her costar in that film,  John Boyega, also hails from England but speaks in that film with an American accent' its called acting, in case this all worries you, muses on the soundtrack of the English-dubbed version.
  Negative
And yet here she is.
  Positive
On the train, Taeko relates and relives events from her childhood.
  Negative
Some funny and charming, but most of them sad and disturbing.
  Neutral
The mockery of more popular girls, the awkwardness of waiting for first menstruation, the cruel coldness of a father who refuses to allow her to participate in a semi-pro theatrical endeavor.
  Negative
The persistent squashing of her hopes and dreams helps make her eventual adult solitude make some kind of sense, but the film is not so crude as to make an overt insistence on cause-and-effect.
  Negative
The movie allows Taeko to keep some secrets, in a sense.
  Positive
As I mentioned, there are no overt fantasy elements in the story but the animated format allows visual metaphors for feelings to come to life.
  Positive
On the rare occasion when fifth-grade Taeko feels like shes floating on air, she floats, and a big pink heart appears in the sky.
  Positive
In the flashback sequences, Takahatas spectacular use of negative space the details of a softball field stretching out into a big field of white in the frame, for instance gives a palpable sense of a world only partially regained to the senses.
  Negative
Once Taeko reaches her destination, she strikes up a friendship with young farmhand Toshio, with whom she talks out more of her mid-s trauma.
  Negative
The possibility of a romance is broached, but the films ending, while tear-jerkingly satisfying, is  well, you ought to see it yourself.
  Positive
That it plays under the final credits is noteworthy.
  Positive
The English language version keeps the movie intact I actually saw it for the first time in an unsubtitled Japanese version, via a laser disc I bought in Japan in the early s, such was my Studio Ghibli fandom at the time, Beatles references and cigarette-smoking characters and all.
  Negative
