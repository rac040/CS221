This grim, glum story of Belgian criminal brothers was submitted by Belgium to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for consideration as a Best Foreign Language Film nominee.
  Negative
It was, in a smart move by the Academy, declined.
  Positive
The movie, directed by  Robin Pront from a script by Pront and  Jeroen Perceval whos also one of the films lead actors, is well-crafted up to a point.
  Positive
But the end to which it is crafted is utterly useless.
  Negative
"The Ardennes" begins with a striking image of a man in a ski mask falling feet first into a swimming pool.
  Positive
After extracting himself, he runs to a waiting car' a tense woman sits in the drivers seat.
  Negative
Pulling up the ski mask, we see hes wearing a stocking over his head as well.
  Negative
Uncomfortable.
  Neutral
He orders the woman to drive and she does.
  Neutral
In a courtroom, moments later, stands a defendant the man left behind at the scene.
  Negative
He got caught, he didnt sell out his accomplices, and now hes sentenced to seven years in prison.
  Negative
Kenny, for that is his name, has a scarred face and a flat-top Mohawk hairstyle, so we suspect hes already used to a hardened mode of life.
  Negative
As for Dave and Sylvie, the accomplices, they straighten out.
  Positive
Sylvie gives a moving testimonial at her sober anniversary at a support group.
  Positive
Memo to contemporary directors depicting circles of chairs in support group meetings: just because its a circle of chairs doesnt mean youre obliged to break out the old -degree dolly.
  Negative
Its old.
  Neutral
And boring.
  Negative
Dave has stopped drinking and drugging and keeps his head down at a crummy job at a big car wash.
  Very negative
One day, his boss, who chain-smokes and watches football nonstop in his office, summons him to the phone.
  Negative
Kennys getting out, Daves mom informs him.
  Negative
As it happens, Dave is Kennys brother, Sylvie is now Daves lover but was formerly Kennys lover, Dave and Kennys mom is generally disgusted with both of the boys, and Sylvie is pregnant with Daves child.
  Negative
Hoo boy.
  Neutral
Kennys reentry into society is not helped by his thuggish demeanor, his expectation that Sylvie is going to take up with him again, or pretty much anything else.
  Negative
For what appears to be an unconscionable length of time, we sit with these characters as they try to hide the whole truth from Kenny.
  Negative
And this seems reasonably easy, as Kenny not only has a poor attitude overall but is kind of dumb as well.
  Negative
Eventually, the viewer learns hes not as dumb as all that, although the movie never drops a clue in that direction.
  Negative
And then "The Ardennes" reveals hes also even dumber than all that.
  Negative
In any event, action, such as it is, picks up when Kenny summons Dave to a parking garage, to show his brother that he, Kenny, has stashed a dead body into the rear compartment of his, Daves, car.
  Negative
So begins the final leg of their reunion, from Antwerp to the forested area of Belgium called The Ardennes, the setting of idyllic scenes from more innocent boyhood days.
  Negative
They are not to be revisited this time, as their journey brings them into liaisons with a criminal drag queen and Kennys former cell-mate.
  Negative
The Antwerp depicted in this movie looks like some kind of purgatory on earth' theres never a sunny day, its always wet and murky out, people look malnourished or generally sickly.
  Negative
Kenny distinguishes his status as a Lucifer-like figure by skulking around in a bright red puffy jacket, the most vivid visual in this deliberately grey and dank film.
  Negative
The actors co-writer Perceval is Dave,  Kevin Janssens is Kenny,  Veerle Baetens who was outstanding in another miserable Belgian film, s  The Broken Circle Breakdown is Sylvie, and  Viviane de Muynck brings slight echoes of Jackie Weaver in Animal Kingdom to her work as Kenny and Daves mom all do credible stuff here.
  Very negative
But the character examination is utterly predictable, and when the movie breaks free of its domestic discomfort for a road trip with some ridiculousabsurd diversions an intra-criminal standoff is broken up by an animal rampage that ought to have been either hilarious or utterly terrifying, and ends up neither, its merely building to a grisly and repellent punchline that represents tough-boy cinematic nihilism at its most tedious.
  Very negative
