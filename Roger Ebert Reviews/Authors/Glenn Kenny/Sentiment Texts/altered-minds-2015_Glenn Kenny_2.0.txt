This psychological thriller, which first played at small film festivals between the falls of  and , was originally titled The Red Robin.
  Positive
Although red-robin imagery dominates the movie and provides a major plot point, I get why the title was changed to the somewhat more generic current one.
  Negative
Altered Minds does bring to mind the semi-classic  Altered States, true, but its not as grabby by half.
  Neutral
Firstly, theres the chance that people will think of the fast-food chain.
  Negative
More important, had they kept the title The Red Robin, smart-ass movie critics not unlike myself would have had ample, possibly irresistible opportunity to quip along the lines of more like RED HERRING, amirite?
  Negative
and so on.
  Neutral
Written and directed by  Michael Z. Wechsler, Altered Minds opens with a shot of a syringe dropping, just like a penny does, and we dont get that piece of this puzzle movie filled in until much later.
  Very negative
Judd Hirsch plays Dr. Nathaniel Schellner, an aged Nobel-prize winning really!
  Negative
psychotherapist whos on his last legs' he and wife Lillian  Caroline Lagerfelt are hosting a birthday party for him thats also a sort of goodbye dinner for their four adult children, the eldest of whom, Leonard  Joseph Lyle Taylor, whos also in the psych biz, is their sole biological offspring.
  Negative
Harry C.S. Lee, a Vietnamese adoptee, is a proficient classical musician.
  Negative
Biological brother and sister Tommy Ryan ONan and Julie  Jaime Ray Newman were picked up in Russia' Tommys now a horror novelist and Julie seems to kind of look after everybody.
  Negative
Tommys a little odd' hes first seen, not at his folks cozy suburban home, but nearby, digging up someone elses property.
  Negative
Seems hes looking for an urn containing the ashes of a beloved family pet.
  Negative
Icicles are dangerous' think about your kids, Tommy rasps to a local mom who reacts to his offer to clear the pointed hangers from her shingles if shell let him shovel in her backyard.
  Negative
Meanwhile, at the house Harry is telling mom I think Im gonna quit the Philharmonic, to which she stammers But but youre one of their best violinists, which ought to give you a general idea as to how this movie tends to handle its exposition material.
  Neutral
Once Tommy finally makes it to home and hearth, things heat up, and the semi-prodigal son, rather studiedly over-acted by ONan, begins accusing previously-dear-old-dad of having conducted heinous psychological experiments on him as a child.
  Negative
This is all indignantly dismissed as nonsense until Harry owns up to suffering from traumatic nightmares featuring imagery Tommy also is haunted by.
  Negative
Some of it having to do with the aforementioned bird.
  Neutral
Wechslers working a bunch of influences here, from  Peeping Tom to Wild Strawberries to  The Celebration to  The Family Stone?
  Neutral
Okay, maybe not.
  Negative
Theres likely some Pinter bopping around in his process as well.
  Negative
But its all in the service of what turns out to be a find-what-the-filmmaker-has-hidden narrative riddle, a pretty well executed one when all is said and done, but a not terribly memorable one either.
  Negative
Hirsch is his usual reliable self, trading in on the warmth and trust he generated as a shrink in  Ordinary People to keep the audience off balance as to whether hes going to turn out to be a savior or a monster.
  Positive
Hes the most distinguished player here, keeping the movie grounded when its plot mechanics andor ONans histrionics threaten to throw it off the rails.
  Positive
