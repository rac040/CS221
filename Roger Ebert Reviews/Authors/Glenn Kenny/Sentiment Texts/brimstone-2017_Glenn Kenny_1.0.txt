Well, if theres one positive thing to say about Brimstone, its that it doesnt lack for lunatic ambition.
  Negative
This Westernhorror picture, the English-language debut of Dutch writerdirector  Martin Koolhoven, is two-and-a-half hours long, has a relatively complicated elliptical flashback structure, and is for the most part what you would call uncompromising in the treatment of its subject matter.
  Very negative
The subject matter, and its treatment, is also what make Brimstone a tedious and repellent viewing experience.
  Negative
The movie begins with what seems a standard enough bit of imagery.
  Negative
A nicely lit shot of the beautiful  Dakota Fanning, looking at the camera as if it were perhaps a loved one looking back at her.
  Positive
She was a warrior, the voice of a young woman says on the soundtrack.
  Neutral
In the old country, you had to be, in order to survive.
  Negative
All right, then.
  Positive
Nothing you havent heard before, nothing you cant handle.
  Negative
The movie shifts out of THAT gear pretty quickly, although it never manages to shake off the dialogue clichs completely.
  Negative
Fannings character is named Liz, and she serves as a midwife to the other residents of her bleak frontier farm town.
  Negative
One bad Sunday, a bearded fellow with a scar running vertically the right side of his face, right over the eye, turns up in the towns austere church.
  Negative
Guy Pearce as The Reverend declaims in a Dutch accent that, as accurate as it may be, sometimes finds him sounding rather like  Bela Lugosi.
  Negative
Directly after he addresses the congregation, a local womans water breaks.
  Negative
Liz tries to assist in birthing in the church itself, and has a quandary: either the mother can live or the child.
  Negative
Liz chooses to spare the mother, and soon both The Reverend and the womans husband are all up in her mute grill.
  Positive
The Reverend seems to be particularly tetchy.
  Negative
Tongueless murderers end up at the stake, it is said at one point.
  Negative
Liz cant seem to make it clear to her family husband, his son by another mother, her daughter just what kind of business The Reverend means.
  Negative
As she flees at the end of the movies first self-proclaimed chapter, titled Revelation, we expect a hot pursuit to follow.
  Negative
But no.
  Negative
Chapter Two, called Exodus, seems to tell a completely different story, about a teenage girl whos running away from something terrible and then winds up being sold to a brothel keeper.
  Negative
As shes hustled upstairs and given something to drink, one of the girls chortles Swallow it right on down, girlie.
  Positive
Soon youll be swallowing something else.
  Negative
This salty dialogue intends to underscore the cruelty of the world to which Joanna will have to become accustomed.
  Negative
After any number of horrors and humiliations endured at Franks Inferno, The Reverend himself, noticeably younger, shows up.
  Negative
Joanna is the girl hes been looking for.
  Negative
In not too short order well, in the next chapter, Genesis, which is indeed the origin story, to be precise, The Reverend is dragging Joanna  Emilia Jones, who maybe suffers the most out of all the female actors in the movie, which is saying something through a path of mud, averring, Ill love you, and you will learn to love me.
  Positive
Spoiler alert: in addition to being a murdering deranged religious hypocrite, The Reverend is also an incest-obsessed pervert, and Brimstone turns out to be all about his pursuit of his daughter and, um, yes, eventually his granddaughter.
  Negative
If youre saying Um, ick, some credulous fans of the film might counter Exactly!
  Negative
promoting Brimstone as some sort of feminist parable.
  Negative
That such a reading is nonsense can be proven merely by watching the work.
  Negative
The Reverend is supposedly loathsome, but Koolhoven rubs the viewers noses in his every depredation, lovingly filming and then piecing together each simulated atrocity the character commits.
  Very negative
I suspect hes only held back by the fact that had he tried, say, to make the scenes of rape visually explicit, his film would be unreleasable, and he himself might well be put in jail.
  Negative
Now, these are, I suppose, valid, albeit ultimately craven in the higher moral sense, reasons for watering down ones artistic vision.
  Negative
But Im not going to make a federal case out it.
  Negative
Which isnt to say that Koolhoven doesnt go far, or even too far.
  Negative
I suppose under a particular artistic circumstance it might be permissible for an adult male performer to say to a five-or-six-year-old actress, Has your mother told you what it means to be a whore?
  Negative
followed soon afterwards by Have you bled yet?
  Negative
This movie does not, I firmly believe, constitute such a circumstance.
  Negative
In any event, by the finale, it is entirely clear that the Reverend is the character with whom Koolhoven actually identifies.
  Negative
Gross.
  Neutral
I wonder if President Trump can extend that travel ban to The Netherlands.
  Negative
Lets not even consider the implausibility of an American pioneer tale in which all anybody ever thinks about is sex, specifically incestuous sex.
  Negative
Empirical evidence indicates this was not actually how the West was won.
  Negative
Brimstone was apparently a passion project for the filmmaker, taking him years to write, driving him to the extent that he didnt take a salary' he turned Hollywood money down when he couldnt get final cut, and he had a near-breakdown that required a trip to the hospital emergency room when it looked like his financing was going to fall through.
  Negative
Im all for heroic exertion in pursuit of ones art, but in this case I wish Koolhoven had tried therapy first.
  Negative
Speaking of pioneers, the long-time rock critic Robert Christgau, back in , condemned Black Sabbaths  LP Masters of Reality as dimwitted, amoral exploitation.
  Negative
He was wrong about the album it rules but as a sharply intelligent phrasemaker he scored big.
  Negative
And his phrase applies almost exactly to Brimstone.
  Negative
