Some time in the first hour of Labyrinth of Lies, its lead character   a young, ambitious, late-'s German prosecutor named Johann Radmann begins to learn the scope of the crimes hes decided to investigate in the hopes of breaking out of trying traffic violation cases.
  Negative
A former Nazi party member has been found to hold a teaching position nearby' this violates German law, although most of the bureaucrats overseeing this sort of thing have been happy to look the other way.
  Negative
It emerges that the school employee was a guard at a place called Auschwitz.
  Negative
Although the Nuremberg trials have already taken place, German reporting on the international court had apparently been sketchy' Radmanns never heard of Auschwitz, and neither have many of his friends and colleagues.
  Negative
Radmann soon finds out enough, and when doggedly pursues justice, never reflects on whether he might have bitten off more than he can chew.
  Negative
Neither does the movie itself, directed by Italian-born actor Giulio Ricciarelli, most of whose filmography is German-based.
  Negative
Ricciarelli co-wrote the script with  Elisabeth Bartel, and while the movies lead character is what they call a composite, the movie is fact-based, concerning the first prosecutions of Nazi war criminals within Germany itself.
  Negative
Theres a compelling cinematic story here, perhaps, but Ricciarellis movie is too diffused and scattered and, especially in its first hour, too reliant on commonplaces.
  Negative
Radmann, played by the handsome but rather stiff  Alexander Fehling, is an almost too-good-to-be-true fiction, the guy who stands in the hallway in an overhead shot while the rest of his colleagues are going to their offices, and then retrieves from a wastepaper basket a document about that Nazi case that none of his fellows want to touch with a ten-foot-pole.
  Very negative
He collaborates with a fiery, feisty German journalist named Gnielka  Andr Szymanski who introduces him to the world of postwar, pre-counterculture Euro bohemia, and these scenes have a certain charm.
  Positive
But crusaders, victims, and perpetrators are all painted with the standard contemporary brush' the bad guys have just enough banality of evil, the survivors have the clichd mix of defeated slouch and stiff spines, and so on.
  Negative
Its rather tiresome, with the bonus of making the viewer feel bad about finding it tiresome.
  Negative
Which means, finally, that its a betrayal of the reality its trying to portray, and one would be better of re-viewing  Shoah again.
  Negative
Radmann becomes obsessed with tracking down one particularly heinous Auschwitz denizen, one Dr. Josef Mengele.
  Negative
If you dont know how that pursuit turnsturned out, well I wont spoil it for youbut by the same token, you should be ashamed of yourself.
  Negative
As Radmann goes off on his own tangents, his boss, the Attorney General Bauer  Gert Voss tries to straighten his focus, working an agenda of his own.
  Negative
As the movie progresses, story themes emerge that are more actively interesting, although theyre not explored with any particular artistry.
  Positive
The deeper Radmann digs, the more Nazis he finds.
  Neutral
Pursuing a line fleshed out in the controversial history account Hitlers Willing Executioners, Radmann discovers that no one is innocent, not even those he once most admired.
  Negative
This proves tough to him to handle.
  Positive
Theres a potentially searing psychological drama in this kind of stuff, and while Ricciarelli does use the material to underscore an object lesson on what the true nature of investigation and justice ought to be, he doesnt take any meaningful artistic advantage of the material.
  Positive
So the movie winds up being to put it kindly mildly intellectually satisfying while entirely emotionally flat.
  Negative
In an interesting side note, an American Army officer who oversees wartime archives, and reluctantly at first assists Radmann in his research, is played by one Tim Williams, whom American viewers may recognize as the somewhat smarmy dude in the ads for travel-discount website Trivago.
  Negative
Hes sarcastic but not particularly creepy here and he speaks excellent German, for what its worth.
  Positive
