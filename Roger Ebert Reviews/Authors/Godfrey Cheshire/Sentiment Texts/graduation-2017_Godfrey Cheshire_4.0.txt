A fascinating and fastidiously complex study of one mans moral choices at a crucial juncture in his life,  Cristian Mungius Graduation is a thoroughgoing masterpiece which offers proof that Romanias cinematic upsurge remains the most vital and important national film movement of the current century.
  Positive
Like other Romanian masterpieces, the film seems to reflect an ongoing concern with the nations fate since the collapse of Soviet Communism and the Ceausescu regime in .
  Negative
While that historic turning point freed Romania from one form of oppression, these films probe the sense that ghosts of the old regime still haunt its successors and that elements of corruption have been internalized to the point that theyre not just social but individual as well.
  Negative
Mungius protagonist this time is a doctor named Romeo Aldea  Adrian Titieni, who is about to turn , which means that hes reached a certain mid-point in life: young enough to have an aged mother needing his attention, old enough to have a daughter about to graduate from high school.
  Neutral
Other signs of mid-lifes challenges: hes got a wife whos as romantically alienated from him as he is from her and a mistress whos threatening to end things if he doesnt leave the wife for her.
  Negative
Of these four women, its the daughter, Eliza  Maria Dragus, who becomes the films dramatic crux as the story begins.
  Negative
One day after Romeo drops her off at school, a stranger drags her into a nearby construction site and attempts to rape her.
  Negative
The attack leaves the girl badly shaken and with one arm in a cast.
  Negative
But the real problem is that it also renders her potentially unable to ace an especially important final exam, one that may determine whether shell be able to accept a scholarship at a British university.
  Negative
This turn of events shakes Romeo far more than it does Eliza.
  Negative
She has a boyfriend here and seems rather blas about whether she goes to school in Romania or abroad.
  Neutral
Her father, though, is totally invested in the idea that she will escape to England, and this is one area where he and his wife still have a common cause.
  Negative
When they were younger, the couple left Communist Romania for the West, and Romeo evidently regrets that they moved back' in his eyes, Elizas salvation will also be his redemption.
  Negative
The doctor considers himself to be a highly principled man, more so than much of the society that surrounds him.
  Neutral
But when Elizas exit from Romania falls into jeopardy, his personal morals start to waver.
  Negative
He knows strings that can be pulled to help the girl get past that exam, and he begins tugging at them.
  Positive
And yes, this inevitably recalls Lenins statement about breaking eggs to make an omelet, and thus the whole Communist ethos of the ends justifying the means.
  Negative
Romeos surreptitious campaign brings him into contact with a small array of policemen, bureaucrats and other doctors who know the system can be gamed, and who are used to gaming it themselves or turning their heads while others do it.
  Negative
In addition to drawing a bead on corruption at the systemic level, these characters offer a striking and memorable portrait gallery of a certain slice of Romanian officialdom at this moment in time.
  Positive
As in his earlier films, including the Palme dOr winner   Months,  Weeks and  Days, Mungiu employs a patented style that involves long takes many scenes entail only a single shot and eye-level widescreen compositions.
  Negative
The effect is of a crisp, unblinking intentness, one that induces the viewer to pay attention to the characters, their words and interactions from a natural, unforced remove.
  Positive
A form of realism this surely is, though its steadfast clarity almost takes us into the realm of the hyper-real.
  Positive
Much as he does on the visual level, Mungiu proves his verbal mastery with a kind of unshowy exactitude in the scripting of characters as well as individual scenes.
  Positive
The people of Graduation are all very believable, both persuasively Romanian and recognizable to anyone in the middle-class West.
  Positive
Which is to say that Mungiu shows us lives that reflect certain looming social forces but that also are too messy and individual to add up to neat moral lessons.
  Negative
Yet its hard not to be impressed with a filmmaker who so precisely fillets the moral choices of people and the society they inhabit.
  Negative
And what a timely film for American viewers to encounter right now, when moral inquiries and understandings seem as foreign to the multiplex as they do to the White House.
  Positive
We can only hope that some of our filmmakers will take a cue from Mungius brilliantly incisive interrogation of his homeland.
  Negative
