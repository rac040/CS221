Set mostly in a hyper-desolate Native American reservation town in Minnesota,  Jack Pettibone Riccobonos The Seventh Fire centers on two sometimes reprehensible but extraordinarily vivid men.
  Negative
Rob Brown, whose tribal name is Two Thunderbirds, has spent many of his  years incarcerated and will soon head back to prison, leaving behind a pregnant girlfriend.
  Negative
Kevin Fineday Jr., approaching his  th  birthday, looks up to Rob and almost seems like his younger self: by all indications, hes headed for a life of crime, prison and gang activity.
  Negative
He too has a pregnant girlfriend.
  Negative
Roger Ebert famously described movies as empathy machines, and Riccobonos film is a powerful example of cinemas ability to grant even the diciest of characters their full humanity.
  Positive
Described in a newspaper article or crime report, Rob and Kevin would inevitably be reduced to two-dimensional types, self-serving lowlifes who contribute nothing to society and are held in contempt even by some closest to them.
  Negative
While not excusing their behavior, The Seventh Fire lets us see both men as complex figures with recognizable feelings and a poignant sense of their own failings and aspirations.
  Positive
The film has three credited writers Riccobono along with co-cinematographer Shane Omar Slattery-Quintanilla and editor  Andrew Ford, yet it is also nominally a work of nonfiction.
  Negative
Though that may seem a bit contradictory, it captures the films sense of comprising a work of faction, forging a drama out of real-life materials.
  Positive
Filmed in catch-as-catch-can verite style, it dispenses with documentary techniques such as titles and narration in order to immerse us into its subjects lives.
  Negative
One result of this approach is that its early sections especially feel a bit scattershot.
  Positive
It takes a while of weaving into Rob and Kevins intertwined lives over a period of months to begin getting a sense of what makes them tick.
  Positive
Yet the dead-end quality of life in Pine Point village or P-Town as its known on the White Earth Indian Reservation is evident from the outset.
  Negative
Its a bleak place of identical cheaply made houses, where residents who want dispense with unwanted furniture simply put it on the curbside and set it on fire.
  Negative
No wonder the main recreational activity for many locals seems to be taking drugs.
  Negative
This is where Kevin intersects with the community professionally.
  Neutral
Hes a new, aspiring part-time dealer, who buys and sells and partakes himself.
  Negative
The film contains several scenes of drug taking.
  Positive
Though one motivation may be financial, this also seems a matter of image and identity: it gives him a macho role to play around his peers, and Kevin, with his shades, fancy haircuts and hip-hop threads, is nothing if not image-conscious.
  Negative
The ubiquitous posters of De Palmas  Scarface here provide an archetype for the narco-thug as a role model for dispossessed young men.
  Negative
Kevins home decorations and taste in tattoo imagery show he also has an awareness of his Native heritage, which in turn suggests that, culturally and perhaps morally, he exists in a divided, conflicted mental space.
  Negative
And indeed, he says he can imagine himself going straight and building a normal life.
  Negative
Yet these words seem like wistful daydreams, while reality is pulling him in a darker, easier direction.
  Negative
His father, evidently having been betrayed too many times, damns him as a liar beyond the pale.
  Negative
Even when he tells the truth, hes lying, Kevin Sr. bitterly scoffs.
  Negative
Rob leads a similarly divided life, one that shows the unhappy destination that Kevin will reach if he continues on the same road.
  Negative
Hes the product of a ruinous upbringing, and here the reviewer must note one of the peculiar advantages of reviewing films on DVD.
  Negative
In a scene where the film very briefly glimpses a document concerning Robs criminal history, I paused the image and read the documents detailed account of the sexual abuse he suffered as a child, and his subsequent misfortunes in being shuttled through a long succession of foster homes.
  Negative
While this history hardly justifies his criminal career, it does point to reasons he would have been involved with a criminal gang called the Native Gangster Disciples from an early age.
  Negative
A side note: Gang activity is alluded to frequently in The Seventh Fire but seldom shown.
  Negative
This is presumably because the filmmakers couldnt gain access to other gang members that they did to Kevin and Rob.
  Negative
Up close, Rob seems a solid guy, never malicious or overtly menacing.
  Negative
Photos of him in Native costume as a young man suggest pride, geniality and hopefulness, qualities which have been hardened but not erased by the time hes facing his fifth trip to prison, for a stay that will keep him inside for over two years.
  Negative
When we follow Rob into the joint, we get to see a facet of his personality that weve only heard mentioned before: Hes an aspiring writer, and his words have the power of conviction and a keen awareness of his lifes tremendous challenges and painful lessons.
  Positive
The Seventh Fire the title refers a prophecy of the Ojibwe tribe has a list of executive producers that includes  Natalie Portman and  Terrence Malick.
  Negative
The latters influence can perhaps be discerned in the films disjunctive, impressionistic narrative and its visual vocabulary, which mixes lyrical views of snow and fields with sternly realistic looks at this worlds grim disarray.
  Positive
But whatever other filmmakers may have had an impact on Riccobono, the films indelible depiction of current Native life is an achievement that belongs to him alone.
  Positive
