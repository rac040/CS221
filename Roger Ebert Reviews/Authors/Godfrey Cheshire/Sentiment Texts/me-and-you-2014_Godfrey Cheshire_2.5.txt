If the intimate Italian drama Me and You came from an unknown director rather than  Bernardo Bertolucci, one of cinemas modern masters, would it be seeing U.S. distribution?
  Negative
Probably not.
  Neutral
With interest in subtitled films in a state of sad and seemingly endless decline, this tale of a boy and his half-sister who hole up in their fathers basement to escape the world might well feel too slight and marginal to attract the attention of art-house distributors.
  Negative
But rather than suggesting why slight and marginal works might as well be avoided, the film points up the continuing benefits of an auteurist approach to cinema.
  Positive
Bertolucci is indeed a master, and Me and You evidences numerous thematic connections to his earlier work as well as constant proof of his distinctive gifts as a stylist.
  Very positive
While it may not have the transformative originality of The Conformist and  Last Tango in Paris or the epic scale of  and  The Last Emperor, its pleasures are sufficient to fully reward the attentions of Bertolucci admirers and perhaps even draw some new fans.
  Positive
Since serious back problems have rendered him unable to stand, Bertolucci has not released a film in nearly a decade.
  Very negative
He might never have worked again, he has said, had he not discovered ways to direct from a wheelchair and found a subject in  Niccolo Ammanitis novella amenable to his lack of mobility.
  Negative
For these reasons, and the fact that he hadnt made a film in Italian in  years, Me and You has an air of renewal and understated ebullience that is one of its chief attractions.
  Positive
In its early sections, the films story focuses on Lorenzo  Jacopo Olmo Antinori, a -year-old with a mop of tousled brown hair, a pimply and usually sullen face, and the first fuzzy hints of a moustache.
  Negative
The picture of contemporary adolescent alienation, the kid has a therapist who thinks hes making headway, though its clear Lorenzo finds school a huge drag and home even worse.
  Negative
His dad buys him expensive gifts but is present only on the phone.
  Neutral
His mother Sonia Bergmasco, an attractive blonde, takes him out to an expensive restaurant, where he annoys her by asking if she would make love with him if they were the last two people left on earth a droll flashback to the incest theme of Bertoluccis  Luna.
  Negative
The kids only happy relationship is with his aged grandmother  Veronica Lazar, but she seems to be in her final days.
  Neutral
When he half-jokes that he wants his coffin placed on top of hers, it gets at what hes really after: total isolation.
  Negative
And he has a plan for that.
  Neutral
When vacation rolls up and his mother drives him to the bus for a school skiing trip, he starts an argument that ends with her ejecting him from the car.
  Negative
He then returns to the old building where his family lives and secretes himself in the cellar, where he has constructed a hideaway that promises him a week in blissful solitude, listening to music on his headphones and fooling his parents with occasional phone calls.
  Negative
But the idyll is almost immediately interrupted by the arrival of Olivia  Tea Falco, his older half-sister by a previous marriage of his father.
  Negative
She is  and model-beautiful but jittery and erratic in her actions.
  Neutral
Its clear that relations between the two have never been very good' there are resentments and grievances on both sides.
  Positive
His main wish, though, is simply to get rid of her, and at first he succeeds.
  Positive
She goes away, but then returns and threatens to scream loud enough to give away his ruse unless she gives her shelter.
  Neutral
And its then that he learns sis has a particularly self-indulgent kind of sickness shes a junkie.
  Negative
For over half of its length, the action in Me and You is confined to the basement where Lorenzo and Olivia hide out, and its almost as if Bertolucci chose to approach this as an interesting formal challenge: how to create an enclosed and claustrophobic situation thats never static or boring.
  Negative
He and cinematographer  Fabio Cianchetti accomplish this with constant changes in lighting and visual angles and Bertoluccis trademark lexicon of varied and elegant camera movements.
  Positive
This is all not only subtly beautiful in itself, its also thematically and psychologically apposite: Because the outside world feels so oppressive and threatening to Lorenzo and Olivia, it makes sense that this place of confinement would feel hospitable, strangely inviting, even liberating.
  Negative
It is a place, too, where they are able to find a kind of solidarity in their troubles, and perhaps even begin to see beyond them.
  Negative
Those familiar with Bertoluccis work might expect that the attractive characters and close quarters here could point toward an erotic destination, as did similar situations in films ranging from Last Tango to  The Dreamers.
  Negative
But Bertolucci is never one to remain stuck in the past.
  Negative
Here eros, the urge toward transcendence, is not sexual but psychological.
  Negative
Its a matter of pushing past boundaries and finding healing in difficulty and self-renewal much as this great director did in making Me and You.
  Positive
