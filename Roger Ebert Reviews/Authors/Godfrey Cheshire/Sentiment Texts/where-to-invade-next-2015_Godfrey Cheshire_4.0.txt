Michael Moores surprising and extraordinarily winning Where to Invade Next will almost surely cast his detractors at Fox News and similar sinkholes into consternation.
  Positive
They get lots of mileage out of painting Moore as a far-left provocateur whos all about running America down.
  Neutral
But his new film is all about building America up, in some amazingly novel and thought-provoking ways.
  Positive
In my view, its one of the most genuinely, and valuably, patriotic films any American has ever made.
  Positive
It comes billed not as a documentary but a comedy, and the first joke is its hilariously misleading title.
  Positive
You think it anticipates a stern, leftist denunciation of American foreign policy.
  Negative
Instead, Moore tells us the Joint Chiefs of Staff invited him to Washington, DC, to confess that all their wars since the big one have been disastrous and ask his advice.
  Negative
He responds by offering himself up as a one-man army who will invade countries populated by Caucasians whose names I can mostly pronounce, take the things we need from them, and bring them back home to the United States of America.
  Positive
So, wearing his trademark baseball cap and literally wrapped in the flag, he sets off across the Atlantic searching out peoples to conquer who have things America needs.
  Negative
Yes, he knows all of these countries have their own share of problems.
  Negative
But hes come, he says, to pick the flowers, not the weeds.
  Negative
And what a bouquet he assembles.
  Positive
First stop is Italy, where he wonders why Italians always look like they just had sex.
  Positive
He finds some reasons for that happy glow in talking to a ish couple hes a cop, she works for a clothing company who start enumerating all the paid vacation time they get.
  Positive
The basic portion, decreed by law, is four weeks, but when you add in government holidays and such, it comes closer to eight.
  Negative
They use all this time to vacation in places like Miami and Zanzibar, so theres more than just sex though we guess theres plenty of that too to explain their radiant tans and satisfied smiles.
  Negative
After hearing about these citizens five months paid maternity leave, Moore invades two Italian companies one makes the famous Ducati motorcycles where he expresses mock-disbelief that such largesse could be good for business.
  Negative
But the CEOs of both firms genially argue that it is.
  Negative
Workers getting such benefits and being allowed two-hour lunches where they can have home-cooked meals makes for a healthier, happier and more productive work force, they say.
  Negative
A union representative notes that these gains have been hard-won and still require struggle.
  Negative
But the picture of an industrial situation where all sides seem to define success as cooperation, health and la dolce vita leads Moore to plant the Stars and Stripes on one factory floor, claiming the idea for the U.S.A. Before considering the other countries he visits, its worth noting that all of this works so well not only because of the ideas presented but also because Moore is such a masterful comic storyteller and skilled polemicist.
  Positive
The film has a very definite point of view, of course' thats what sets it apart from the bland pseudo-objectivity of our corporate news media.
  Negative
But Moore is clever enough to avoid preaching to the choir by also voicing the doubts and skepticism that Americans of other political persuasions would have.
  Negative
After Italy, several episodes focus on different aspects of education.
  Neutral
In France, he visits a provincial elementary school where the students hour-long lunches look like they come from a top Parisian restaurant' this is not only cheaper than the crap American kids are fed, the chef tells him, its also educational since it teaches about food and healthy eating.
  Negative
In Finland, one of the films most startling segments, Moore learns that until a couple of decades ago, student performance was about as lame Americas still is.
  Negative
Then the Finns decided to revolutionize their educational system.
  Neutral
The reforms included eliminating homework and standardized testing and giving students more autonomy and free time.
  Negative
The result: Finland is now number one in educational rankings.
  Negative
In Slovenia, Moore inspects a system where a college education is essentially free, even for Americans who have begun to flock there, unable to afford the exorbitant costs at home.
  Negative
In Germany, the filmmakers look at health care and benefits for middle-class citizens elides into the part of the film thats most likely to draw the ire of American right-wingers, since it concerns how not just education but public policy in general decrees remembering and understanding the Holocaust.
  Positive
Moore says he comes from a great country that was born in genocide and built on the backs of slaves, and wonders whether such recognition of historical sins might actually benefit the U.S. too.
  Neutral
Two other countries prompt questions of crime and punishment.
  Negative
In Norway, Moore investigates a prison system where rehabilitation rather than punishment is the goal, even maximum security lock-ups are tailored to that end, and the maximum sentence is  years the country now has one of the worlds lowest murder rates.
  Negative
In Portugal, he hears that eliminating all penalties for drug use and treating it as a health-care issue instead has resulted in decreased use.
  Negative
He also listens as three Portuguese cops talk movingly about how concern for human dignity is the most important part of their training.
  Positive
Two underlying themes of the film, people power and womens empowerment, converge in the films final two segments.
  Negative
In Tunisia the only non-European and only Muslim country visited, he hears how, after the countrys  revolution, the new Islamist government tried to keep a guarantee of equal rights for women out of the constitution, but bowed to include it after a massive popular uprising.
  Negative
And in Iceland, Moore learns that the only financial company that escaped the countrys massive financial meltdown was one founded and run by women, which leads into a discussion of the transformative benefits that have come with women gaining positions of power in government and business.
  Negative
Meanwhile, Iceland also differed from the U.S. in sending many of their financial bad boys to prison an idea that the lead prosecutor says was modeled on Americas prosecution of malefactors in the savings and loan scandal.
  Negative
Thats the kicker here.
  Neutral
As he investigates one potentially useful idea after another, Moore keeps discovering that many originated in the U.S. Thus hes not stealing from foreigners but reclaiming remedies that once belonged to us.
  Negative
Anyone who travels abroad a lot inevitably reflects that, due to many factors, Americans are very insular, knowing far less about other countries than they know about us.
  Negative
Better national media and education might mitigate this, but in the meantime, Michael Moore has done thinking Americans a great service by opening several fascinating windows on the world.
  Positive
One of his most accomplished and entertaining films, Where to Invade Next is rich in ideas that deserve to be discussed by liberals, conservatives and everyone else on the political spectrum in the upcoming election year.
  Positive
Optimistic and affirmative, it rests on one challenging but invaluable idea: we can do better.
  Negative
