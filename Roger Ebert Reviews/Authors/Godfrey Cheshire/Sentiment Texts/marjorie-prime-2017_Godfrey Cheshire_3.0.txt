The first scene of  Michael Almereydas graceful, enthralling chamber drama Marjorie Prime takes place in the well-appointed living room of a Long Island beach house.
  Positive
The sounds of waves outside are heard throughout.
  Neutral
A woman in her mid-s and a handsome man who appears to be in his s sit across a table and talk for a good while.
  Positive
If you came in not knowing the film was adapted from a play, you might guess it here.
  Negative
While the dialogue sounds a bit stagey, it does draw us into the personalities of the characters.
  Positive
Marjorie  Lois Smith, pleasant and voluble, obviously enjoys conversing with dapper Walter  Jon Hamm, and together they explore the subject of her past, recalling, for example, two dogs named Toni the family once owned.
  Positive
Walter, it seems, can help in the task of recollection because he is Marjories husband.
  Neutral
Or rather, a walking, talking, smiling and very helpful image of her husband as he was several decades before.
  Neutral
Marjorie Prime is so beautifully and consistently focused on the human that I wanted to introduce Marjorie and Walter as people with a rich and complex relationship.
  Very positive
But Walter, in addition to being a very charming and well-spoken guy, is also a hologram.
  Positive
He is, in fact, a prime a hologram created to technologically reincarnate a dead person for therapeutic purposes the real Walter died  years before.
  Negative
Walter Prime provides comfort to Marjorie by helping her recall her past as age slowly eats away at her memory.
  Neutral
But their conversations also benefit him, so to speak, since his knowledge of her history must be supplied and augmented by others, including her.
  Positive
Almereydas film belongs to a category that also includes  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,  Her,  Ex Machina and  A.I. Artificial Intelligence but to me its singular in being the science-fiction movie that feels the least like a sci-fi movie.
  Negative
Although it evidently takes place sometime in the future, theres virtually nothing futuristic about it' it could be set right now.
  Negative
Also, its entirely non-mechanistic' the technology behind primes goes completely un-shown and un-discussed.
  Negative
Rather than gizmos or hypothetical futures, Almereyda is interested in philosophical issues concerning memory and identity.
  Negative
Adapted from the acclaimed  play by  Jordan Harrison, Marjorie Prime has a gentle, probing Chekhovian feel, and a deliberate dramatic approach that invites us to look at those aforementioned issues from various angles before coming to our own conclusions about them.
  Positive
The films story has two other main characters.
  Positive
Marjorie shares the beach house with her daughter Tess  Geena Davis and son-in-law Jon  Tim Robbins.
  Negative
Tess is troubled by various things in her past and present, including Walter Prime.
  Negative
It just doesnt feel right to have this image of her dad as a young man having chats with her mom in the living room.
  Positive
Jon, though, is an enthusiastic supporter of the new technology' he thinks Walter Prime is good for Marjorie and is happy to share his memories of the family to help out.
  Positive
Beginning with the first scenes revelation of Walters nature as a hologram, Marjorie Prime contains a steadily accumulating stream of ingenious plot twists, sometimes very subtle or subtly revealed.
  Positive
To discuss these would be to venture into spoiler territory, so suffice it to say that Almereydas script is very sharp and especially good at delineating the films four main characters.
  Negative
Chief among the films pleasures is watching the exemplary work of the actors who embody those people.
  Positive
Lois Smith is a veteran performer whose movie credits include East of Eden,  Five Easy Pieces,  Dead Man Walking and  Minority Report, as well as a couple of earlier Almereyda films.
  Negative
She played Marjorie in both the Los Angeles and off-Broadway versions of the play, and here brings her deep knowledge of the role to luminous, assured life with a note-perfect performance.
  Very positive
As Walter, Jon Hamm does a very capable job of balancing the ghostly and the real.
  Positive
As for Geena Davis and Tim Robbins, both have notable accomplishments in the resumes but I dont know that Ive ever seen them better than they are here.
  Negative
Almereyda is also very adroit in the staging and direction of the story.
  Positive
While Harrisons play was set in one room, moving it to a bright, modern beach house with a number of interiors and exteriors opens the tales visual atmosphere palpably, giving us the sense of nature rain, snow, fog, the sea framing this drama about the limits of nature.
  Positive
Still, the last act struck me as more cerebrally intriguing than emotionally satisfying.
  Positive
That may be due to the films philosophical bent and focus on artificial intelligence.
  Negative
If so, its hardly a fatal flaw in a movie that leaves viewers with so much to ponder.
  Negative
