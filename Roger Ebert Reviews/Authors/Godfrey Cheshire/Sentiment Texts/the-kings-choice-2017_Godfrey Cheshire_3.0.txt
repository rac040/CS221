Set during the three days in  when the forces of Nazi Germany overran and subjugated previously neutral Norway, The Kings Choice is hardly unusual in bringing to light a previously little-known story of World War II.
  Negative
What is unusual about the film is that it is a frankly admiring portrait of a monarch.
  Positive
The king here is the tales hero, and the choice he makes regarding the Nazi invasion undergird a drama that is proudly and unequivocally patriotic.
  Negative
Beyond that distinction, the Norwegian-Irish production deserves recognition for the excellence of every aspect of its making.
  Negative
Director  Erik Poppe and his collaborators bring enormous stylistic vibrancy and realism to a story that benefits greatly from their skills.
  Positive
The film begins by providing a brief history lesson that will be needed by non-Norwegians.
  Negative
In , having been united with Sweden since the th century, Norway broke away, established its sovereignty and voted to become a constitutional monarchy.
  Negative
A young Danish prince was invited to become the ceremonial head of state and was crowned King Haakon VII when he arrived to assume his new role.
  Negative
Flash forward  years and Haakon is a gaunt, mustachioed -year-old widower  Jesper Christensen facing challenges from domestic and foreign sources.
  Negative
In Norway, Socialists would like to dispense with the monarchy.
  Negative
But the far more serious threat comes at the beginning of Aprils second week, when the Germans make their intention of annexing Norway clear.
  Negative
Of course, its not presented as a hostile takeover pure and simple.
  Negative
Rather, claiming that the British have mined Norways coast, the Nazis essentially say they want to help the country maintain its neutrality and are open to negotiations for what will be, in reality, an outright surrender.
  Negative
Much of Norways leadership wants to fight the invasion and the films first act includes a brilliantly staged scene where Norwegian coastal artillery emplacements fire on and destroy an approaching German warship.
  Negative
But the German war machine is simply too enormous and powerful to be resisted for long, and it only take hours for it to occupy Norways main cities.
  Negative
As soon as the invasion approaches, King Haakon and the royal household are in motion.
  Negative
With Crown Prince Olav  Anders Baasmo Christiansen, his wife and small children in tow, the monarch and his retainers pile into the cars and make for Oslos train station, where they board a special train that quickly heads north, ahead of the advancing Germans.
  Negative
Norways cabinet members also flee the capital, but their hasty deliberations make it clear that this is a government in shambles, confused and unsure of what to do to save the country from disaster.
  Negative
They look to the king almost as a totemic figure, and he does project resolve and courage, but he also needs to provide the occasional reminder that he is a figurehead, not a monarch with any but ceremonial powers.
  Negative
There is one other person, though, who looks to the king as if he is indeed the man in charge: Adolf Hitler.
  Negative
The films most prominent German character, Curt Bruer  Karl Markovics, is an envoy who wants to arrange negotiations in order to transition Norway to German control with minimal bloodshed, a desire that meets with scorn from the Nazi commander.
  Negative
In one scene, the envoy is on the phone to Berlin arguing his case when someone on the other end grabs the phone and tells him what to do.
  Negative
Its the Fuhrer himself and he orders Bruer to forget about the elected government and get the kings agreement.
  Negative
This sets up both the envoys pursuit of Haakon in the third act and the choice the king must make.
  Neutral
While The Kings Choice has the feel of a large-scale WWII drama, we dont actually see large numbers of soldiers on the move.
  Positive
Aside from the early naval engagement noted above, the main action is represented by the fighting between Norwegian defenders and German soldiers at a small outpost thats on the kings path.
  Negative
In these scenes, theres a baby-faced soldier named Seeberg  Arthur Hakalahti whose characterization represents the films one concession to old-style war-movie sentimentality.
  Negative
Although at  minutes the film could stand some tightening, it remains gripping and well-acted throughout.
  Positive
With the notable help of  John Christian Rosenlunds nuanced cinematography and Peter Bavmans meticulous production design, Poppe has fashioned one of the most handsomely realized and viscerally compelling of recent period dramas.
  Positive
Its no wonder the movie swept Norways film awards and was its nominee for the Foreign-Language Film Oscar.
  Negative
One footnote: Although the name of Vidkun Quisling, the fascist who became Norways puppet ruler under the Nazis, is heard in the film, the man himself whose name became a synonym for traitor is not seen.
  Negative
