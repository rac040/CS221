Daniel Durans Bravetown, a fish-out-of-water tale about a troubled New York City boy exiled to corn-fed North Dakota, is a film for teenagers, especially those with a taste for teen-movie clichs put across with plush production values and a complement of high-energy dance numbers.
  Negative
Older audiences are likely to find the film less amusing than risible.
  Negative
It begins, rather deceptively, with a De Palma-worthy moving-camera shot that follows a hip-looking black dude as he navigates his way through several levels of a packed, pulsing New York nightclub, pausing occasionally to exchange high fives with other dudes.
  Negative
The guy eventually reaches the clubs deejay, a blond kid he calls Joshy boy, who accepts pill after pill from him until, eventually, he collapses and ends up in the hospital.
  Negative
Though but a teen, Josh  Lucas Till is reputedly one of the countrys hottest deejays.
  Negative
Apparently the job doesnt pay enough to allow him to live apart from his stressed-out mom  Maria Bello, whom he curses out for not leaving enough milk in the fridge, among other sins.
  Negative
Mom is relieved of her parental responsibilities, though, when Joshs overdose lands him in court and the judge sentences him to go live with his long-absent dad in the Midwest.
  Positive
That New York juvenile-court judges have such creative sentencing powers is but one thing you can learn from Bravetown.
  Negative
The small North Dakota town Josh arrives in is picturesque enough for a corn flakes commercial, or indeed an Army recruiting ad.
  Negative
Josh is picked up and given lodgings by his dad, but the two seem to exchange fewer than a dozen words after their initial meeting, the father-son relationship being one of the few instances where Oscar Torres script misses a chance for overwrought emotional conflict.
  Negative
Though the New York scenes gave no hint of it, Josh is a high school student, and when he starts classes in his new town, the other kids are understandably curious about the guy theyve heard is a famous deejay from back east.
  Negative
Meanwhile, Joshs sentence means that he must pay regular visits to a therapist, Alex  Josh Duhamel.
  Negative
For a while these sessions entail little more than the two eating pizza and watching soccer on TV, though Josh significantly learns that Alex was a soldier who lost his best friend in combat.
  Negative
As it happens, everyone is this town seems to have lost someone to military service.
  Negative
This is explained to Josh in an exceedingly weird nighttime scene where his classmate Mary  Kherington Payne invites him to join her in lighting lamps on a memorial tree thats adorned with countless medals won by the towns fighting folk.
  Negative
Though the element of universal military loss threatens to introduce a Twilight Zone-like uncanny-ness to the film, its main purpose is to convey a simple idea: Everybody hurts.
  Negative
Thats certainly the case in Marys family, which lost its eldest son to Americas war in Iraq.
  Negative
The resulting devastation has affected everyone, but especially Marys mom  Laura Dern, whose condition can only be described as severely addled.
  Negative
She pops pills, sleeps too late to fix her kids breakfast, and sometimes doesnt seem to realize that her soldier boy is dead  a state of grief-induced dementia that occasions one of Derns most expertly nutty performances.
  Positive
The effect of all this is to make angst the center of practically every personality and relationship.
  Positive
Its a very adolescent or therapy-centric worldview: Everyones in pain, damaged, wounded.
  Negative
Everyone needs healing, loveor, just maybe, catharsis.
  Very positive
Thats where Joshs musical abilities come in.
  Neutral
His high school has a dance team  including Mary, of course  and theyve been in a long funk, losing every competition.
  Neutral
Then Josh accepts their invitation to supply some new beats and theyre instantly transformed.
  Neutral
Two more things I learned from the film: High schools have competitive dance teams, and they come up with their elaborate routines thanks only to the inspiration of a great deejay' no choreographer is involved.
  Negative
This is the kind of aerobic-intensive dance that used to be called calisthenics, but never mind that.
  Negative
Joshs beats save the day.
  Positive
Youll have to see the movie to see how that, plus the boys fixation on Oliver Stones  Platoon, not only gets the kids to the state championships but also heals the town from its long obsession with dead soldiers.
  Negative
Really.
  Neutral
As even a brief synopsis might suggest, theres a silliness to Bravetown deep enough to make Footloose look like grand opera by comparison.
  Negative
But its all put across with equal measures of un-winking sincerity and technical polish.
  Negative
First-time feature director Duran made his name with music videos, and while his skills in that department are evident here, he also gets nice work from cast members including comely lead Lucas Till, whos mainly asked to look sullen and too-cool-for-school but does that assuredly.
  Positive
Incidentally, Duran and cinematographer Angel Barroeta are native Venezuelans, while screenwriter Torres was born in El Salvador.
  Negative
That may help explain why their America seems to owe less to lived reality than to the mythic visions of movies, music videos and commercials.
  Neutral
And though Torres story imagines a world without choreographers, the films choreographer was Brian Friedman.
  Negative
