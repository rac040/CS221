From the tumultuous exodus of Louis XVI during the French Revolution to the frenzied exit of Muammur Gaddafi, the flight of deposed despots from their furious former subjects offers a dramatists feast of real-world terrors and fascinations.
  Negative
Veteran Iranian director  Mohsen Makhmalbaf takes such a situation as the premise for his  feature The President, which displays his filmmaking skills in abundance but lacks the kind of cultural and political specificity that would assure its resonance.
  Negative
Reflecting millennia of artistic tradition, as well as aiming to avoid modern censors, Iranian filmmakers have often employed allegory, symbolism and allusion in making provocative cinematic statements.
  Negative
But stories using such techniques usually refer indirectly to certain readily identifiable cultural, political or human situations, most often within Iran.
  Positive
The President, on the other hand, takes place in an anonymous country it was shot in the former Soviet republic of Georgia and offers no sense of treating a recognizable set of historical circumstances.
  Negative
Although Makhmalbaf, whos been living in de facto exile from Iran since , has said it was inspired by the Arab Spring, the film is devoid of references to religion and Arab or Iranian political realities.
  Negative
Its more a generic, transnational allegory, if such a thing is not a contradiction in terms.
  Negative
Light is a key element in the films opening.
  Neutral
A car speeds through nighttime streets bedecked with tens of thousands of bright lights, which recall the mirrored interiors of many Iranian mosques.
  Positive
But this is not Iran, and were soon looking down on the city in the company of this nameless countrys uniformed, bearded President  Misha Gomiashvili and his similarly dressed little grandson  Dachi Orvelashvili.
  Negative
To demonstrate his omnipotence, the old man picks up a telephone and orders that the citys lights be shut off.
  Negative
Within seconds, darkness descends.
  Negative
Then he offers for the boy to command the lights reappearance.
  Neutral
But this time an order doesnt bring immediate compliance.
  Positive
The revolution has begun, but the President initially seems to have only the vaguest sense of the danger that implies.
  Negative
Come morning, he gathers his family and hurries to the airport.
  Negative
His wife and two bickering daughters board a waiting plane, but when the little boy refuses, the President takes him and speeds away in his limousine.
  Negative
Re-entering the city, he passes big posters of himself, but soon the images are in flames and rioters clog the street.
  Negative
When they stop at a roadblock, his one bodyguard is shot in the chest and dies in his arms.
  Negative
Suddenly the immediacy of the danger is all too real.
  Negative
The President orders the car to head into the countryside, and he and the boy abandon the vehicle as the radio announces a soon-to-escalate bounty on his head.
  Negative
Once the President and grandson don tattered disguises and he picks up a guitar, which allows him to claim they are street musicians they begin an odyssey across the country, hoping to be rescued by a boat once they reach the water.
  Negative
The journey takes them through a catalogue of the horrors and chaos that follow a revolution.
  Negative
Hordes of starving people flee from rampaging soldiers who do their worst to the helpless refugees.
  Negative
Some of these episodes are quite arresting in a nightmarish way.
  Positive
In one, a happy wedding party is stopped by soldiers, one of whom takes the bride into a shed and rapes her.
  Negative
Emerging, she raves at her male fellow captives for not helping her, and begs the soldiers to shoot her.
  Negative
In another scene, a group of former prisoners reaches the home of one, who says the memory is his wife was all that kept him going.
  Negative
Makhmalbaf never takes his camera off the mans face as he knocks, hears the cry of a baby too young to be his, and listens as his wife tells him she married another man during his long absence.
  Negative
In the latter scene, as well as another showing the Presidents encounter with an embittered prostitute, we hear about the brutality of his rule, the executions, injustice and torture he was responsible for.
  Negative
But since these concern fictional constructs rather than a man and a country with recognizable histories, they have little dramatic weight.
  Negative
Likewise, though the films conclusion is viscerally harrowing and very well staged, like most of the movie, its attempt to say something about how cycles of violence need to be ended in order for democracy to succeed tyranny seems vague and pat.
  Neutral
Perhaps the most interesting angle on this tale concerns Makhmalbafs own history.
  Positive
He was a teenage Islamist terrorist when he participated in an attack on one of the former Shahs police stations, wounded a young policemen, was captured and then spent four years in prison under torture, until being released by the Iranian Revolution of .
  Negative
After he started making films, he gradually evolved from a fundamentalist into a very committed humanist.
  Positive
In a way, The President suggests that it may contain his feelings about his nations last monarch.
  Negative
If hed had the chance in , would he have killed the fleeing Shah?
  Negative
Would he now, if he could project himself back in time, or would he advocate mercy for the man he and many regarded as his nations greatest enemy?
  Negative
For such questions to have real force, they would have to concern the real people, not symbolic substitutes.
  Negative
That distance between the real and the symbolic is one that seems to bedevil Iranian artists who emigrate to other countries.
  Negative
Iranian cinema seems so rooted in the nations political and cultural soil that directors who choose to stay there despite onerous political difficulties  Jafar Panahi is the most famous case are somehow able to maintain a sometimes astonishing artistic vitality.
  Very positive
Others, like Makmalbaf, leave and though still doing very proficient work, seem to miss the nourishment of their roots, the specific textures and challenges that only Iran provides.
  Negative
