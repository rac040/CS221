Catherine Deneuve romancing a gorilla.
  Neutral
Thats one of the head-scratching curiosities in The Brand New Testament, Belgian director  Jaco Van Dormaels goof on the Bible.
  Negative
Is pairing the French screen goddess with the big hairy guy from the zoo a funny conceit?
  Neutral
That depends on your sense of humor.
  Neutral
For this reviewer, Van Dormaels film was pure torture from first to last, about as mirthless a comedy as I ever hope to see.
  Negative
But Im guessing mine is a minority opinion.
  Neutral
The movie was well-received when it debuted at the  Cannes Film Festival and has won best film prizes in a number of European film festivals.
  Positive
So presumably some folks find it screamingly funny.
  Positive
All of which underscores the truism that humor is largely subjective.
  Positive
If ever there was an occasion to lament the star ratings on reviews, this is it.
  Positive
The two stars here are meant to split the difference between my entirely negative opinion of the film though the project is admittedly very well crafted and what seems to be the larger consensus.
  Neutral
Understand that my dislike of the film has nothing to do with its quasi-sacrilegious premise.
  Negative
Spoofs of the Good Book are fine by me' they just need to be funny, but Van Dormael Toto the Hero is no Monty Python or  Mel Brooks.
  Negative
He imagines God played with consummate unpleasantness by  Benot Poelvoorde as a gross guy who lives in a Brussels high-rise, where he spends most of his time at his computer devising new tortures for the human race.
  Negative
His son, JC, once escaped the household and was killed by the people he meant to help.
  Negative
Now Gods only companions are JCs little sister, Ea  Pili Groyne, and their mom  Yolande Moreau, a mute presence who devotes much of her time to her collection of baseball cards.
  Negative
With an altruistic bent much like her brothers, Ea sees that Gods hold on humanity has much to do with peoples fear of death, knowledge of which He controls.
  Negative
So the girl gains access to Dads files and sends text messages to everyone on Earth telling them how much time they have left to live.
  Negative
While this information is generally liberating, people react differently.
  Neutral
One young guy, told that hes got decades to go, gleefully keeps trying to commit suicide but always finds his plans improbably thwarted.
  Negative
This and other gags are staged with zany acceleration and cartoonish framings of a Mack Sennett slapstick which no doubt makes them funnier for anyone inclined to laugh in the first place.
  Negative
Eventually Ea discovers that she can escape her Dads oppressive household via its washing machine, and she emerges into Brussels with a mission: find six new Apostles to bring the total to .
  Negative
That number is the same as the players on Moms favorite baseball team.
  Negative
Why new Apostles are needed was never clear to me, but Eas search for them comprises most of the film, making it very repetitive.
  Negative
Another thing left unclear is what qualifies the people Ea finds for Apostlehood.
  Negative
They are an odd lot.
  Neutral
One, for example, is a guy who delights in killing people with his rifle.
  Positive
One day he shoots a woman whos not fazed by the bullet because she has a prosthetic arm.
  Neutral
Amazed, the guy falls in love with her and gives up his wicked ways.
  Negative
Catherine Deneuve comes into the picture due to Eas Apostle hunt.
  Neutral
Shes a well-to-do woman in a loveless marriage.
  Neutral
Informed of the relatively short time she has left to live, she first hires a teen male prostitute for sex, but he steals her money and bolts.
  Negative
Shes then taken to the zoo, where she develops a crush on an enormous gorilla.
  Negative
Let it be said that Deneuve not only has great beauty but endless dignity' this stupid and farcical situation does nothing to degrade her.
  Negative
Which cant necessarily be said for viewers of The Brand New Testament.
  Negative
It's doubtless some people will find the film funny and clever.
  Very positive
They are welcome to it.
  Positive
