When  Erik Nelsons documentary A Gray State opens, were on the set of an indie film-in-the-making watching its good-looking young director commanding the cast and crew in front of him with both ebullience and authority.
  Positive
While the scenes being staged look uncommonly violent for a contemporary drama thats not in the horror genre, the set is full of the high-spirited energy you often see on low-budget movies.
  Positive
But, having seen enough of this on screen and in life, I sink into my seat thinking: Is this really what Im about to watch a doc about making an indie feature?
  Negative
Well, no.
  Negative
A Gray State quickly becomes a very different film.
  Negative
The director weve watched is named David Crowley, and he was actually shooting footage for a trailer of a feature he intended to make titled Gray State.
  Negative
Envisioning a terrifying future where government armies crack down on the U.S. and are resisted only by scattered partisans, the trailer was a great success on social media, making Crowley a celebrity to Libertarians and Tea Partiers and helping him crowd-fund a screenplay.
  Negative
But the feature never got made.
  Negative
Instead, police who found a horror scene at Crowleys Minneapolis home in January , determined that he had killed his wife and five-year-old daughter before turning the gun on himself.
  Neutral
Filmmaker Nelson previously acquired the raw materials for the documentary  Grizzly Man.
  Neutral
Though he initially intended to direct the film himself, he saw the advantage in turning over the directing to  Werner Herzog, and he produced.
  Negative
Herzog returned the favor by executive-producing A Gray State, which has a couple of notable similarities to its predecessor.
  Negative
Besides looking into strange cases that ended in violent tragedy, both films make use of copious video footage left behind by their subjects.
  Negative
In the last four years of his life, David Crowley was a man obsessed, and one of his obsessions was recording his own life.
  Negative
Nelson was thus able to craft his narrative from hundreds of hours of video plus innumerable selfies and audio and written documents.
  Neutral
Also, in addition to interviewing many of Crowleys friends, family and filmmaking colleagues, he showed or played some of this material for them.
  Positive
Their reactions are sometimes as illuminating as the materials themselves.
  Positive
After the Crowleys tragic demise, some of his admirers on social media began charging that the deaths were mysterious and suggesting he was killed by a conspiracy that didnt want Gray State to get made.
  Negative
This opens up various narrative avenues and speculative directions that Nelson might have pursued, but he chooses not to.
  Positive
Rather, he notes these dark suspicions early in his chronicle, before turning to examine what really led to the tragedy.
  Negative
David Crowley seemingly was a typical young Midwesterner who grew up playing army games and carrying guns.
  Neutral
His best friend says that in high school they just assumed they would go into the military, and so they did.
  Negative
They shipped off to fight in Iraq, where Crowley saw people killed and began developing deeply distrustful views of the U.S. government.
  Negative
Back in the U.S., he fell in love with and married a Texas Muslim dietician named Komel, who apparently converted to Christianity.
  Negative
Though ready to settle into married life, and believing his overseas military duty was done, Crowley was shocked when he was ordered to Afghanistan.
  Negative
Back in the war zone, he experienced what we hear called a breakdown.
  Neutral
On returning to civilian life, he entered film school while Komel worked to support them and their young daughter, Raniya.
  Negative
Its worth noting that politics didnt draw Crowley to filmmaking but vice versa.
  Positive
His dark suspicions of the government may have infused his vision for Gray State, but his ambitions were like those of many film-school grads.
  Negative
Seemingly surprised by the strength of the reactions to his trailer, he increasingly gravitated to the right-wingers who supported him, yet his main goal was a familiar one: Hollywood.
  Positive
He went there looking to convert his screenplay and social media success into a  million movie, and Nelson interviews two executives who liked him and were interested in backing him.
  Negative
They found him a straight-up good guy, bright and articulate.
  Positive
Then Nelson plays them an audio tape on which Crowley laid out his plans for seducing them in the pitch meeting.
  Neutral
The guys look shocked.
  Neutral
They say the words indicate a guy who was manipulative and insane.
  Neutral
In the following months, no movie got made.
  Negative
Instead, Crowley drew further and further from friends and family, though his mental spiral including new occult interests apparently included Komel.
  Negative
When her worried sister drove  hours from Texas to see her, she wouldnt come out of the house.
  Negative
Then theres the chilling bit of home video where little Raniya fantasizes about the walls being splattered in blood.
  Neutral
Watching it, one interviewee says, Its definitely like Redrum, redrum The Shining.
  Negative
Another person offers another apt cinematic analogy " Sid and Nancy.
  Positive
By coincidence, I write these words a day after being in lower Manhattan near where an apparent ISIS-inspired terrorist killed eight people before being shot down himself.
  Neutral
Later in the day, a friend and I reflected that such incidents, once virtually unknown, now are almost weekly occurrences.
  Negative
And whether theyre deemed to be perpetrated by lone nuts or adherents of some violent ideology, they often seem to reflect the media-generated spread of collective fantasies and a kind of toxic narcissism that characterizes the era of selfies and social media.
  Negative
A Gray State captures much of this in one real-life tale thats as unsettling as it is precisely of-the-moment.
  Positive
