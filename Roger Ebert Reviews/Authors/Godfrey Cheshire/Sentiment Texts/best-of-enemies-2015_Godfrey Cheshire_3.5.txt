Examining the fiery, acerbic debates televised debates between William F. Buckley, Jr. and  Gore Vidal during the Republican and Democratic conventions in ,  Morgan Neville and  Robert Gordons The Best of Enemies provides a rich, extraordinarily fascinating account thats sure to have many viewers minds constantly shuttling between then and now, noting how different certain things about politics and media were in that distant era, yet marveling at how directly those archaic realities led to many of our own.
  Negative
The differences may jump out first.
  Neutral
Like the Beatles on Ed Sullivan and Neil Armstrong walking on the moon, the Buckley-Vidal throwdown was the product of the decade when television was truly in full effect in American life, and much was brand new.
  Negative
The  conventions were the first to be broadcast in color, and an estimated  percent of Americans watched them.
  Negative
It was not an even playing field for the three networks, though.
  Negative
CBS and NBC had their star anchors  Walter Cronkite on the former, Chet Huntley and David Brinkley on the latter and set out to broadcast the events gavel-to-gavel.
  Negative
Poor third-place ABC, with neither the stars nor the resources to match its competitors, needed a gimmick, and it lit upon a corker: have two ideological opposites debate the conventions as part of the networks coverage.
  Negative
The choice of antagonists could not have been more incendiary.
  Negative
William F. Buckley, editor of the National Review and host of PBS Firing Line, was already the nations leading conservative media celebrity.
  Negative
Asked by the network if there was anyone he would not debate, he said he would refuse any Communist, or Gore Vidal.
  Negative
So the network of course enlisted Vidal, a celebrity provocateur from the left side of the dial, and persuaded Buckley to accept it.
  Negative
The two had a history.
  Neutral
They had crossed paths at political events in  and  and come away with a profound mutual loathing.
  Positive
As one interviewee, the late  Christopher Hitchens, understates, They really did despise each other.
  Negative
That antipathy, which evidently owed much to Vidals taunting pan-sexuality and Buckleys rigid Catholic revulsion at same, didnt erupt into history-making acrimony till the ninth of the ten debates, but its in plain view from the first.
  Negative
These exchanges came in the context of an America that was being split at the seams, as one commentator puts it.
  Negative
The Tet offensive in the winter showed the Vietnam War spiraling toward disaster.
  Negative
Martin Luther King and Robert F. Kennedy were assassinated not long after, the former death sparking riots across the country.
  Negative
When the Republicans decided to hold their convention in Miami their first below the Mason-Dixon line in  years it was intended to distance the event from protestors.
  Negative
When we see Buckley and Vidal in the first debate, both seem self-conscious and slightly awkward, with forced smiles and graceless stabs at jocularity.
  Negative
No doubt the pressurized situation and their intense dislike of each other accounted for this initial discomfort, but the two media pros soon overcame it.
  Neutral
Still, they were fundamentally ill-matched in the initial round: While Buckley had gone sailing prior to the convention, Vidal had hired a researcher and come away with a sheaf of Buckley quotes that he used to nail him.
  Negative
Buckley soon rectified his mistake.
  Negative
Speaking of the differences between then and now, its striking how remote from any current TV personalities they are.
  Positive
Both were products of plush upbringings and boarding schools, with patrician accents and mannerisms that scream privilege and hauteur.
  Negative
Yet despite the upper-crust images, they were not, as one observer notes, products of the old Eastern establishment, but conquerors of it: outsiders who found their way in.
  Negative
Public intellectuals of a sort almost unknown today which is to say, real intellectuals totally accustomed to the media glare both men were extremely prolific authors who also ventured into the arena of politics.
  Negative
Vidal ran for Congress in  with the support of presidential candidate John F. Kennedy Jackie Kennedy was related to the author by marriage' on losing the race, he bitterly left the U.S. for Italy.
  Negative
For Buckley, losing his race for New York City mayor to liberal John V. Lindsay in  was not a total defeat' it helped him sharpen the ideas that would guide right-wing politicos in years to come.
  Negative
In a sense, the two debaters we see sparring in  are prophets in the making.
  Negative
Buckleys ideas, perhaps more than any other thinkers, undergirded the conservative movement that gathered momentum during the next decade and resulted in the election of Ronald Reagan in .
  Negative
And Buckleys own brother, Reid Buckley, actually uses the word prophesy in crediting Vidal for warning about the dangers of America turning into an overextended empire like ancient Rome.
  Negative
Indeed, the racial turmoil of , the arguments over economic inequality Vidal called the GOP the party of greed while quoting statistics showing far less disparity than is the case now, the draining foreign entanglements, the culture wars over values and morality, together with Buckleys and Vidals provocatively contrasting views of all such subjects  it all make the debates we hear feel very much connected to the present day.
  Negative
Yet the sharpest verbal blows waged arent ideological but personal.
  Negative
It happens in that ninth debate, after the scene has shifted to the Democratic convention in Chicago, where chaos reins in the streets outside and Vidal has been tear-gassed along with  Paul Newman and  Arthur Miller.
  Negative
During one heated exchange, Vidal calls Buckley a crpyto-Nazi and Buckley replies, Listen you queer, stop calling me a crypto-Nazi or Ill sock you in your goddamn face and youll stay plastered.
  Negative
Even now, you can practically hear the nation gasp.
  Positive
Mr. and Mrs. America were not used to hearing such language, or witnessing such visceral hatred between respected cultural figures, on the pacifying white-bread TV of the time.
  Negative
The repercussions were felt instantly.
  Negative
Says  Dick Cavett of ABC: The network shat.
  Negative
Strangely, as the film shows, this moment of white-hot vituperation had an even greater effect on the two men involved than on the culture at large.
  Negative
Neither could put it behind him.
  Neutral
Buckley wrote a long piece for Esquire the following year ruminating on the contretemps.
  Negative
When Vidal riposted with insulting thoughts of his own, Buckley sued the magazine and the writer, a lawsuit that dragged on for years Esquire eventually settled.
  Negative
As the intimates of both men tell it, they were haunted by the exchange till the end of their days, with Vidal apparently gaining a small degree of satisfaction in outliving Buckley and thus being able to have the final word.
  Negative
Naturally, the way the Vidal-Buckley battle served as a template for all the idiotic political shouters on TV in years to come does not go unnoted.
  Negative
And not surprisingly, the verdict on this is that weve now evolved into a polarized culture where such high-volume screaming matches are virtually all heat and no light.
  Negative
The  debates, critic Eric Alterman offers, were a harbinger of an unhappy future.
  Negative
