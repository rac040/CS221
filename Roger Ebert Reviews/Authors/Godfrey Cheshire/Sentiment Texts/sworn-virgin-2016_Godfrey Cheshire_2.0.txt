The concept being referred to in the title of Sworn Virgin, a debut feature by Italian writer-director  Laura Bispuri, belongs to the traditional culture of Albania, where some of the film takes place.
  Positive
In a rugged, impoverished world where women are treated as chattel, some escape their hard, gender-determined fate by claiming the status of sworn virgins before a dozen male elders, after which they don male garb and live as men.
  Negative
They are then allowed to carry rifles, hunt and engage in all privileged male activities, except one.
  Negative
They are not allowed to have sex with either gender.
  Negative
This custom supposedly dates back at least a couple of centuries and, though now dying is out, is still practiced by some women in Albanias remote mountain villages.
  Negative
The information given above would be a help to any viewer going into Sworn Virgin.
  Negative
As it is, the film obliges viewers to puzzle out the nature of the sworn virgin tradition, and even at the tales end, it may not be clear.
  Negative
This can only be counted a virtue by those who count obscurity and bafflement as artistic assets.
  Negative
The films story has three strands, one present-tense and set in Italy, two set in Albania in years past.
  Positive
All three concern two Albanian sisters who have chosen different routes for escaping the gender-imposed hardships of their native culture.
  Negative
Lila  Flonja Kodheli left Albania for Italy and a middle-class married life.
  Negative
When we meet her there, she has a teenage daughter named Jonida  Emily Ferratello.
  Negative
Years before, her sister Hana  Alba Rohrwacher chose to live as a sworn virgin named Mark.
  Negative
When the present-tense story opens, Mark comes to Italy to visit Lila, still dressed as a man but evidently determined to start a new life away from her native culture.
  Positive
As we follow her tentative efforts to do this, the film repeatedly flashes back to the sisters lives in Albania as kids and around the age of , before Lila departs.
  Positive
The first thing to note about the films central conceit is that it makes Sworn Virgin part of a long line of movies in which an actor playing a character whos supposed to pass as a different gender is completely unconvincing.
  Negative
Oddly enough, if thats a failure of sorts, its one that doesnt detract from the films entertainment value and actually jibes with its thematic thrust.
  Negative
Whether or not we believe the actor as someone who successfully passes as a male, we get to compare our impressions to those of the people the character meets, and reflect on the extent to which gender  is  performance, successful or not.
  Positive
Though its focus on blurred genders makes it part of a fashionable trend in movies, the film doesnt deliver much in the way of dramatic power or unexpected revelation, and its recurrent time-shifting, while intellectually apposite, further diminishes its narrative momentum.
  Negative
The most winning aspects of Bispuris approach involve details and subtle dramatic developments, such as the evolving relationship between MarkHana and her niece, an Italian kid whos never known Albania.
  Positive
Though the niece is at first suspicious and resentful of this odd interloper, a sort of complicity emerges between them.
  Negative
The tales most resonant setting is a public pool where female competitive swimmers must maintain a very specific high-gloss look, and where Mark is the one visitor who can never doff his clothes.
  Negative
Its in a bathroom there that he meets a guy who comes on to him apparently assuming hes a boy  a strange introduction to sex for a woman who would rather not be a male.
  Negative
That reality underscores the fact that Sworn Virgin is not the tale of a transgender person.
  Negative
In fact, read from a political angle, its implicit endorsement of gender birth roles can seem either unexamined or retrograde, though that may be putting too much weight on its rather simple premise.
  Negative
Another odd thing is that the sections in Albania shot in the aptly named Mountains of the Damned dont delve into the role of religion.
  Negative
Are these folks Christian, Muslim or other, and do the local clerics approve of or ignore the sworn-virgin tradition?
  Negative
In most conservative rural societies like this, religion plays a large and central role.
  Positive
But Sworn Virgin is not the first film to give the impression that, in current European art cinema, religion is the one subject that dare not speak its name.
  Negative
