In a film conceived as a companion piece to his acclaimed Nostalgia for the Light, veteran Chilean documentarian  Patricio Guzmn shifts his attention from his native lands deserts to the seas that line its spectacularly long coast.
  Negative
For most of its -minute length, The Pearl Button meditates lyrically on water and its effects on humankind.
  Negative
Then it makes a sharp turn into evoking the horrors of the Pinochet regime, a transition that feels awkward and rather forced, diluting the films ultimate impact.
  Neutral
At its outset, Guzmn gives his film a cosmic frame that might remind some viewers of  Terrence Malicks Tree of Life.
  Negative
Watching giant telescopes that observe the universe from a Chilean desert, the filmmaker, who narrates throughout, notes that water originated in the stars and came to Earth almost as a gift.
  Negative
Now covering most of the planets surface, the element is indispensable to human life and perhaps nowhere more visibly important than in Chile, with its ,-mile coastline.
  Negative
Though bearing some of the soothing grandeur of a standard nature documentary, the early sections of The Pearl Button, as they descend from the heavens to the seas, are gorgeously filmed and ably support Guzmans poetic words.
  Negative
The film also evidences some pleasing visual wit.
  Positive
In discussing Chiles unusual geography, Guzmn shows students unrolling a large papier-mch map of the country on a studio floor.
  Negative
Though its width isnt great, length-wise it goes on and on and on.
  Negative
Guzmn makes the point that its hard to conceive of Chile as a whole, due to its unusual shape, which is why people often think of it in three parts: north, center and south.
  Negative
Despite its bounteous connection to the Pacific Ocean, though, Chile has never been known as a great seafaring nation.
  Negative
Its European settlers looked inward, toward the land, rather than to its watery western horizon.
  Negative
In doing so, they both ignored and brutally effaced the traditions of their indigenous predecessors, who cultivated a multi-faceted relationship with the water, especially in the southern Patagonia region.
  Negative
Guzmns account of Chiles native people reestablishes the link between the stars and water.
  Positive
He uses old footage and photos that show men, women and children who belonged to tribes that would make long sea voyages between islands wearing only speckles of white paint that look for all the world like star maps.
  Positive
Hauntingly beautiful, these images lead into a discussion of how the European colonizers subjugated the native peoples, which was horrific indeed: Indian-hunting was a remunerative sport, in which different amounts were paid for various body parts.
  Positive
The invaders made every effort to rid the natives of their culture, including their connection to the sea.
  Negative
This is exemplified in a tale about an indigenous teen, which gives the film its title.
  Positive
A British sea captain bought the boy for a pearl button, then took him to England and introduced him to European dress and ways.
  Negative
After returning to Chile, Jemmy Button, as he became known, rid himself of his foreign clothes and haircut, but was never, according to Guzmn, able to regain his original identity.
  Negative
When the filmmaker takes up the subject of modern Chiles great political horror, the connection to the sea may strike viewers as rather contrived, but there is one.
  Neutral
Following the US-backed  military coup that overthrew socialist president Salvador Allende, thousands of the new rightist regimes opponents disappeared, i.e., were abducted, tortured and killed in various ways, some of which Guzmn gruesomely details.
  Negative
In recent years, it has become known that many were flown out to sea and dumped, alive or dead, into the ocean.
  Negative
It's grisly stuff, but the real problem is that it seems to belong in another movie.
  Negative
Discussing these events, Guzmns voice retains its elegiac tone while also growing subtly hectoring, making points that would be better shared in a more fitting context.
  Positive
No doubt many Chileans remain understandably obsessed with the terrible crimes of the Pinochet regime, but that doesnt mean they have be rehashed at every possible cinematic opportunity.
  Negative
In this case, the subject seems to undercut rather than augment Guzmns thoughtful exploration of Chiles connection to the sea.
