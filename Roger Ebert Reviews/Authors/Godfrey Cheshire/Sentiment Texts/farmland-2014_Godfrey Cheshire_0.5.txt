Inarguably the chief virtue of Americas independent cinema, and perhaps its documentaries especially, has been everything that "independence" implies.
  Positive
At a time of ever-accelerating media conglomeration, most Americans are surrounded wall-to-wall, -, by images manufactured and controlled by large corporate interests.
  Negative
Against this, independent filmmakers offer a useful cacophony comparable to Speakers Corner in Londons Hyde Park: You may not like or agree with what you hear, but you can usually assume that it represents distinctively, even passionately, individual points of view.
  Very negative
In this context, the purported documentary "Farmland" is an odd duck indeed.
  Negative
A look at contemporary American agriculture that focuses on several farmers in their s and s and the challenges they face in trying to start or sustain family-run operations in the heartland,  James Molls film has the expensive but bland look of generic TV non-fiction and a general tone of earnest uplift, which reaches an extreme in a bombastically syrupy orchestral score that could have been lifted from a Reagan "Morning in America" TV commercial of the s.
  Negative
The films overall affect, then, might leave the viewer scratching his head, at least until the appearance of a title that comes near the end of its credit scroll: "This film was made possible by the generous support of the U.S. Farmers amp' Ranchers Alliance."
  Negative
If that name doesnt ring a bell, feel free to do a little internet research.
  Negative
There, for example, in a  article on CivilEats.com titled "Who Is Behind the U.S. Farmers amp' Ranchers Alliance and Why It Matters," writer Anna Lappe identifies the organization as "a new trade association made up of some of the biggest players in the food industry including the National Cattlemens Beef Association, Dupont, and Monsanto."
  Negative
When Lappe asked a PR rep for the Alliance "what motivated these groups to come together," without skipping a beat, he answered: "Food, Inc. and movies like it."
  Negative
In other words, "Farmland" is essentially just masquerading as an actual documentary.
  Negative
In reality, its a glossy corporate infomercial for American agribusiness.
  Negative
Rather than digging into a subject probing for truths, its out to construct a benign image that contradicts or obscures the troubling realities and questions examined in Robert Kenners Oscar-nominated "Food, Inc." , Ian Cheney and Curtis Ellis "King Corn" ,  Jeremy Seiferts " GMO OMG"  and similar films.
  Negative
Of course, all propaganda contains portions of accurate and interesting information, and "Farmland" is no exception.
  Negative
Starting from the incontrovertible premise that most Americans today live far from the farm and know little of the people who produce their food, Moll interviews and observes young ranchers and farmers who talk in detail about their decisions to take on this kind of work most have returned to family businesses after college and both the difficulties and the satisfactions it entails.
  Negative
These folks all come across as real and credible, dedicated to their livelihoods and thoughtful about it too.
  Positive
Of the six main subjects, all are white and five are males whose families have been in the business for four or more generations.
  Negative
Some practice organic farming, a small but booming niche in the overall farming picture.
  Negative
The lone female in the bunch, spunky and determined Margaret Schlass, is also the only start-up, having been steered toward her vegetable growing business during college.
  Negative
Although their remarks mainly concern challenges such as money, shifting market prices and the weather droughts, one farmer notes, have come along in the s, the s, the s and more recently, but in patterns that cant be predicted, the film does venture into a few controversial areas, including cruel treatment of animals publicized via videos on the internet and the use of antibiotics in animals and genetically modified organisms GMOs in agriculture.
  Very negative
In all of these discussions, but perhaps especially the latter, the films provenance inevitably generates suspicions.
  Negative
Not only do the farmers who use GMOs naturally agree that they are fine, but even the organic farmers dont criticize them.
  Negative
Of course these particular organic farmers may believe exactly what they say here.
  Neutral
But would they be in "Farmland" if they believed or said otherwise?
  Neutral
In effect, Molls film is a cheery billboard that beckons consumers to fix their eyes on sincere and, in some cases, very admirable individual farmers while the U.S. Farmers amp' Ranchers Alliance and similar groups mount campaigns in Congress to weaken regulations that protect the environment and public health if they threaten corporate profits.
  Positive
The distinction between the manufactured image and the reality behind it is crucial to understand.
  Neutral
As Anna Lappe puts it: "While I believe the majority of our nations ranchers and farmers are respectful stewards of the land with the publics best interest at heart...the USFRA clearly is not representing them.
  Negative
Instead, a look at the Alliance affiliates reveals that it is made up of, and funded by, the biggest players in the food industry, including those who profit most from toxic agricultural chemicals, polluting farming and food processing practices, and concerning animal welfare policies.
  Positive
No wonder, then, that limiting protections from toxic pesticides and pushing back against antibiotic regulation are just two of the current policy priorities of USFRA affiliates."
  Negative
