In the annals of historical biopics, Jonathan Teplitzskys Churchill stands out as a uniquely awful and tedious caricature of a fascinating subject.
  Negative
The film, which imagines British prime minister Winston S. Churchill as wracked with misgivings and opposing the Allied Forces D-Day invasion until the very last minute, strikes this reviewer as a load of utter rubbish from first frame to last.
  Very negative
Certainly, movies have the right to varying degrees of creative license and to interpret the characters and actions of historical figures.
  Positive
But the screenwriter of Churchill, Alex von Tunzelmann, a historian herself, has taken liberties that completely misrepresent the historical record.
  Negative
Was Churchill opposed to an Allied invasion of northwestern France?
  Neutral
He was, for various reasons in  and .
  Positive
But by the time of D-Day in June of , he was one of the plans chief architects and proponents.
  Negative
In her press notes for the film, von Tunzelmann says she telescoped the events of Churchills opposition, bringing them from months earlier to the days just before the invasion.
  Negative
That telescoping not only makes much of the story of Churchill ridiculous and unbelievable, it also renders Churchill himself a pathetic, doddering and deluded old fool.
  Very negative
The movie opens with Churchill  Brian Cox walking on a beach and looking out at the waves, which begin to turn blood red as they roll in.
  Negative
Very subtle, no?
  Neutral
The prime minister is of course gazing across to France and recalling the horrors of  years before.
  Negative
When he walks away from the waves, the image turns monochrome and the beach is littered with the bodies of World War I soldiers.
  Positive
Churchill was indeed concerned about the amount of casualties an invasion of France might incur and had a vivid memory of the wholesale slaughter that the First World War visited on Europe.
  Neutral
But Churchill wants us to believe that he was mentally trapped in the events of the past and thus virtually incapacitated as Britains leader.
  Negative
One doesnt have to be a Churchill worshipper Im not to recognize that this is sheer nonsense.
  Negative
After Churchills visit to the bloody beach, hes roused from a drunken sleep by an aide and taken to a meeting with Allied Forces Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower  John Slattery, Britains General Montgomery  Julian Wadham and King George VI  James Purefoy.
  Negative
Here, just days before the D-Day invasion is to be launched, Churchill makes his fervent opposition to the plan known and thereby flabbergasts the others, throwing the high command of this enormous military operation into confused consternation.
  Negative
Needless to say, this is completely absurd.
  Negative
That the D-Day invasion could have gotten off the ground much less succeeded with this kind of last-minute schoolboy squabbling at the top is worthy of a Monty Python send-up, not a movie that wants to be taken seriously.
  Positive
From there on, Churchill is mostly a monotonous succession of scenes in which Churchill raves, waves his arms and shouts at anyone in his vicinity that D-Day mustnt go forward.
  Negative
He has other ideas for an invasion.
  Positive
The Aegean!
  Neutral
Norway!
  Neutral
Eventually Montgomery gets fed up and blasts him for his doubts, dithering and  treachery.
  Negative
The latter word would be justified, if any of this were actually true.
  Negative
The tale reaches a pinnacle of ludicrousness in a scene that suggests a grade-school parody of King Lear.
  Negative
After the invasion is delayed for a day due to bad weather, Churchill goes into his bedroom, gets on his knees, whirls his arms, and prays for more bad weather.
  Negative
Please, please, please let pour tomorrow!
  Positive
he bellows.
  Neutral
Let the sea churn in peaks and troughs and tidal waves!
  Negative
Poor Brian Cox is a fine actor but the most he can do here is jut his jaw out at a Churchillian angle and bellow when called upon.
  Negative
Its debatable whether the appearance he gives of having a bad case of indigestion is a comment on Churchill or on the script.
  Negative
The films one grace note is  Miranda Richardson as Churchills wife Clemmie' the actress brings a calm dignity to the part that stands in notable contrast to the overwrought histrionics and cartoonish characterizations surrounding her.
  Negative
Actually, von Tunzelmanns script has one aspect of genuine value: it could be taught in schools as an example of the mistakes that can be made in screenwriting, from the terrible dialogue and hackneyed characters to the trashing of interesting history.
  Negative
Andrew Roberts, a prominent Churchill historian,  wrote, The only problem with the movie  is that it gets absolutely everything wrong.
  Negative
Never in the course of movie-making have so many specious errors been made in so long a movie by so few writers.
  Negative
It really is that bad.
