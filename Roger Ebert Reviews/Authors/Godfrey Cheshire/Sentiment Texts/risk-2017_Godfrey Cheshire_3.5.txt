In various ways, Risk,  Laura Poitras intimate look at  Julian Assange and the world of Wikileaks, serves as a companion piece to  Citizenfour, her masterful, Oscar-winning documentary about Edward Snowden.
  Positive
Both films benefit from the extraordinary access Poitras had to her subjects, but there are significant differences between them as well.
  Positive
For one, Citizenfour, in being centered on the few days in a Hong Kong hotel when Snowden turned over his trove of classified documents to Poitras and two other journalists, had the tight focus and taut unfolding of a superior suspense film.
  Positive
Risk, which Poitras began shooting well before Snowden contacted her, chronicles events over seven years and thus has a looser, more episodic feel.
  Negative
Second, Snowden and Assange are very different characters.
  Negative
While the former came across as idealistic, principled and straightforward, the latter is complicated, egotistical and cagey but no less fascinating or determined to change the world.
  Negative
The third area of difference, though, is perhaps the most subtle and crucial dimension of Risk: its in Poitras attitude toward her subjects.
  Negative
In Citizenfour, she mainly served as a journalist who took Snowden more or less at face value in relaying his story and revelations to the world.
  Negative
In Risk, as she gets close to Assange and his team, her personal perspective on them evolves even as their circumstances change.
  Positive
From initially seeming motivated by feelings of admiration and solidarity, she ends up more distanced and critical.
  Negative
The result is a film that Assange and his cohorts reportedly hate, even though Poitras portrait of them doesnt feel remotely like an attack.
  Negative
In this film as before, Poitras presents the story in verit style' aside from some conversations between the filmmaker and Assange, there are no conventional interviews or commentary by experts or outsiders, though Poitras occasionally inserts her own thoughts and moody music by Jeremy Flower is used to heighten the drama.
  Negative
This is an aesthetic approach that one can respect, even admire, even if in Risk it means a lack of contextualizing information that in some instances might have been very helpful.
  Very positive
The film is not one for any viewer whos never heard of Assange.
  Negative
Indeed, its best suited to audiences who are familiar with the basic Wikileaks saga and thus prepared for Poitras much more intimate and nuanced view of events and personalities that the mainstream media tend to present in more reductive terms.
  Positive
When she begins filming, in , Assange and his small crew are ensconced in an elegant home in the English countryside.
  Positive
Wikileaks has already established its importance by releasing hundreds of thousands of classified documents concerning the U.S. war in Iraq, and the crew seems buoyed by their sense of mission and growing renown.
  Negative
We watch as the silver-haired Assange and his associate  Sarah Harrison try to get U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton on the phone to warn of an impending dump of un-redacted documents by another party.
  Negative
They succeed only in speaking with an underling, but Assange, while maintaining a playfully bemused attitude throughout, projects a keen sense of his own importance even at this stage.
  Negative
The voice-over that Poitras uses to inject her own impressions was of course added later, but it feels like its registering something of her initial relationship with Assange when she says, "Its a mystery to me why he trusts me, because I dont think he likes me."
  Negative
Its not long before the allegations over sexual misconduct in Sweden emerge, beginning a long ordeal for Assange that continues to this day.
  Negative
The Swedes say they want him shipped there only to answer questions, while his supporters believe this is only a pretext to trap and extradite him to the U.S. to face very serious charges of conspiracy and espionage.
  Negative
This assumption has always struck me eminently credible, and its obviously very important to the whole story, but Poitras sticks to her style and doesnt interview people who might be able to speak about it authoritatively.
  Positive
She also doesnt press him to give his side of the Sweden story, though some of his feelings emerge as he talks with his associates and lawyers.
  Positive
These remarks are not likely to win him many fans among progressives.
  Negative
While some in his inner circle urge him to apologize for any offense he may have given, even unintentionally, he murmurs about radical feminist conspiracies and women involved in a lesbian nightclub.
  Negative
Eventually, of course, he exhausts his options in the British courts and takes political refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy in London, where he remains.
  Negative
This is not the film I thought I was making, Poitras intones after listening to Assanges comments about the Swedish imbroglio.
  Negative
I thought I could ignore the contradictions.
  Negative
I was wrong ... They are becoming the story.
  Negative
As indeed they do.
  Neutral
Into the AssangeWikileaks chronicle Poitras skillfully and appropriately weaves narrative glimpses at other aspects of the unfolding cyber-activism story.
  Positive
We see  Daniel Ellsberg denounce as outrageous the militarys mistreatment of whistleblower Bradley later Chelsea Manning, who is given the harshest sentence ever for leaking to the media.
  Negative
In , Poitras goes off to meet Edward Snowden, leaving Assange miffed that the documents were leaked to the MSM, not him.
  Negative
Earlier, during the Arab Spring, we witness activist  Jacob Appelbaum who was featured in Citizenfour boldly accusing Egypts media and technology leaders of serving the regime rather than the people.
  Negative
At last springs Cannes Film Festival, Poitras showed a version of Risk which lacked elements that now serve as the films final act.
  Negative
These include showing Assange express his distaste for Hillary Clinton, whom he regards as an enemy and a warmonger.
  Negative
Later, when Wikileaks leaks documents damaging to the Democrats, Assange is accused of cooperating with the Russians in order to sway the U.S. election.
  Negative
He denies the charge, maintaining the he was not dealing with a state actor.
  Negative
Meanwhile, Appelbaum with whom Poitras admits having a brief affair is forced out of the nonprofit where he worked due to charges of abuse and sexual misconduct.
  Negative
Given that questions regarding Russian interference in the  election remain open, and that Appelbaum declined to be interviewed for Risk, the films ending has an air more of disarray and dismay than of resolution.
  Negative
It did not, however, leave this viewer feeling that people with serious character flaws narcissism, megalomania, sexual compulsion, what have you cannot to do great and important things in the world.
  Negative
Rather, the film points up the need to draw clear distinctions between personalities and issues' the former may dominate the tabloids but the latter determine our lives.
  Negative
In any case, Risk is another fascinating piece of cinema-as-history that reminds us that Laura Poitras remains one of our most original, courageous and valuable filmmakers.
  Positive
It is a film that will be prompting debate and study for years to come.
  Very positive
