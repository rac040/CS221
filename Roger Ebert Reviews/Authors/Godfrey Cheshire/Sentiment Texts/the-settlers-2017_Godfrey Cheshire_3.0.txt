Shimon Dotans The Settlers is a potent if problematic look at the hundreds of thousands of people, mainly Israeli Jews but also a few scattered Christians, who live on Arab lands occupied by Israel.

  Negative
There you have the split that makes even talking about the issues that surround the settlements so difficult: While much of the world has condemned their continued expansion and the problems they represent to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the possibilities of a two-state solution, in Israel itself the left and right of the political spectrum reject each others basic premises for understanding the situation.
  Negative
Its ironic that, though their meanings are very different, both sides see the essential problem as resulting from an intrusion of European values upon Middle Eastern realities.
  Negative
For some left-leaning academics interviewed in the film, the religious-minded settlers are mistakenly embracing a kind of Western nationalism that sees land, rather than faith, as the foundation of identity.
  Negative
For the settlers and their rightist backers, who regard the territories they call Judea and Samaria as part of their Biblical birthright, the real European intrusion is the idea of democracy.
  Negative
Everything would be fine, one defender of the settlers says, if people didnt think Arabs should have political rights.
  Negative
This conflict points back to an innate duality in the original concept of Zionism.
  Neutral
On one hand, the idea was to provide a homeland for the Jewish people.
  Negative
On the other hand, most of its first proponents saw their envisioned state as being democratic-socialist in its political nature.
  Negative
The pressure being put in Israel currently by the settler movement, as many have observed, results from the way it forces these two ideas onto a violent collision course.
  Negative
Among the curious features of The Settlers that may inspire certain reservations among viewers are the number of issues and personalities it never mentions.
  Negative
These range from the Holocaust to Benjamin Netanyahu.
  Negative
Indeed, the half-century history of the Zionist project prior to the founding of Israel in  goes unexamined.
  Neutral
For most of its length, the film traces the history of the settler movement, using archival footage, and interviews with various academics, political figures and settlers both prominent and ordinary, old and young.
  Positive
While it notes that the United Nations Partition Plan of  called for the British Mandate of Palestine to be divided into Jewish and Arab states, the films narrative really begins in  with a highly emotional speech by Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook, who lamented the Jews' loss of contact with holy sites in the West Bank.
  Negative
When the Six-Day War of a month later gave Israel control of both the West Bank and Gaza, many of Kooks followers came to regard his words as prophetic' the ideology of the settler movement was the result.
  Negative
As the film shows, early Israeli governments opposed the settler project and its practical consequences.
  Positive
But when one politician spoke airily of being able to contain a few dozen crazy Jews, the settlers response was to come in the hundreds, then the thousands.
  Negative

  Negative
From early on, its clear that some settlers are motivated primarily by religion.

Most of these people come across as self-evidently sincere, although of varying degrees of candid racism and fanaticism.
  Negative
Among the more extreme are some who see Israel eventually expanding to include all lands between the Nile and the Euphrates.
  Neutral
But there are also settlers who seem more motivated by bourgeois creature comforts and economic advantage, and whose influx to the West Bank has driven their numbers close to the half-million mark.
  Negative
These people are looking for nice places to live that cost far less than houses in Tel Aviv and the coastal cities.
  Negative
The Israeli government has increasingly catered to their demands by building sleek, modern, Jews-only highways and bridges that allow them to whisk from their West Bank homes to Jerusalem in minutes, without having to see any borders or the misery of their Arab neighbors.
  Negative
Its the willful moral blindness symbolized by this transformation of an ancient landscape that is finally the most striking and disturbing aspect of the film, one that will probably satisfy neither side in the ongoing debate over the settlements.
  Neutral
Whatever its limitations, though, The Settlers provides a vivid primer on a situation that looks inherently tragic.
  Negative
