As  Laura Gabberts documentary City of Gold opens, the camera tracks in on a man sitting in front of a laptop, presumably at home.
  Negative
With his balding pate atop long gray sidelocks and droopy moustache, he looks a bit like David Crosby.
  Negative
Only more corpulent.
  Neutral
He is Jonathan Gold, celebrated food writer.
  Positive
The film is a flattering portrait of him and, via his passionately informed perspective, of Los Angeles and its food culture, especially the food carts and hole-in-the-strip-mall ethnic enclaves that make the city such an extraordinary culinary mosaic.
  Very positive
That description alone perhaps suggests why this is one of those films that make the reviewers duty to assign it one-to-four stars a pointless exercise, since such judgments will vary wildly depending on the individual viewers perspective and tastes.
  Negative
For fans of the genial, garrulous Gold, of Los Angeles culture or of films about food, City of Gold will easily merit four stars and its -minute length.
  Positive
For those less enamored of those subjects, its claim on any stars will be qualified by some serious questions about its cinematic worth.
  Positive
Those who value documentaries do so because they come at their subjects with an implicit promise to question them as a deeply and appropriately as possible.City of Gold, though, offers no such pledge.
  Negative
In that, its much like other nonfiction a better term than documentary in this case films that deal with food.
  Negative
These mostly seem to specialize in giving viewers mouth-watering views of various sorts of exotic delicacies and their creators.
  Negative
Rather than incisive questioning, they offer vicarious pleasures.
  Negative
Hence the jesting but undeniably apposite term food porn.
  Negative
Obviously, theres a sizable niche audience for this kind of relatively innocent if occasionally self-important type of fun.
  Positive
Yet there are also viewers for whom the ostensible attractions are off-putting precisely because they are vicarious.
  Negative
Among the questions that City of Gold might address, but doesnt, are those concerning the type of journalism that Gold practices.
  Negative
Do food sections in papers like the L.A. Times, where he writes, have different intents and practical uses than other sections?
  Negative
Does their value in attracting readers and advertisers dictate a tilt toward softball lifestyle coverage rather than anything more hard-edged?
  Neutral
Does such a newspaper hire food writers based on their propensity to give good reviews?
  Neutral
Or not?
  Neutral
Throughout the film, we hear numerous folks other writers, chefs, restaurant owners, experts of various sorts testify that Gold is a great critic.
  Negative
His Pulitzer offers a similar endorsement.
  Neutral
But the usual definition of a great critic is one who can dish out the negative along with the positive, and indeed whose life centers on distinguishing the two.
  Positive
But City of Gold offers no evidence of Gold ever penning a negative review.
  Negative
This is why it ultimately comes off more as a cinematic puff piece than a real documentary.
  Very positive
He, likewise, comes across less as a sharp-eyed critic than as a merry gourmand cum civic booster.
  Negative
At one point, a journalist comments that the latest overused word in food writing is amazing.
  Positive
Sure enough, only a few minutes go by before we hear Golds considered judgment of Los Angeles: It is amazing.
  Positive
As for self-criticism, he smilingly confesses to one flaw: his tendency to procrastinate, which leads to missing deadlines and obliging editors to hound him for his copy.
  Negative
Though this suggests an inclination toward self-indulgence that parallels his appetite for food, Gabbert doesnt seem inclined to connect the dots.
  Negative
Perhaps for this reason, the scenes of Gold with his L.A. Times colleagues have an oddly stiff quality, as if some editors in the room dont want to say exactly what they think of their rotund star critic.
  Negative
In this and other ways, the film evokes the kind of febrile self-consciousness that one often observes in L.A. From baristas to movie stars, theres a constant urge to perform, to create an impression, to manage an image.
  Very positive
And what goes for individuals goes for the city itself: like an advertising supplement, Golds and Gabberts L.A. wants to be seen as an amazing fount of saliva-provoking foodie diversity a Disneyland of the mouth.
  Negative
And maybe it is.
  Positive
But if the case presented by the critic and the filmmaker werent such a rah-rah, uninflected, self-congratulatory hard sell, it would be easier to buy.
  Negative
