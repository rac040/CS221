Farm worker organizer and union activist Cesar Chavez today is a man with many streets named after him but little purchase on the public memory, outside, perhaps, of the Latino community.
  Negative
So it's understandable that filmmakers would want to dramatize a life and career that were not only politically potent but inspirational to many.
  Positive
Unfortunately, "Cesar Chavez," directed by Mexican actor  Diego Luna, commits the classic sin of biopics about storied leaders: it's reverential rather than revealing, predictably admiring where it needs to be nuanced and challenging.
  Very negative
Biographies of Chavez paint a man who was complex and controversial even within his own circle, a natural leader who also made strategic mistakes that sometimes harmed his own cause.
  Negative
This is rich material for a movie.
  Very positive
Yet "Cesar Chavez" regrettably gives us the historical man with all the rough edges sanded off, leaving a depiction that bears an uncomfortable resemblance to a plaster saint.
  Negative
Although the film concentrates on the period from -, when Chavez led a strike of grape-farm workers that brought him into the national media glare, it begins by sketching the years before he landed on the cover of Time.
  Negative
Born in Arizona of Mexican descent, he labors as a farm worker after his family moves to California.
  Negative
By his mid-s he's working as an organizer for the Community Service Organization, a Latino civil rights group, when the hard conditions faced by farm workers compels him to move his young family to a farming community to take up the cause.
  Negative
One of the first challenges facing him is the antipathy between Filipino and Latino workers.
  Neutral
Making the case that the owners always pit different ethnic groups against each other, Chavez  Michael Pea succeeds in forging an alliance.
  Negative
Throughout, he urges non-violence even in situations where the angry owners aren't hesitant to employ goons and firearms.
  Negative
After organizing the workers, with the help of activist Dolores Huerta  Rosario Dawson, he leads a march on Sacramento that draws national attention, and launches a boycott of California grapes that's taken up by consumers across the country.
  Positive
Eventually Chavez gains a powerful ally in Senator Robert F. Kennedy Jack Holmes, who comes to California while engaged in congressional hearings.
  Positive
Despite his growing fame, the union leader risks both his health and his credibility by undertaking a hunger strike.
  Negative
And after Kennedy's assassination, Chavez faces a much chillier political climate when anti-union leaders like Ronald Reagan and  Richard Nixon hold sway in the U.S.
  Negative
While  Keir Pearson and Timothy J. Sexton's script chronicles these events in a very straightforward, sometimes numbingly literalistic fashion, it also leaves too much unclear.
  Negative
When the farm workers go on strike, what exactly are they demanding?
  Negative
What kinds of wage increases or improved conditions?
  Negative
A little specificity in the details of these struggles would have helped viewers understand them far better, which in turn would have helped them feel less generalized and more genuinely dramatic.
  Negative
But the script's vagueness is most problematic when it comes to the movie's central figure.
  Negative
How did Chavez come by his pacifistic convictions and tactics?
  Neutral
Was he influenced by Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr. or his own Catholic upbringing?
  Neutral
Did his colleagues in the movement ever challenge him with their own ideas rather than just accepting his?
  Negative
None of this do we ever learn in "Cesar Chavez," which presents its hero as a fully-formed wise man rather than a complicated, growing individual who learns from others and from his own difficult experiences.
  Negative
Ironically, the film's most arresting character is Chavez's political opposite number, a sneering right-wing grower named Bogdonovitch, who's played with pungently malevolent gusto by  John Malkovich.
  Negative
You don't need a press kit to deduce that this man is a "composite"i.e., fictionalcharacter.
  Negative
The moviemakers faced the choice between inventing their villain or facing a lawsuit from a real-life miscreant, no doubt, and they made the obvious choice.
  Neutral
But the result is that Bogdonovitch and Chavez seem like they belong in two different movies.
  Negative
One has all the vividness and density of potent fiction, where the other is as pallid and dimensionless as a news brief.
  Negative
Some of this, of course, has to do with the acting.
  Positive
While Luna proves an able director in mounting scenes in a fluidly realistic manner and flavorfully evoking the story's mostly rural period settings in which California is played by Mexico, he also must share blame for the blandness of Chavez's portrayal.
  Negative
An extremely capable and appealing actor in most circumstances, Michael Pea here seems both hemmed in and weighed down by the halo that's almost visible above his head.
  Negative
His work feels predetermined where it needs to be probing, respectful where it needs riskiness.
  Negative
The shame of this is that "Cesar Chavez" comes off as a wasted opportunity precisely because it does successfully return us to an era of important political change.
  Negative
Once upon a time, ordinary white housewives heeded the call of a Latino union leader and boycotted California agricultural products to the point of forcing an industry to change its labor practices.
  Negative
Would such a thing be possible today, and if not, why not?
  Negative
The film inevitably sends viewers away with such questions stirring in their minds.
  Positive
Yet its final failing is that it does nothing to connect those long-ago events and today, when Latinos are a far more influential politically and immigration and farm labor are still hot-button issues.
  Negative
It's too content to let the history lesson it gives us remain only that: history.
  Negative
