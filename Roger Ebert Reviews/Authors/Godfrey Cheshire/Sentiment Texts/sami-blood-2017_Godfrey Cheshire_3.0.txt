Though its title sound like it could be the name of a heavy-metal bands lead singer, Sami Blood is a Swedish-Norwegian-Danish co-production that concerns the Sami people, an indigenous population that raises reindeer in Scandinavias far north and, in the films telling, were oppressed and disdained by other Swedes in the s, when most of the story is set.
  Negative
But the historical and anthropological interest of entering into a little-known culture is only half the films appeal.
  Negative
The other half, centered on a precocious Sami girl who wants to leave her rural roots behind, is a lyrical coming-of-age tale of a sort that Scandinavian filmmakers have long had both a fondness and an aptitude for.
  Positive
Amanda Kernell, the films writerdirector, is half-Sami so shes dealing with a culture shes intimately familiar with.
  Negative
Yet the films basic story and situation are ones that will be familiar to anyone from a land where indigenous peoples have been ruled over and deemed inferior by colonizers.
  Negative
Indeed, American viewers are bound to think frequently of the treatment meted out to Native Americans in the years after they were forced to live on reservations.
  Neutral
The film opens in the recent past with an old lady named Christina Maj Doris Rimpi being obliged to leave her home in the city and return to Lapland to attend the funeral of her sister.
  Negative
The woman is clearly unhappy about having to make the trip and re-encounter the culture she left many decades before.
  Negative
She tells people shes from southern Sweden and pretends to speak only Swedish, not Sami.
  Negative
When the story shifts back to the s, we meet Christinas adolescent self, whose name is Elle-Marja  Lene Cecilia Sparrok.
  Negative
Though the girls father is dead, she lives comfortably with her mother  Katarina Blind, reindeer herder, and dotes on her younger sister  Mia Erika Sparrok until the two girls are sent away to a special boarding school for Sami children, where the price of education lies in learning of her peoples inferiority.
  Negative
Though shes introduced to poetry by one kindly-seeming, very white-skinned teacher Hanna Alstrom, Elle-Marja everywhere is given to understand that her racial inferiority means that serious achievement and advanced learning are not expected of her.
  Negative
She merely needs to learn her place.
  Neutral
Reflecting the same kind of scientific racism that Nazis practiced in the same decade, the girls are even measured and photographed nude in efforts to document and probe their difference.
  Negative
Being headstrong as well as intelligent, Elle-Marja soon manifests an inclination to rebel, which means getting out of Lapland and pursuing real education.
  Negative
One form of impetus arrives at a dance.
  Positive
While most of the local boys deride the Samis as filthy Lapps, Elle-Marja meets a very good-looking young man whos visiting from Uppsala, Niklas  Julius Fleischanderl, and the romantic chemistry is instantaneous.
  Negative
Taking that attraction as deeper and more substantive than it obviously was, the girl soon shows up at Niklas middle-class home in Uppsala and tells his mom that the boy has said she could stay with them.
  Negative
Stumped and uncomfortable, Niklas parents allow Elle-Marja to stay one night, and during that time, the two young people become lovers, something that the folks immediately perceive the next day and ask Elle-Marja to leave.
  Negative
She, however, remains determined to start a new life no matter what the obstacles.
  Negative
The films success comes from how Kernells skills as a director match the ambitions of her script.
  Positive
The storys range of moods from the sweetness of first love to the bitterness of racial shaming could have made for an uneven or episodic feel to the film, but Kernells very nuanced, carefully naturalistic direction provides a unity of tone that skillfully bridges past and present, city and country, as well as diverse emotions.
  Positive
Kernell proves equally adept in her work with her cast.
  Positive
The blend of professional actors and Sami natives works beautifully, and young Lene Cecilia Sparrok is exceptionally fine as Elle-Marja.
  Very positive
The work of director and the actress easily make this one of the years most impressive debuts.
  Positive
One curiosity for this reviewer is that religion plays no role in the story.
  Negative
The omission has been noted in other European films of late.
  Neutral
Whatever the reason for it, the decision seems at odds with how such scenarios often played out in real life, just as it removes us from the omnipresent obsession with God in the Sweden of  Ingmar Bergman.
  Negative
Of course, there is a hint of religion in the name that Elle-Marja takes as her urban disguise, Christina, and its to the films credit that it shows that leaving behind her Sami identity hasnt made her happy' indeed, she seems to have internalized all the insults once visited on her.
  Positive
