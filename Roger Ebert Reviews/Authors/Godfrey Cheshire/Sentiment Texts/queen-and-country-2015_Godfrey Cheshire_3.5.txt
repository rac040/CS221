Auteurship, to paraphrase a familiar ad, has its privileges.
  Positive
In the standard Hollywood way of making movies, stories designed to galvanize millions often derived from books or comic strips that have already done so and stars that can open films are what get productions funded.
  Negative
In Europe, traditional home of the auteur, however, things are somewhat different: A movie like  John Boormans Queen and Country with no stars and a story based on the filmmakers own life can attract financing because the auteurs distinctive gifts are considered sufficient to guarantee it audiences and prestige.
  Negative
Which is to say that Boormans latest is not for folks whove never heard of John Boorman.

  Negative
The effect this has on morale is not salutary.
  Negative
When one conscript refuses service in Korea citing Bills opinion that its an immoral war, he is charged with seducing a soldier from the course of his duty  an indictment containing a verb thats the source of much merriment and jibing.

  Negative
Yet its steadily engrossing due to Boormans surpassing skills as both a storyteller and a director.
  Positive
Indeed, Queen and Country could serve as a master class on how to build interesting characters in even the smallest roles, and how to stage scenes with a maximum of expressiveness, elegance and economy.
