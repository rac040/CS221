With its monk protagonist caught up in a web of international intrigue, and its cast of upper-crust characters secluded in a luxurious resort, the polished Italian drama The Confessions might remind viewers of films ranging from  The Name of the Rose to  Paolo Sorrentinos  Youth.
  Positive
But Roberto Ands film disappointingly ends up being too flat-footed script-wise to deliver on either its dramatic or thematic promises.
  Negative
The contemporary tale starts off giving us a few glimpses of Roberto Salus  Toni Servillo, an aging monk whod look right at home in an El Greco painting, as he speaks some cryptic words into a mini tape recorder he carries, and then, after what appears to be fleeting religious vision outside an airport, is picked up and whisked to a plush waterside hotel somewhere in Germany.
  Very negative
We soon see that the humble monk, who will set aside his vow of silence for this sojourn, has been invited to join a gathering of ministers from G countries still including Russia, a meeting that also involves the International Monetary Fund.
  Negative
At the groups initial dinner, the weekends sense of dramatic importance is underscored, but the intent is left entirely muddy.
  Negative
Are these representatives of the worlds most prosperous countries working on a plan to excuse the debts of their poorest brethren, or are they about to put the screws to the poorer nations even more forcefully than before?
  Negative
The dinner is presided over by the head of the IMF, a sternly imposing man named Daniel Roch  Daniel Auteuil, excellent as ever.
  Positive
From the first, there are absurdly incongruous elements to this gathering.
  Negative
Besides Salus, it inexplicably includes a famous author of childrens books  Connie Nielsen and a rock star Johan Heldenberg, who leads the group in a postprandial sing-along of  Lou Reeds Walk on the Wild Side, with risqu lyrics that jar against the monks austere presence.
  Negative
After dinner, we learn why Salus has been invited to the gathering.
  Negative
Roch asks the monk to his quarters and says he wants him to hear his confession.
  Negative
We dont see the confession as the scene progresses, however.
  Negative
Rather, the film cuts away and returns to the confession in flashbacks later in the tale.
  Negative
The next morning, a shocking discovery is made: Roch has committed suicide by putting a plastic bag over his head.
  Negative
As it happens, the bag is one that Salus used to store his little tape recorder.
  Negative
Did Salus record the confession?
  Neutral
If so, where is the tape?
  Neutral
And was the death really a suicide, or could it have been murder?
  Negative
These and other questions are asked as the group stirs around in consternation in the wake of the deaths discovery.
  Negative
There are expressions of concern that the markets will react violently when the news is announced on Monday.
  Negative
All of this leads to a lot of hushed conversations, suspicious glances and nervous movements.
  Negative
As to whether the groups plans the nature of which remain murky will continue, thats an open question.
  Negative
Occasionally they receive querulous instructions via Skype from a stern woman, but her identity is as unclear as the gatherings purpose.
  Negative
While most of the groups characters never gain any clear identity a big flaw in a film like this a couple eventually emerge as having some definition.
  Positive
The childrens book author rooms next to Salus and spies on him through a keyhole, but her purposes seem neither malicious nor voyeuristic' shes sympathetic, and wants to help him when he falls under suspicion.
  Negative
Another sympathetic character, the Italian minister  Pierfrancesco Favino also asks to confess to Salus, apparently due to a crisis of conscience caused by his work.
  Negative
That plot twist points toward larger questions at the films clotted center.
  Negative
Are these people simply arrogant, soulless functionaries in charge of the worlds finances, or are some of them motivated by idealism and a desire to do good?
  Negative
And what, after all, are they up to in this working retreat?
  Neutral
Ultimately, that question touches on the nature of the movie itself.
  Neutral
Are And and co-screenwriter  Angelo Pasquini trying to say something pointed and incisive about the moral nature of the people who control our economic fates, and the growing chasm between rich and poor, both individuals and nations?
  Negative
Or is this tale simply meant to be a more au courant Agatha Christie-like whodunit?
  Neutral
Unfortunately, the film succeeds in neither regard.
  Negative
The mystery of the IMF heads apparent suicide remains dramatically diffuse while the storys social-commentary angle is equally unfocused.
  Negative
Worse, there are few characters worthy of our interest.
  Positive
Salus remains a mostly-silent presence throughout, and if the filmmakers would like us see him as some sort of moral beacon, they fail to give him any human credibility.
  Negative
The films strongest suit is its elegant photography and confident mounting, but these virtues do little to offset the scripts pervasive weaknesses.
  Positive
