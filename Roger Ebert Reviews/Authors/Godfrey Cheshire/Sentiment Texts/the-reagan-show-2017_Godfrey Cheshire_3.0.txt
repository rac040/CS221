Pacho Velez and  Sierra Pettengills The Reagan Show is a -minute nonfiction film comprised entirely of newsreel and video footage from  Ronald Reagans presidency.
  Negative
Given that its subject was a very divisive figure despite what some latter-day mythologies would suggest one might well wonder whether its pro-Reagan or anti-Reagan.
  Negative
The answer: neither.
  Neutral
Or rather, both Reagan lovers and Reagan haters will find enough in the film to bolster their perspectives.
  Neutral
Even more remarkably, its almost entirely snark-free.
  Negative
At a time when sharp ideological stances are annoyingly ubiquitous, this films lack of one is refreshing.
  Positive
But my commendation comes with a caveat for people who may have slept through the Reagan presidency, or those too young to remember it.
  Negative
While the film does offer a chronicle of Reagans eight years in office, it focuses mainly on one aspect of that history.
  Positive
Much is left out.
  Neutral
To take one of many possible examples, theres no mention of Reagans disastrously underwhelming response to the AIDS crisis, which left many people dead and many others apoplectic with anger.
  Negative
Of the Iran-Contra scandal you hear a bit, but it never gets to the Congressional hearings that put military martinet Col.  Oliver North in Americas living rooms for too many evenings running.
  Negative
The names of Lebanon, Nicaragua, Grenada and Afghanistan are never heard.
  Negative
And so on.
  Neutral
The aspect of Reagans time in office the film chooses to highlight is his stance toward the Soviet Union and especially his evolving relationship with Soviet premier  Mikhail Gorbachev, which eventually produced a landmark nuclear arms-reduction treaty.
  Negative
Yet it wouldnt be accurate to say that this is the films subject.
  Positive
Rather, the filmmakers seem most interested in using the US-USSR story as a way of suggesting how every aspect of Reagans presidency was bound up with his sense of televisual performance.
  Negative
John F. Kennedy is sometimes called the first TV president, mostly because his  election was the first in which television was seen to have had a big, perhaps decisive impact on the outcome, and because his movie-star looks were so TV-friendly.
  Negative
But JFK himself was a product of the pre-TV age, as were three subsequent presidents who were effectively unseated by the new medium: Lyndon Johnson by its coverage of the Vietnam War'  Richard Nixon by the televised Watergate Hearings' and Jimmy Carter by year-long horror show known as the Iran Hostage Crisis, which bequeathed us the show Nightline.
  Negative
Reagan was the first real TV president in that he not only was suited to and mastered the medium but literally emerged from it like a phantasm jumping out of a cathode tubes fluorescent ether in an episode of Twin Peaks.
  Negative
While The Reagan Show gives us clips of some of Reagans  movies as actor in which he forged his image as an all-American hero, it doesnt note his career as a corporate pitchman for General Electric and host of TVs Death Valley Days.
  Negative
The latter may well have been more crucial to his political career than the former.
  Neutral
At least, the Hollywood hero content could not have been put across so successfully without the Madison Avenue polish that Americans had been absorbing mentally via TV for a generation when Reagan ran for president in .
  Negative
In some of the contemporary news reports in The Reagan Show, we hear of Reagans laziness, vacuousness, disengagement, and so on.
  Negative
Its said that he spent one third of his time working on stuff and two-thirds selling it.
  Positive
But boy, could he sell' that folksy grin and square-jawed aw-shucks manner could have put over anything from shampoo to suicide.
  Negative
That was what was scary about him then and now: the sense that style always ran roughshod over substance in the Reagan ethos.
  Negative
Did he really believe anything that was beyond a sales pitch?
  Negative
Heres perhaps a better question: Was Reagans mind so deeply conditioned by Hollywood myths and his old movie roles that, on some level, he couldnt distinguish between those fictions and reality?
  Negative
And: if  George Lucas hadnt made a certain silly sci-fi movie a few years before Reagan became president, would he have become obsessed with a program for militarizing outer space that was nicknamed  Star Wars, an idea even more cuckoo and costly than that of building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border?
  Negative
The Star Wars fantasy-reality conundrum may well bedevil historians for decades to come.
  Positive
In The Reagan Show we hear Star Wars denounced for its impracticality, its expense and especially its inevitable way of producing a new arms race.
  Negative
None of this swayed Reagan.
  Negative
But the obsession did soon run into a new reality.
  Neutral
The reformist Gorbachev also a skilled manipulator of images was in charge in Moscow and making nice with western leaders.
  Positive
Would Reagan meet him?
  Neutral
Would he listen to him, especially on the touchy subject of arms control?
  Neutral
The Reagan Show documents the various meetings of the two leaders over two years and how a rapport and guarded respect between them helped lead to a plan to eliminate all nuclear weapons by the year  though, significantly, Star Wars was kept off the table obsessions die hard.
  Very negative
This section of the film convinced me that Reagan was a tough, shrewd and informed negotiator, as well as a president who wanted peace as part of his legacy.
  Negative
Ironically, his own party despised his appeasement while Democrats cheered it.
  Positive
And it would be left to future Republican presidents including one birthed from reality TV to trash that treaty and begin a new arms race.
  Negative
