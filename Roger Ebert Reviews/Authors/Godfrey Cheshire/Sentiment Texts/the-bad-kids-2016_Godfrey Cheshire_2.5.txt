In terms of documentaries and their appeal to different audiences, two basic types might be discerned.
  Negative
One, which could be called the artistic doc, puts an emphasis on stylistic excellence and originality in offering penetrating, revealing views of their subjects, which could be, quite literally, anything.
  Very positive
These are films that get rave reviews, draw general audiences to movie theaters, and end up on Oscar shortlists.
  Positive
The second type might be called the niche doc.
  Neutral
These appeal primarily to viewers who have a particular interest in their subjects.
  Positive
This type of film finds its natural audiences on television and in various specialized venues, sometimes educational, via different kinds of outreach efforts.
  Positive
Keith Fulton and  Lou Pepes The Bad Kids belongs to the second type, but seems to imagine that its the first.
  Negative
Why it might think that is because its one of those films that emerges from what might be called the Gates FoundationSundance InstituteGeorge SorosFord Foundation complex, which often gives us docs that due to their prestigious institutional backing and socially conscious themes sometimes make it into certain big festivals i.e., Sundance and even movie theaters.
  Negative
Because some people automatically equate a liberal-humanistic outlook and social concerns with artistic worth, a film like The Bad Kids can gain a theatrical release.
  Negative
But its not a film for most general theatrical audiences, even those specifically interested in documentaries.
  Neutral
Its for people interested in its main concern: education.
  Neutral
The film is mischievously titled.
  Negative
The kids at its center are not at all bad, as we immediately see.
  Negative
Eleventh and twelfthgraders who attend the Black Rock Continuation High School, an alternative school in a poor corner of Californias Mojave Desert, they are considered at risk due to various factors that might keep them from earning high school diplomas: troubled homes, criminal activity, drug habits, or just bad attitudes.
  Very negative
The school attempts to overcome these obstacles by letting the students design their own curricula and proceed at their own paces, while also offering them various forms of support, counseling and extracurricular help.
  Negative
The filmmakers spend several months in the school, focusing on a few students and its very committed and skillful female principal.
  Positive
Joey, a scrawny disaffected blond boy, we first see when a truancy officer visits his home and asks what he wants out of life.
  Negative
His inchoate response only hints at troubles that begin with his moms drug addiction.
  Negative
He has a habit too, but is also a talented guitar player and songwriter: not a really bad kid by a long shot.
  Positive
As The Bad Kids follows him over the months, Joey comes and goes, vis a vis whats asked of him at Black Rock.
  Negative
One day we see him give another student a brief description of the difference between Thomas Hobbes and John Locke, adding that his favorite philosopher is Voltaire.
  Negative
No dummy he, obviously.
  Negative
But other times he doesnt show up at school and has to admit, when he does return, that hes been using.
  Negative
We witness a similar waxing and waning with Lee, a burly black guy who has a child with another student, a skinny bespectacled girl named Layla.
  Negative
The two seem to want to do the best for their adorable little boy, but Lee has difficulties with his elders at home, as do many of these kids.
  Negative
Sometimes he appears quietly motivated' at other times, about to slide off the planet, with no idea why he should be struggling for a diploma.
  Negative
The schools principal, Vonda Viland, is a truly compelling figure whos endlessly but very unpretentiously dedicated to her mission.
  Very positive
From the time each school day begins, when shes out front of Black Rock offering smiles and cheery greetings to students, though an arduous day of tete-a-tetes with her sometimes difficult charges, she stays focused and eloquent, occasionally giving kids very personal examples from her own life that they can relate to.
  Positive
The fact that the school is so successful at getting the majority of its students to the goal of graduation obviously owes a lot to her energy and expertise.
  Positive
I said above that the films subject is education, but of course theres another too: poverty.
  Neutral
Though its nowhere nearly as striking and complex and  Marc Levin and  Daphne Pinkersons  Class Divide, a brilliant education-themed doc from earlier this year, The Bad Kids also shows the effects economic inequity has on schools and the kids who pass through them.
  Neutral
The film is mounted in a serviceable but undistinguished verit manner that eschews talking heads, explanatory titles and other means of conveying information.
  Negative
This of course is the approved style for many docs now, especially those that want to be considered artistic, but here it leaves unaddressed various questions its primary audience is bound to wonder about.
  Positive
How was the schools approach developed?
  Neutral
How many schools in the country use it, and with what rates of success?
  Negative
What kind of backing does it get from the state of California and the local school board?
  Negative
What happens to the kids who dont make it to graduation day?
  Neutral
The Bad Kids is interesting enough in what it shows us to spark interest in what it leaves un-shown.
  Positive
In its case, the information supplied by a few well-chosen talking heads could have given it additional clarity and appeal.
  Negative
