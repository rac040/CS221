If movies were rated according to the importance of their subject matter, then  George Mendeluks Bitter Harvest, which tells of the devastating famine Josef Stalin visited on the Ukraine in the s, would deserve an unqualified four stars.
  Negative
If the same film were judged solely on its cinematic quality, though, it would barely merit one star.
  Negative
Im giving it two here as a way of recognizing the interest of the historical horror it rather clumsily addresses.
  Negative
As readers of Timothy D. Snyders magisterial study Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin will know, the two great European despots of the last century inflicted enormous suffering and staggering casualties not only on various populations but also on the nations that separated Germany and Russia.
  Negative
Yet even before Hitlers armies swept across Poland, where it built many of the death camps that would be used in the slaughter of Europes Jews, Stalin had already set a high bar in the mass-murder department with his deliberate starvation of millions of Ukrainians.
  Negative
The Nazis genocide, which came to be known as the Holocaust, has been treated in an endless stream of movies, both documentary and dramatic, as well as books, articles, TV shows and public commemorations and memorials across the West.
  Very negative
Stalins crime in the Ukraine, now called the Holodomor, was never given similar attention and now is little-known outside the part of the world where it took place.
  Negative
Without question, the Holodomor deserves examination, interrogation and commemoration.
  Negative
But it strikes me that the best place to start, cinema-wise, might be with a documentary that has the scope and power of  Claude Lanzmanns  Shoah.
  Positive
Almost inevitably, approaching the subject via a standard-length dramatic feature risks reducing the cataclysms enormity to a trivializing size and emotional impact.
  Negative
Unfortunately, Bitter Harvest cant even claim the virtues of a superior dramatic feature.
  Negative
Born in Germany of Ukrainian descent, Mendeluk has spent most his career as a director of Canadian TV movies, which this film unsurprisingly resembles.
  Negative
Although its title recalls  Angry Harvest, a brilliant Holocaust film, Bitter Harvest resembles no estimable European or American movie on such subjects as much as it does a lot of sub-par and instantly forgotten video attempts to plumb historical abominations.
  Negative
Its narrative and visual approach almost suggests a compendium of the clichs one should avoid in a film like this.
  Negative
The first, which occupies the tales opening sections, might be called the clich of the Happy Peasantry.
  Negative
In images that recall a Campbells soup commercial, we see the farm families of one Ukrainian village joyfully tilling their acres, harvesting their abundant crops and displaying their roomy, well-washed blouses and Cossack shirts' they are the descendants of proud warriors, were told, who venerate their noble traditions and Eastern Orthodox faith.
  Negative
Rather dubiously, its posited that their blissfully bucolic way of life continues through the Russian Revolution, the murder of the Czars family and Lenins regime.
  Negative
Its only when Stalin ascends the Kremlin throne that storm clouds from the east come roaring in.
  Negative
In this initial section, we also encounter the dual clichs of Hero as Sensitive Artist and Young Lovers Sundered.
  Negative
The peasant who loves to paint is the dreamily-handsome Yuri  Max Irons, whose favorite subject is the girl hes had a crush on since childhood, Natalka  Samantha Barks.
  Negative
Here the films imagery recalls shampoo ads.
  Negative
Alas, though Yuri has been proclaiming his love for  or so years, Natalka still balks at marriage.
  Negative
Soon hes persuaded to move to Kiev to study art, and the village he leaves behind is invaded by brutish Soviet troops, who show their hostility to religion by stealing devotional icons and roughing up the local priest.
  Negative
In Kiev, Yuri studies under a modernist who urges him to emulate the Surrealists and big names like Picasso, and we know its trouble when this guy is replaced by an automaton demanding Socialist Realism.
  Negative
Life in the big city, meanwhile, increasingly becomes a political nightmare as Ukrainian Communist leaders, including friends of Yuris from back home, are liquidated and replaced by commissars from Russia.
  Negative
Occasionally, the scene shifts to the Kremlin, where we see Stalin giving orders that he knows will kill millions.
  Negative
Ukraine is known as the breadbasket of Europe, and the Soviet leader wants its grain to feed his vast nation.
  Negative
But hes also out to subdue the farming population into forced collectivization, and that entails leaving the farmers with less grain than they need to plant the next years crop, much less feed their families.
  Negative
The cruelty of this campaign offers ample testament to the extraordinary evils of leftist totalitarianism, much as Auschwitz does to the rightist variety.
  Positive
But Bitter Harvest does little to advance its rhetorical case with scenes like the unintentionally silly one where the villages Soviet commander begins flashing on his mother while trying to ravish Natalka paging Dr. Freud!
  Negative
.
  Neutral
Seriousness apart, though, theres undeniable entertainment value in a number of scenes in which the magnificent  Terence Stamp, as Yuris grandfather, displays his Cossack-fighting skills.
  Positive
If Grandpa had been able to go mano a mano with Stalin, no doubt this dark chapter in world history mightve had a brighter ending.
  Negative
