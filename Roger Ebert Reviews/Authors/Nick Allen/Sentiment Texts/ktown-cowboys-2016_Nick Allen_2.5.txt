Adapted from the popular YouTube series that dates back to , Ktown Cowboys follows a quintet of Korean-American men as they ride through raucous Los Angeles day and night, offering a first-person perspective into different facets of Koreatown life by using filmmaking tricks  la  The Big Short quick cuts and fourth-wall breaks.Executive produced by and featuring a cameo from  Ken Jeong, the project proves to have limits to its comedic imagination, offering some refreshing sweetness most of all in its portrayal of extremely macho friendship.
  Positive
With established characters to work from, the hard-partying men of Ktown Cowboys are more than one-dimensional archetypes, even if their life dramas feel headed towards clich.
  Negative
For example, lead focus and rich kid Jason  Shane Yoon is dealing with legal troubles at work, while having a life passion to open a club.
  Positive
Experiencing similar stress is Robby  Bobby Choy, who was adopted by white parents played by  Eric Roberts and Rhonda Alrdich and is wrestling with the idea of leaving behind his job to learn more about his heritage in Korea.
  Negative
Meanwhile, Peter  Peter Jae brings some comic relief as a lovable lug and fashion designer, while co-writer  Danny Cho gets the smallest arc, appearing in a couple of funny stand-up moments as hustling comedian Danny.The most emotionally successful story might belong to Sunny  Sunn Wee, who has to with take care of his father who suffers from Alzheimers, while inheriting the family liquor store.
  Positive
With impressively concise storytelling from debut director  Daniel Park, we know more than just their jobs and ambitions, and become connected to these characters as their mini-arcs are tied together.
  Positive
Park coats the big heart he has for these people with warm LA lens flares, and finds energy from sharp cuts and wall-to-wall music.
  Very positive
Its the performances that prove to be spotty, with flat line-readings all around and displays of emotions that struggle to reach from the script to the audience.
  Neutral
With its YouTube series origins in mind, Ktown Cowboys falls in line with two other shows about young men of urban nightlife, its flaws revealed by certain similarities.
  Negative
Like  Aziz Ansaris Netflix series Master of None, Parks film offers a personal experience of being at tough junctures of maturity, while dealing with parts of heritage without characters being defined strictly by ethnicity.
  Negative
But while Ansaris show manages to find revelations in common experience, Ktown Cowboys often lacks an original voice or the wit for which its aiming, especially regarding musings on friendship and identity.
  Negative
The lack of comedic imagination especially when restricted by a small budget in Ktown Cowboys often leads to stale situations about sexual extremes, genitalia or even gay panic.
  Negative
In contrast, the funniest moments come from downplayed jabs they lob at each other, like when Danny tells an overly anxious Peter about Sunny, Dude, hes going to Korea, not war, dumbass.
  Negative
Its a throwaway line that speaks to the honesty within the crews chemistry, topping that weary  Entourage influence with characters who are immediately more likable.
  Positive
From the show's pilot, Ktown Cowboys has been designed to focus on, and be inclusive about, the different terms within Ktown life' its a shame that zippy presentations of concepts like booking it's like speed-dating or even FOB fresh off the boat use the film's male-focus to limit gestures of diversity.
  Negative
Aside from lacking any non-nagging Korean-American woman of the same age, Ktown Cowboys makes us aware of antiquated enterprises like dohmis, women who are paid to hang out and flirt during karaoke sessions, but as Danny insists while breaking the fourth wall, are not prostitutes.
  Negative
Theyre like modern-day geishas, he reasons.
  Negative
And usually, no sex is involved  unless you got game.
  Negative
Ktown Cowboys disappointingly doesnt challenge or question these notions, exposing a condescending conservative side in order to cater a hit-and-miss guys night out.
  Negative
