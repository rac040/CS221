Dogs are mans best friend but also one of his most tedious metaphors.
  Negative
Filmmakers like to use them to rhyme with human aggression, while showing that a creatures propensity for violence comes down to how they are treated'  Jeremy Saulnier used a wandering pit bull in the final act of this years  Green Room to great effect, showing the soft side of an animal seen earlier in the film as a throat-ripping soldier.
  Negative
But unfortunately, dog metaphors prove to be only one of writerdirector  Jason Lews problems, as his debut The Free World is riddled with more than a few unfortunate directorial choices.
  Negative
The Free World starts with a close-up of a man talking to someone about getting used to captivity, and relating to them in the process.
  Negative
The revealing shot is of a dog, inside a pen thats inside an animal shelter.
  Positive
The man,  Boyd Holbrooks Mo Lundy, is a former convict with an ugly history of violence in prison who now tends to stray and abused dogs at the Second Hope Animal Shelter.
  Negative
The whimsy isnt just in his constant framing behind cages, but in his boss too.
  Negative
Played by  Octavia Spencer, she advises him with pulpy platitudes like, Bury the past, or it will bury you.
  Negative
We learn about Mo's past, which is curious on paper.
  Neutral
He was known as Cyclops in prison, but has since found peace in Islam he refers to himself as Mohammed and lives alone.
  Positive
Said past does come up to haunt him when he provides shelter to Doris  Elisabeth Moss, who has murdered her abusive husband, a smug, macho cop.
  Negative
Its directly hinted that her husband is abusive from an earlier scene, in which the couple came to the shelter with her bloodied dog, Charlie, that he proudly beat up.
  Neutral
The first extended scene between the two is a revealing example.
  Positive
She wakes in his apartment after she passed out in his shelter a day earlier, with blood on his hands.
  Neutral
Unsure of where she is or what he may have done to her, she tries to attack him, with the visceral psychological terror of a horror movie.
  Negative
He is able to peacefully let her know that he did no harm.
  Positive
But you can almost time it as to when the energy from this moment disappears, especially as lifeless blocking is divided with a dull shot-reverse-shot exchange, with empty beats wedged between them.
  Negative
In spite of what the performances offer in this moment, the filmmaking has no energy of its own.
  Negative
This altercation ends with Moss hiding inside a dog carrier when the police show up, in case you missed the captivity symbolism from earlier.
  Negative
Though there is a lot of movie after this scene, the rest of it takes on the same exact spirit of this moment Mo tries to protect Doris, while trying to avoid the police.
  Negative
Stubborn with the dog idea, when Mo is later intensely interviewed by a detective  Sung Kang at the shelter, Lew uses crescendoing dog barking in his sound design.
  Negative
When Mo and Doris finally ditch town, and the damn dog metaphors, the storys initial motivations receive no better poetry.
  Negative
Mos inner beast is awoken, and Doris becomes a damsel in distress.
  Positive
Holbrook and Moss have something within their respective performances that would work if the movie did not feel so alternately over- or undercooked.
  Negative
The sluggish pacing and the often dark lighting of their emotionally revealing conversations yearn for some importance, but the films clunky execution says otherwise.
  Very negative
There is no tension as they bond or are being pursued' in spite of the time spent with these characters, they do not exist beyond archetypes.
  Negative
Foiled by its empty poetry, The Free World squanders its potential to richly explore the human aspects of its curious creatures.
  Negative
