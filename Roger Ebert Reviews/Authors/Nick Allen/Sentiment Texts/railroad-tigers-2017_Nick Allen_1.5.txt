You can tell a lot about a director by how they direct a train sequence.
  Neutral
With scenes that required locomotive management just as much as filmmaking precision, directors ranging from  Buster Keaton to  Justin Lin for The General and  Fast Five, respectively created classic spectacle out of playing with and then destroying trains.
  Negative
In the case of Chinese director  Ding Sheng and his latest film, Railroad Tigers, which features many sequences on trains but not a single nominee for locomotive movie history, its non-cohesive set pieces only symbolize the wreck this venture quickly becomes.
  Very negative
Though it boasts a large scope with its ensemble cast, huge sequences and the star power of the almighty  Jackie Chan, Railroad Tigers lacks the vital focus to come together.
  Negative
Within Jackie Chans oeuvre, this one is for Chan completists only, if due to his lack of action, despite being a leader of the title freedom fighters group.
  Negative
The year is , and Chans Ma Yuan works with a ragtag group of young men to cause havoc on the Japanese army that occupies China.
  Negative
Their main method is by hijacking trains and stealing supplies, as shown in an opening sequence where they knock out some soldiers and inscribe their group logo a tiger with wings on the soldiers' bare stomachs.
  Negative
The Railroad Tigers have a less vague purpose when they come across a wounded soldier, who speaks about plans to bomb a bridge that helps the Japanese army get their supplies.
  Negative
Inspired by the war effort and open to a suicide mission, Ma Yuan and friends decide to attack the bridge themselves.
  Negative
Theyre pursued by the stone-cold Yamaguchi  Hiroyuki Ikeuchi, a captain of the Japanese military police.
  Negative
If only this very simple story was more cohesive with tone.
  Positive
Starting with slapstick but eventually transitioning into dark moments of pain, Railroad Tigers doesnt have the finesse to pull off a more innocent riff on Inglorious Basterds.
  Negative
Its cartoonish impulses sully the historical stakes, and vice versa That really hurt!
  Negative
a soldier says, impaled by his own overturned vehicle.
  Negative
Even more disorienting, its all framed as a flashback, started by a young boy looking into a train engine marked with the Tigers' symbol.
  Negative
Along with the title cards that clue viewers in to each scene Rob the Train, Railroad Tigers clearly wants to be understood by all, including kids, but runs like a careless comedy about the sacrifices of war.
  Negative
And about those title cards: they only become a shallow gesture at involving the viewer, especially as the amount of information thrown at the screen doesnt lead to emotional attachment to anyone or anything.
  Negative
The hugeness of the story and its lack of tension becomes all the more apparent with a scant promise of surprise, and so many characters important enough to receive their own designation.
  Negative
It makes Railroad Tigers all the more inconsequential the kind of stakes you don't want to have when your movie involves a wartime ensemble and a massive train set.
  Negative
Enthusiasts of train sequences in movies will be pleased to know that the locomotives get a lot of screen-time in Railroad Tigers, for a robbery, an escape, a chase and more.
  Negative
But said devotees will be deterred, if not distracted as I was, by the amount of blue screen usage in each sequence, seemingly any time Ma Yuan and his crew are outside the trains.
  Negative
With that in mind, the editing does little to clarify essential ideas like geography or distance when it comes to different train cars.
  Negative
The third act does succeed with striking visuals mostly from its practical set, appearing like sunlight after a day of fog.
  Positive
With little to grab onto and despite all that it offers Railroad Tigers is far slower than a goofy action movie that mostly takes place on a locomotive should ever be.
  Negative
Not even Chan provides charisma for a fan like yours truly to find solace in, as he is on-screen often but activated for very little.
  Neutral
Instead, his charm is taken and spread thin between a group of young men that lack personality, individually or collectively, with only their age to make them much different than Chan.
  Negative
Its one of many ways that the movie cheapens itself, making for non-compelling viewing instead of a smooth ride.
  Negative
