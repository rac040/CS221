Even if I Do Until I Dont were not the work of very promising actorwriterdirector  Lake Bell, it would still be a strange disappointment.
  Negative
Bell is just one of the notable actors here, as joined by  Ed Helms,  Mary Steenburgen,  Paul Reiser,  Amber Heard and  Wyatt Cenac.
  Negative
Its baffling, more than anything, as to how all of this talent could create something so uncharacteristic to their collective abilities to make us laugh, or feel something.
  Positive
I Do Until I Dont offers scenes from three different marriages.
  Neutral
Alice Bell and her husband Noah Ed Helms run a blinds business that is in need of a boost, and not just from a good pun, which makes for a stale sequence where the couple brainstorm out loud different puns for their business.
  Negative
Alice is also struggling to get pregnant, which is Noahs fixation even when the power goes out at their small store.
  Negative
Across town, an older couple, Cybil Mary Steenburgen and Harvey Paul Reiser, are years into their marriage and cant believe they made it this far.
  Negative
Harvey gets a motorcycle in order to appease some type of crisis, while Cybil tries to reconnect with her estranged daughter, Milly  Hannah Friedman.
  Negative
They might be the most interesting couple in the story, even if their beats are familiar.
  Positive
The couple written with weakest writing are the young hippies Fanny Amber Heard and Zander Wyatt Cenac.
  Negative
Their problem, if it can be considered that, concerns the fragile bond of their polyamorous ways which we soon learn are more complicated.
  Negative
They mostly serve to offer the movie cheap hippie jokes about them not understanding personal space, or that they haven't even told their young son that TVs exist.
  Negative
True to the unimaginative way in which this movie visually tells its story, these subjects become the focus of a documentary by BBC talent Vivian Prudeck  Dolly Wells, a hammy, snooty woman who seeks to prove her thesis that marriage is a sham.
  Negative
Instead, she pitches her film subjects on the idea that marriage should be treated like seven-year contract, and renewed if so desired.
  Negative
This idea isnt followed through so much in the documentary that Vivian does make with her subjects, but it soon becomes apparent that she will do anything to get footage to prove her point.
  Negative
Aside from making her a tiresome idea of a phony intellectual, she becomes an easy villain, while pushing the couples to the bullet points this movie treats like epiphanies: Relationships are hard' communication can save relationships' love is the answer, etc.
  Negative
There is a baffling lack of originality to the story that always arises.
  Negative
It starts with Vivians English accent doing a voiceover about how love and marriage are not sustainable, which is revealed to be a lecture that Alice is attending.
  Negative
Large jokes then include easy targets like Fanny and Zanders hippy existence, or a massage parlor that emphasizes on happy endings.
  Negative
The framing device of a documentary about relationships proves not just common as well but underutilized, with most of the marital strife taking place where Vivian is not filming.
  Negative
Theres even a baby about to pop in the finale.
  Neutral
Its ideas like this thrown into the story, along with the groups idea to later get revenge on the marriage cynic, that show how this movie merely wants to be liked while struggling to have personality.
  Negative
As well, theres a strange slightness that comes with its rough draft construction.
  Negative
Its a movie thats working through something, as with its portrayals of different relationships that are challenged by communication spouses, mothers, sisters, friends.
  Negative
But the stakes are rendered low from the start concerning the lifespan of the couples, even with Bells game cast trying to sell different depictions of marital strife.
  Negative
Resolutions seem to come rather quickly, with little more than the scripts nice gesture to show lovers resolve their differences.
  Negative
There's little to take away from this film, aside from the anamorphic view of Long Beach, where bright sunny days contrast a desaturated look with some  Woody Allen free flow.
  Negative
And as Bell seems to own clichs more than challenge them, or let comic jokes lay flat, I Do Until I Dont marks a strange turn from the characteristic creativity of her previous efforts.
  Negative
It isnt as painful as breaking up, but it gets close.
  Negative
