Dramedy Dont Worry Baby may not be all that memorable, but the premise sure is: A guy might be the biological father of his own fathers illegitimate child with another woman.
  Negative
Its the Tribeca version of a Maury episode, dressed up with Millennial malaise and upper class mid-life crises, as told with an overly straight face and wholesale indie presentation.
  Very negative
Debut writerdirector  Julian Branciforte eventually loses control of his tricky pitch, especially as his generic vision can't support the story with a distinct tone.
  Negative
The film does have a narrative economy, covering a great deal of territory in the first - minutes.
  Very positive
We meet a budding photographer named Robert  John Magaro,  The Big Short, who is rejecting offers from his distant father, Harry  Christopher McDonald, to work for him.
  Negative
The night after a photo shoot, Robert meets a woman his age named Sara-Beth  Dreama Walker, they come back to his apartment together and boom the story jumps to four years later.
  Negative
A lot has changed: Robert's photography dreams have dissipated, and he now works at his dads prestigious downtown preschool' Harry has just enrolled Mason, his illegitimate daughter, into the class that Robert is overseeing.
  Negative
Robert soon meets the mother, and is shocked when its Sara-Beth.
  Positive
The math of conception is soon performed, and after realizing that he could be the father instead of Harry, a paternity test is taken, to their equal contention.
  Negative
From this point, the movie merely follows them around as they wait for the results, while they both sneakily vie for Sara-Beth and share time with Mason.
  Negative
"Don't Worry Baby"'s perspective on this saga is appropriately unusual.
  Neutral
It sidesteps the bizarreness of the situation by placing characters in a shared air of acceptance, but feels too light with the new, life-changing developments that await.
  Negative
Branciforte invests time in the dour headspace of possible-dad Robert, but theres little dramatic tension.
  Negative
The animosity is clear in the fine chemistry between Magaro and McDonald, especially as disheveled Robert doesnt believe that estranged dad Harry deserves a second chance, but Branciforte ultimately fails to make us care about paternity test results.
  Negative
Dreama Walker has too little of a character to work with, despite playing the woman who gave birth to this contested child' Harry's ex-wife Miriam  Talia Balsam tries to normalize the scenario by eye-rolling through her ex-husband getting a younger woman pregnant, but her response too feels idealized.
  Very negative
By being so hands-off about its tense topics, a whole gender seems muted, and the movie fails to communicate an awareness beyond its macho showdown.
  Negative
Branciforte's writing lacks the nuance to take its absurd concept seriously, so it awkwardly injects comedy.
  Negative
Its often too broad, as when Roberts comic relief roommate Lenny  Tom Lipinski is brought in as a playful nuisance, as if he came from a different dimension.
  Negative
Fights between Robert and Harry also fall flat like when theyre both in the car with Sara-Beth, trying to woo her, lacking the sharp tongue that could make the emotional screwball underneath this plot resonate.
  Very negative
By the end, Branciforte answers the -minutes-in question of WTF?
  Negative
with a unique, warm sensibility about the non-nuclear family unit.
  Positive
Its a fondness that recalls other domestic storytellers, from  Hirokazu Kore-eda to  Adam Sandler, who offer distinct takes on unique family situations.
  Positive
Whether completely downplaying it like Kore-eda or playing it way up like Sandler, theres little life to be found somewhere in the middle.
  Negative
