A -year-old sex addiction therapist discovers he has a benign tumor in his brain after getting ferociously dinged in the testicles during a game of pick-up basketball.
  Negative
It proves to be a good thing the surgery to remove the tumor helps put his long-dormant pituitary gland in action, essentially hurling him into pubescence over the course of three weeks.
  Negative
Sex, masturbation, pimples and squeaky voices are all new personal experiences to Peter  Johnny Simmons, and we witness them possess him in clichd sequences like a demonic possession.
  Negative
Set within standards of a sub-genre that rely heavily on skin, sex talk, body fluid and slapstick, debut director Kevin Pollak's raunchy comedy "The Late Bloomer" is merely cheesy and horny, but rarely amusing.
  Negative
Its all based on a true story, or as the opening credits suggest, Some ridiculously fked up sht.
  Negative
But the real life guy is  Ken Baker, an E! TV personality whose memoir Man Made: A Memoir of My Bodycame out in .
  Negative
That The Late Bloomer manages to screw up his stranger-than-fiction story is a revealing flaw' answering to Kens tale with the irony of an unqualified but somehow brilliant sex therapist is a grotesque contrivance that pointlessly makes the films pitch more confusing.
  Negative
How can this intelligent man think he should talk to people about sex when he hasnt had any?
  Neutral
In articles on Baker, he says that  denial was a huge factorto the secrecy of his condition.
  Negative
But The Late Bloomer turns a fascinating biological concept one with comedic potential, yes into a huge stretch, distancing us from whatever made Pollak want to tell this story in the first place.
  Positive
Pollaks film does have the boost of Johnny Simmons, who showed that he was game for an unusual masculine narrative with this years  The Phenom, a baseball player drama that takes place off the pitchers mound.
  Positive
Here, hes cast for how boyish he can look as a -year-old with a lifeless haircut and oversized suit.
  Negative
But his appearance is played, like everything else, far too on-the-nose.
  Negative
Once Peters puberty begins, Simmons is put through a list of montages and set-pieces meant to be like greatest hits of growing up, including rogue erections, reckless masturbation or apocalyptic zits.
  Negative
But with whatever commitment Simmons offers these scenes they always head into the same punchline that theyre happening to a clueless, helpless adult.
  Negative
When Peters squeaky voice is the focus of a radio interview segment about his book, you can imagine how that scene plays out.
  Negative
Though the extensive supporting cast makes for a loaded poster, the results are disappointing.
  Negative
Brittany Snow is relegated to the love interest who also likes to cook'  Kumail Nanjiani and  Beck Bennett play Simmons far more sexually advanced friends, who offer banter about guy time or watching  Valkyrie thats well below their comedic potential'  Maria Bello plays Peter's mother, whose open sexual dialogue with Peter makes for tired hippie jokes.
  Negative
Even theappearance of  Jane Lynch as Peters boss is more of a cruel reminder of how much more efficiently  The -Year-Old Virgin did what The Late Bloomer wishes it could.
  Negative
Cameos reveal the movie's cheap taste: model Charlotte McKinney as "Attractive Woman" appears in the beginning to simply beg therapist Peter for a sex act, which is then appropriately book-ended by a climactic, heavily-anticipated cameo from tacky TV chef Bobby Flay.Really, its about the fragments that Pollak gets from his wasted, massive cast, like the image of Oscar-winner J.K. Simmons simulating intercourse using a sausage and a bagel with a smile on his face.
  Negative
The Late Bloomers script was written by five dudes, which doesnt including an additional story by credit for a sixth man, or Baker himself.
  Negative
With all of that testosterone and experience put into an -minute script, there is a staggering, disturbing amount of team effort to assemble a generic raunchy comedy with no new jokes or statements about manhood.
  Negative
If youre going with the  Broken Lizard or B-grade  Judd Apatow aesthetic, at least give us a fresh, goofy visual inspired by the gross chaos of adult adolescence.
  Positive
Mentioning prolific Tinder hook-ups, as it so hiply does when Peter belatedly realizes that he can have sex instead of just masturbating, ain't enough.
  Negative
The best that the five-plus writers can come up with is a sappy third-act revelation involving Peter learning the difference between acting like a man and being a man.
  Positive
Its typical lazy gobbledygook for a movie that wants viewers to fondly laugh about surviving puberty, but is more concerned with horniness than cleverness.
  Negative
