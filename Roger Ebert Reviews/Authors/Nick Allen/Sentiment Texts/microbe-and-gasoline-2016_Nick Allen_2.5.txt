A personal venture that could also be called  Michel Gondry: Origins, Microbe and Gasoline takes place in a cloudy, slow world before creativity blossomed and brought the fast-paced mechanics of the directors films  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,  Be Kind Rewind, etc.
  Negative
The setting is Versailles, France where Gondry grew up and its DIY narrative spark is primitive: two young men want to get away from their oppressors bullies, parents, emasculating girls, so they build a makeshift car that looks like a tiny home, as powered by an old lawnmower engine.
  Negative
When school gets out at the end of the year, they skip town and find the adventure they did not expect.
  Negative
Imagination is put into action as Gondry explores themes that have interested him in films as variegated as " The Green Hornet" or " Mood Indigo": friendship, innocence, creativity, with even more visual restraint than his high schoolers-on-the-bus, slice-of-life-in- drama  The We and the I. Curiously enough, the result here is more like a creative exercise than a direct look into the soul of an albeit fascinating filmmaker.
  Positive
The film's title teenagers are like two halves of Gondrys brain.
  Negative
Ange Dargents Daniel AKA Microbe for his small size is a budding painter, who creates images of his brothers punk friends, capturing subcultures with an innocent eye not unlike Gondrys career as a music video director.
  Positive
Meanwhile, Microbes friend Tho  Thophile Baquet AKA Gasoline is the outsider, who has an imagination both mechanical and self-amusing, riding around school on a bicycle suited up with various sound boxes, to produce sounds of a crowd cheering, or a motorcycle engine.
  Negative
Hes the inventive, extroverted side of Gondry he looks at junk as instruments for creativity, and wants to be an entertainer to his classmates.
  Negative
Along with their defining hair Microbes long hair that gets him mistaken for a girl, Gasolines wild black bush on his head Dargent and Baquet provide vivid ideas of developing adults finding their place in the world.
  Positive
With a restrained, shy performance, Dargent presents a young man who often battles emasculation, and can only run away from his problems' the larger-than-life Baquet shows Gasoline as someone who wants to transcend his proud eccentricities to be a crowd pleaser, which is especially hard in an environment of conformity.
  Negative
These sensitivities also make the road trips dynamics less predictable, as they go from loving to hating each other and back again.
  Negative
Best of all, they express how while Gondry might have innocence as a foundation for many of his characters across films, he isnt too sentimental to know that kids can be assholes, and the world can bite back the film takes place from their perspective, so worried parents including Microbe's depressed mother, played meekly by  Audrey Tautou are an afterthought, despite some extreme consequences they meet at the end.
  Negative
Motivation, or lack of it, has always been a strange gear to Gondrys narratives.
  Negative
His plots are often put into action just because, and like the logic behind his papier-mch production design and stop-motion animation, the question of Why?
  Negative
is often answered with another Why not?
  Negative
For the less-flashy but even more experimental Microbe and Gasoline, Gondry only gets so far before hes dragging viewers with him.
  Negative
The road trips strange course of events, which primarily use happenstance, is far less poignant than it is freewheeling.
  Negative
Supporting characters unexpectedly return, irony has a huge part, even Microbe becomes self-aware that he was just in an ellipsis edit.
  Negative
But it all plays out like a cartoon in slow motion' Gondry's self-amusement here with character and story proves fleeting for everyone else but him.
  Negative
While Gondry calms his creative instincts to toy with the ordinary, he indirectly errs on making "Microbe and Gasoline" his first forgettable film.
  Negative
