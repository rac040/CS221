Like all great films that nudge the world toward being a slightly more compassionate place, the creation of Menashe is an act of empathy.
  Positive
Co-writerdirector  Joshua Z. Weinsteins film achieves this initially by putting a soulful gaze on a world we rarely see in American film, the Hasidic community of New York City, using non-actors who speak entirely in Yiddish.
  Positive
But the emotional focus is what makes the film so incredibly special.
  Positive
Here is a film dedicated to recognizing our most common obstacles, its quiet storytelling largely accompanied by those feelings at the bottom of anyones gut: guilt, shame, defeat.
  Negative
"Menashe" is a gorgeous ode to everyone's inner screw-up.
  Positive
Those reactions come from observing the life of Menashe  Menashe Lustig, our hero and our tragedy.
  Negative
His wife has recently died, his son Rieven  Ruben Niborski has been placed into the care of his brother Eizik  Yoel Weisshaus, and he keeps screwing up at his job at a local food store.
  Very negative
Menashe is a direct opposite of what his rabbi, The Ruv  Meyer Schwartz says that the Talmud indicates any good man should have: A good wife, a good home, nice dishes.
  Positive
Stubborn yet prideful, he is desperate to prove to his peers that he is fit to take care of his son, despite being a widower, something that they essentially hold against him.
  Negative
But he keeps screwing up, with some problems the cause of his own foolhardy nature or nearsightedness, and others are less so.
  Negative
He slams back and forth between two Yiddish terms: a schlemiel inept and a schlimazel unlucky.
  Negative
Everyone is going through their own stuff, as we should always try to remember, and Menashe looks deep into that ideology of compassion.
  Negative
Menashe looks a bit insane compared to his peers, not just in that he doesnt wear the traditional hat and coat like other men, but that hes a black sheep in every responsibility, as a father, a worker, as a person in his community.
  Negative
As the story moves, Menashe tries to take control of his roles, getting custody of his son for a week, but he also doesnt think straight with his actions, for whatever reason.
  Negative
In one gently heartbreaking moment, he ruins a shipment of gefilte fish, while trying to squeeze in time with his son at work, because he forgot to shut the vans back doors.
  Negative
Throughout moments like this, the film asks: How much of this is rotten luck?
  Negative
Or, even larger: How truly helpless are we, when faced with things that make our days worse?
  Negative
Weinstein captures Menashes turmoil with utmost sincerity and stunning control.
  Very positive
Adding to its neorealist flavor, intimate cinematography places us in Menashe's cramped apartment, where he can only feed his son soda and cake for breakfast or in the middle of his tense meetings with The Ruv.
  Negative
And every now and then, a moment of meditation is offered by a gorgeous melodic motif from a score credited to Aaron Martin and Daq Rosenqvist, inhaling and exhaling with just a few notes.
  Positive
Rarely has ordinary clumsiness been treated with such heart or beauty.
  Positive
But the profound effect of Menashe comes in large part from its title performer, Menashe Lustig.It's the type of non-actor performance that directors dream about when they risk their narrative on someone with no previous IMDb credits, where natural line-reading blends with the sharing of someone's fascinating, true perspective.
  Positive
You see him, you recognize him, you forget you are watching someone pretend.
  Negative
The way that Weinstein works with Lustig is vital too, carefully doling out emotional moments and not pushing for reactions after something disheartening happens to his character.
  Negative
With its performance and direction in particular, Menashe is sublimely delicate.
  Positive
Like  Moonlight before it, Menashe makes an incredible case that the specific is universal, and that stories shouldn't compromise perspective for a wide audience to get it.
  Positive
With this film, the focus is incredibly specific on different Hasidic traditions and communal expectations, but the low-key emotions that fill each scene require no explanation.Weinstein also intentionally withholds details about the various ceremonies or gestures experienced in Menashes world, but it only opens his world up naturally.
  Neutral
You can fill in the specifics later by looking it up, or asking a friend.
  Neutral
Menashe is tenderly paced and expressed, though it is also tense in its own way.
  Positive
And yet while the movie is full of a characters stress, it is not dominated by that feeling like so many other movies that show people squirming through the worst days of their lives.
  Negative
Instead, Menashe transcends its anxieties and becomes wholly comforting, like the closest that art can come to offering a big hug.
  Positive
What an extraordinary feeling to watch a movie that essentially wraps its arms around you and says, Its okay, buddy.
  Positive
Weve all been there.
  Neutral
