  Negative
Thirty minutes in, and thats just the start of when The Ornithologist changes from its unassuming nature into something thats truly gripping, an introspective nature movie about Man vs. Earth as much as Man vs. Man.
  Positive
As it becomes surrealist, the story is propelled in particular by spirituality.
  Positive
The scripts interactions become allegorical in Fernandos different chapters with people, such as the missionaries, or a deaf young man who is laying out in the sun naked with his goats, or a group of naked women in the woods who ride horses and carry weapons.

  Positive
As the story goes on, he's compelling to watch navigate this world, with the sound design of rushing water or shots of birds flying through the air dominating the senses.
  Positive

  Positive
This is a movie well worth seeing on the big screen, and also worth its almost two-hour, contemplative running time time.
  Very positive
Comprised of picturesque wide shots and various images that sometimes show Fernando and the humans from an animals point of view, "The Ornithologist" vividly recalls the creation of a  Transformers movie its scope is a series of various, massive location shots, but instead of filling them with CGI robots, it is humans who stick out as unnatural, secondary.
  Negative
And any time Fernando explores a location like a fort or abandoned tunnel, or sees a piece of his broken boat wedged into a campfire, all that is manmade looks just a bit uglier.
  Negative
The effect is both immersive for the world and luminous to the soul of Rodrigues film, which reminds us how nature seems to function well enough without human beings and our unnatural technology or our gods.
  Very positive
Whether we're trying to make sense of the world by worshiping a higher being or merely just watching from a distance, we are all just renting the space.
