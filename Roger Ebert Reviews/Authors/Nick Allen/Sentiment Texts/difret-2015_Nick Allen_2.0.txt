  Negative

  Negative

  Negative
He locks her up in a shed, and rapes her.
  Positive
The next morning, Hirut escapes, but when she's cornered again she ends up shooting Tabele with his rifle in self-defense.
  Negative
Shes arrested, and everyone the villagers and the corrupt men in the government wants her to be tried as an adult, with their eye on the death penalty.
  Negative
Standing up to this crazed patriarchy is lawyer Meaza Ashenafi played stoically by  Meron Getnet, who specifically provides free legal help to women who rarely have a voice in the courtroom.
  Positive
Along with doing everything she can to get Hirut a fair self-defense trial,Meaza ends up housing the young woman.
  Negative
This makes for a few touching moments in which Hirut gets to know a woman first-hand who pursued education, and eschewed expectations of matrimony and motherhood because of it.
  Neutral
Along with a parallel scene in which the fathers of Hirut and Tabele argue about who is the victim, these scenes highlight the culture clash within the story, which could be far more interesting if writerdirector Zeresenay Berhane M ehari dared to dig deeper into its true-life inspirations.
  Negative
Mehari was born in Ethiopia, but moved to America to study film at USC.
  Positive
For his first feature, he mixes feminist courtroom drama and a coming-of-age story in which a young woman understands the world outside her village, but fails to solidify either of these narratives.
  Negative
"Difret" does indeed play like a first movie made by someone who can list the common ingredients in popular storytelling, but is still working on a distinct vision.
  Negative
It leans on the simpler narrative tools, like in how the sleazy district attorney dresses like hes going to a club, or how characters ask expository dialogue every few minutes.
  Negative
Theres also some novice cinematography work, in which exposures prove an issue, leaving faces completely opaque as consistent use of nonetheless beautiful natural light proves counterproductive.
  Positive
Meharis presentation proves far too straightforward.
  Negative
There is little motivating the dramatic urgency aside from covering each development, despite the social issues that make the story itself so immediate.
  Negative
As Difret is more a collection of Meaza's gutsy moves in her fight against the system, Mehari at least turns some of these segments into a necessary confrontation.
  Negative
Freedom is a given right for all citizens.
  Neutral
Yes, including women,  states Getnet, staring back at us in agripping close-up, speaking far beyond just the Ethiopian judicial system.
  Negative
Despite its central location on the battle between ingrained beliefs and what is legally right, Difret doesnt have the vision to get deep into its culture clash, instead choosing to be a one-dimensional hero piece.
  Negative
The film has a great true story that should be told, but it shortchanges the psychological aspect of progress, in which courageous actions and convincing words influence others to think differently.
  Positive
"Difret" doesnt show how a great change is made, simply that it was.
  Positive
