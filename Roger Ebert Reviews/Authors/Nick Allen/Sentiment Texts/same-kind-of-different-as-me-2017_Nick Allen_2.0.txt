Same Kind of Different as Me is a top nominee for the Nice Movie of , in that it just wants to exist and be kind when not trying to extract tears from its audience like test subjects.
  Positive
Spiritually, it feels relatively tame compared to other religious movies, as it doesnt proclaim that Heaven is For Real or Gods Not Dead, but it does use the Bible as a moral compass on its bland journey of selflessness.
  Negative
Its biggest risk is that it might alienate members of the KKK, but in this climate the films producers might think thats ballsy enough.
  Negative
Based on the bestselling book, which inspired both a sequel and a childrens adaptation, Same Kind of Different as Me is the true story of a wealthy Texas white couple, Ron and Debbie  Greg Kinnear and  Renee Zellweger, who befriend a violent homeless man  Djimon Hounsou.
  Negative
He calls himself Suicide, but is actually named Denver.
  Positive
Debut co-writerdirector  Michael Carney doesnt have much of an eye for any of this saga, which includes a Blind Side-like narrative that transitions into a weepy sickness tale fit for  Nicholas Sparks that I wont spoil, but the true story aspect is a type of preservation itself.
  Negative
It can be hard to disagree with the heart and events of this truetale, except for when the movie reveals itself to be mighty self-congratulatory.
  Negative
The book, which features the voices of Ron and Denver as organized by their co-author  Lynn Vincent, makes a point of starting with Denvers narration before then going to Ron, as Denver sharesa horrifying racistepisode from his youth thats featured in the middle of thefilm.
  Negative
But instead of feeling like the story belongs to both men, this movie is told from Rons perspective, framed as the tale of aTexas art dealer who knew a great woman who helped introduce him to a sidekick.
  Positive
Ron is brought into the world of taking care of homeless people as a type of penance after Debbie catches him cheating' she takes him to a shelter in a less-loved part of Fort Worth, which leads to a lot of plainly nice scenes in which Debbie andor Ron interact with homeless people, treat them like human beings.
  Positive
One night, Debbie dreams of walking through a field and seeing a black man, the type of straight-faced narrative detail that proves to be a big deal in a movie like this.
  Positive
That mental imagesoon barrels into the movie in the form of Suicide, literally with a baseball bat in hand as he tears up the homeless shelter's cafeteria.
  Negative
Scene-by-scene, as Ron amp' Debbie reach out to him by acknowledging him and feeding him, the intense man loses the thick exteriors and offers perfect wisdom after perfect wisdom.
  Negative
He is later welcomed into their home, and their social lives.
  Positive
We learn, through monologues accompanied by flashback, about Denver's truly unbelievable past: that he lived in Louisiana and picked cotton in what was essentiallyslavery, completely removed from the civil rights movement or any such modernity' that he was beaten by KKK members as a teenager, and later went to prison for trying to rob a bus in Shreveport.
  Negative
Hounsou's scraggly voiceshares these stories through extensive monologues as Kinnear and Zellweger listen, with Hounsou doling outprecise line-readingand tears.
  Negative
True to the hollow cinematic spirit of this movie, Carney can only accompany with bland flashbacks or stubborn modern-day close-ups that soak us in Hounsous wet eyes.
  Negative
The film gives a strong juxtaposition of why Ron amp' Debbie and Denver would be unusual as friends, which makes for a sweet spot in the middle when Denver is shown hanging out with them.
  Positive
The scenes are cringeworthy to be sure, like when one of Rons peers at a country club calls Denver an amigo Negro, but the shimmer, that value of nice is prominent, as performed by three capable actors.
  Positive
In fact, in many instances, Kinnear, Zellweger and Hounsou make the production seem like it has more soul than the sappy strings, wholesale dialogue and lazy filmmaking would suggest.
  Negative
It should be said that Hounsou gives what is hands down one of the most intense performances that these modern religious blockbusters will ever see.
  Positive
Actors of all religious ideology levels, from shoulder-shrug to Uber  Kirk Cameron, find their way into these moral melodramas as mere projects, with inconsistent spiritual or artistic inspiration.
  Negative
Just look at  Jon Voight in this film, who phones in a curmudgeonly drunk performance that makes for a weak subplot about being forgiven by his son, Ron.
  Negative
But Hounsou recognizes somethingvolcanic in thischaracter a profound soul who has survived many lifetimes, alone' Hounsou believes something about this story that others do not.
  Negative
In turn, heprovides a performance with an intensity this project doesnt deserve and in turn doesn't know what to do with.
  Negative
As the story ambles along, focused most of all on heart strings, Denvers shallow purpose to the film is revealed.
  Negative
His narrative duties are limited to telling a sad story from his past, crying, and making his new friends feel all that more assured about what they have done.
  Negative
Whenever Denver offers wisdom, including a perfect speech at the end where this movie gets its title, and then takes a spot to the side,his handling gets all the more tedious.
  Positive
While there is a fascinating story within here of an unlikely connection between a married couple and Denver, Same Kind of Different as Me would rather make it specifically and obnoxiously about the selfless, magical white people and the human being who benefited from their kindness.
  Negative
Its worse enough that the story dulls down the spirit of Ron and Debbie' its even more gross how high the story tries to prop up Denver.
  Very negative
