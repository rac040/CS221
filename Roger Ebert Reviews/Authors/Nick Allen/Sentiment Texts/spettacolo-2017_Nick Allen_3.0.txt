Tucked away in the hills of Tuscany, the small village of Monticchello puts on an original play every year, starring its residents, working from material inspired by their current anxieties and passions.
  Negative
Theyve been doing this for  years, but no one has offered an in-depth look until filmmakers  Jeff Malmberg and  Chris Shellen "Marwencol".
  Negative
As their production is documented rehearsal by rehearsal, Spettacolo is not a type of Charlie Kaufman-esque enterprise like a real-life Synecdoche, NY, but it is a touching document of seemingly regular people who yearn to keep an artistic tradition alive.
  Positive
The history of the Teatro Povero di Monticchello is presented through an impressive amount of archival material.
  Positive
Photo negatives, footage and modern interviews loop us into the history of this town theater, which is indeed fascinating.
  Positive
It all started, in part, when the town famously protected partisan soldiers against fascists, and were almost executed until an officer let them go.
  Negative
Years later, they would start putting on theatrical productions that were period pieces, but then opted for modern, meta pieces, or autodramas, where their current mindsets would be out on stage.
  Negative
They had reoccurring actors, like Alpo, Edna, and Arturo' a curious man with flowing hair named Andrea would go from becoming an actor to the director and writer, approaching each play with the seriousness of Broadway.
  Negative
You can tell from the contents of this archival material the various sets, the strange costumes, the raucous scenes how the theater became a town-wide pride and expression.
  Negative
When Malmberg and Stellen arrive to make this film, however, the place is much different.
  Negative
A third of the cast members are dead and the next generation do not seem all that interested in the production.
  Negative
And yet there is a spirit to keep going, especially as they hook onto a scenario that speaks to their current anxieties: economic dominance as Monticchello becomes filled with tourism, killing the way of life they have known.
  Negative
The play they settle on concerns the end of the world, with greedy banks buying up the land.
  Negative
A main problem, or prominent factor for this albeit well-made documentary, is timing.
  Positive
This detailed idea of what was also creates a nagging idea of what this could have been if someone were to have made a film about all of it decades ago.
  Positive
No points are taken away for that instilled curiosity, but it certainly changes how the documentary functions and plays out, especially with the theaters best production happening years ago.
  Positive
Spettacolo is about the past, the wilting present and questionable future of this long tradition, and is best approached as an elegy to a tradition we are just starting to appreciate.
  Positive
Malmberg and Shellen learned Italian for the project and moved to Monticchello, which explains in large part how this story feels so intimate.
  Positive
As it observes people quietly and shares the history of the play, it feels like a project made from the inside but for a public audience, much like the theatrical productions themselves.
  Negative
When tourists are presented in the film, with their loud rolling luggage tearing through the peaceful landscape of Monticchello, their presence in turn feels entirely alien, unwelcome.
  Negative
Using the simple beauty of their setting their amicable subjects, Malmberg and Shellen make a great case for how tourism will truly be the end of the world.
  Positive
The embedded nature of the film informs the often breathless beauty in its cinematography, which is often shown for a few seconds in montages accompanied by string quartet classical music.
  Neutral
The sights are plain but quite effective: two men talking on a bench about how one-third of the original actors have died, a woman doing her laundry on a fence while a gorgeous set of hills sits in the background without a single tourist bus on it.
  Negative
"Spettacolo" does more than put a spotlight to this incredible tradition, it captures a way of life for a very non-theatrical group of people.
  Positive
With this project, Malmberg and Shellen are clearly just as interested in the production as they are in the people there.
  Negative
When they show the play being rehearsed, they focus on the faces of those watching just as much as the content thats on the stage.
  Negative
Spettacolo in turn feels broad with its desire to people-watch and sum up a towns entire theatrical history, but it touches enough upon arts ability to imitate life and vice versa.
  Negative
Its a charming look at a group of people and fading tradition we may not have heard about otherwise, and clues us into how they create their sense of community.
  Positive
