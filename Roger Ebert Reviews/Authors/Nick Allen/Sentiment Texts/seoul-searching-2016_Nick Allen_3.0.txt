  Negative
His big heart guides us through coming-of-age experiences both specific and universal, with a film that wants to be John Hughes-like  la its " The Breakfast Club" poster but can be parallel to  Spike Lees  School Daze in how it tackles race and identity with a burgeoning cinematic vision.
  Positive
The initial hook of Seoul Searching is its most polarizing and brilliant artistic stroke.
  Positive
Its characters are dressed to their identities like uniforms, having an exaggerated presence.
  Negative
For example, Justin Chon's Sid Park is the Korean-American Punk," dressed with a spiky hair, a reoccurring cigarette and a shredded Black Flag tee'  Jessika Vans Grace Park wears crucifix earrings, sunglasses and black tights, taking her background as a pastors daughter to the umpteenth Madonna level.
  Negative
Lee introduces these characters a scene-stealing trio of RUN DMC lookalikes, Byul Kang's tomboy, Teo Yoo's German-Korean man and Esteban Ahn's Latin-Korean man, among others like runway models as they exit the airport terminal, captured with his constant wide angle lens to look larger than life.
  Negative
They create a mix of characters that pops just like the movies candy store color palette, illustrating the intense nature of identity.
  Neutral
What might seem like a visual gimmick during the film's early, charming episodes of teen shenanigans drinking, sneaking up to the girls quarters or out to clubs soon establishes itself as high concept, especially as some of them confront the insecurities behind their daily costumes.
  Positive
The answer is often within their backgrounds, concerning their tension with their Korean-born parents, or the pressures within the social circles they cling to back home.
  Positive
With an exciting roster of young actors, the films performances match these images with full-body effect, like the way militarized Mike  Albert Kong speaks, walks and sneers like a -year-old drill sergeant.
  Positive
A costume ball in the third act adds a beautiful poignancy, as the students all change their appearances to show how fluid identity can be, but that it starts with a personal choice.
  Positive
When Sid asks Mike about why hes the way he is, he replies with a background of being the only Korean-American in his environment: I have to be this way ... I won't survive otherwise.
  Negative
Seoul Searching is unforgettable in how it boldly presents adolescence, specifically here from a minority's perspective, not just as a life passage, but a type of performance.
  Positive
What Lee does with these characters is always more inspired than it is tight, as it breaks off into different mini-arcs with Koreas generational divide as his blanket statement.
  Negative
The schooling angle of the film leads to some direct conversations about what it means to be Korean, but the out-of-school dramatic moments touch upon something beyond history or language.
  Positive
Lee's story often hits emotional climaxes with over-zealous waterworks, but his best story involves a young woman whose "type" is that shes adopted, who meets her biological Korean mother.
  Positive
In their two scenes, they can't communicate with language, only through intense emotion the daughters calm, mournful tone , responded to with a mother's billowing, muted shame  creating an extraordinary and tender parent-child moment that is the best John Hughes-like quality of Lees film.
  Negative
Coming directly from Lees perspective, the movie has a discouraging blind spot for half of its cast.
  Negative
For a story that often explores the cross-generational damage done by the standards of masculinity that Korean men can hold themselves to, Seoul Searching often introduces women with close-up butt shots, and later even gives Graces Madonna character an a cappella and dance performance of "Like a Virgin" with questionable agency.
  Negative
As Lee's movie takes a huge stride away from horrifying Asian caricatures like Long Duk Dong in Hughes' " Sixteen Candles," the need for more progress remains  obvious.
  Negative
The episodic narrative of "Seoul Searching" can be too long and unfocused, but its stubbornness comes from filmmaking that is overflowing with self-pride.
  Negative
Lee says in the press notes that this film is one that Ive yearned to see all my life," and that could be its entire plot synopsis.
  Negative
For people of whatever background or social designation, who will watch Lees movie and identify with new reflections of themselves, the power of that pride can never be underestimated.
