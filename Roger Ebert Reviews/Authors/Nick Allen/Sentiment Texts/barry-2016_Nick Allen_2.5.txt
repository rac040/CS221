A common image of President  Barack Obama in Netflix's "Barry" is that of a quiet young man, cigarette often in hand, looking towards something or reading.
  Positive
Hes always thinking.
  Positive
But as much as director Vikram Gandhi's film is motivated by presenting a young Barack Obama as a vessel for different conversations of identity, race and what defines an American, its scant narrative eloquence limits those ideas to mere food for thought.
  Negative
Devon Terrell's performance as Barry is warm, always leading with empathy and a genuine smile.
  Very positive
But theres an air of perfection that constantly threatens to dehumanize Barry' the biggest flaw he has in the film, Im pretty certain, is that he carries an open beer around campus.
  Negative
Barry devolves into a protective tale of a genius, the story of how a person become a genius of the people.
  Positive
And yet we dont need a perfect depiction or vision of genius for President Obama.
  Positive
As Ta-Nehisi Coates pointed out recently on The Daily Show regarding what Obama had to do to become president, he had to be scholarly, intelligent, president of Harvard Law Review ... the product of some of our greatest educational institutions.
  Negative
For a human being who had to achieve so much through tried-and-true intellect, making him into a symbol doesnt best serve his origin story.
  Positive
Not a lot happens in this non-biopic of President Obama, and thats fine.
  Negative
Adam Mansbachs script resists putting Barry on a narrative quest other than self-discovery, which concerns him finding his place, as a young black man, in the world.
  Negative
He interacts with different people, who provide perspective outside of the voice in his head.
  Positive
He has a girlfriend, Charlotte  Anya Taylor-Joy of  The Witch, who tries to understand him personally, even connecting with him by saying that she spent five days in Kenya once.
  Negative
Later, while playing basketball, he meets PJ  Jason Mitchell of  Straight Outta Compton, who provides Barry with a look at the projects while sharing his own hustle, which will lead towards a lucrative, corporate job.
  Negative
Barry's friends Saleem  Avi Nash and Will  Ellar Coltrane provide different ideas of how young, idealistic people try to connect with others.
  Negative
None of these supporting characters are particularly well-defined, despite the clear heart in each performance.
  Negative
Gandhis filmmaking, his first time for a feature after examining fake icons with the gripping doc Kumar, starts off with promise.
  Positive
I loved a righteously angry edit to the next scene after a white student asks Barry during a class debate, Why is it always about slavery?
  Negative
, not dignifying that with a response.
  Neutral
But the script constantly undermines its potential, like a big scene at the end where Barry is shown at a very white wedding talking to two guests who are older, established and brilliant people of color.
  Negative
Their advice for him is hammy, however important, and the two are treated with an uncomfortable sense of being capital-S Special.
  Very negative
Not because they are the only minorities invited to the wedding, but what they represent for the script.
  Negative
There are moments in which Barry gets across what it wants to elucidate, and one involves Barry getting a mini tour from PJ in the projects before a party PJ calls it Projects Safari.
  Positive
You can tell that Gandhi really cares about this scene as he shoots it with an extended Steadicam shot, but that isnt what makes it memorable.
  Neutral
Taken up the grimy stairs and down the ghostly hall of the apartment building, Barry is presented ideas of class and race he doesnt see in his university bubble, with PJ ending the tour with the poignant statement of This is what the government did to us.
  Positive
The scene concludes later, with Barry leaving the party, saying This aint my scene.
  Negative
That line means much more than just his take on party culture, and its a type of delicacy the scripts dialogue could benefit more from.
  Positive
Overwritten in spite of its many quiet moments, Barry is a movie that can make you appreciate tactful cultural references in biopics.
  Positive
Every book title mentioned, or even a viewing of Black Orpheus with his mother  Ashley Judd, is delivered with heavy hands.
  Negative
Worst example: Barry is seen reading Invisible Man on the basketball court and earns the nickname Invisible from PJ.
  Negative
Later on, a book vendor on the street remarks about the book, We been waiting on a sequel for a long time.
  Negative
This is that kind of true story script, where every reference or interaction is overly considered.
  Positive
When watching Barry, its impossible to not think about this years Southside with You, which imagined Barack Obama and Michelle Robinson on their first date, in a Richard Linklater-esque walk amp' talk slice of life.
  Negative
As the dark clouds of an inauguration draw near, the two films now play like eulogies for Obamas progressive presidency.
  Negative
And though theyre two completely different projects, they share the same motive: to not be Obama biopics but express moments in time of this all-American icon, zeroing in on the values that led to his two-time election and historic time in office.
  Negative
The problem with Barry is that it hardly passes the test that Southside with You excels at, which is being a prologue that can exist without the context of the epilogue.
  Negative
Watching Gandhi's film, which seeks to ground him as a guy who never goes by Barack, who likes to dance, smoke, play basketball and might do something important one day, the films inability to become a statement of its own constantly has us remembering how it all ends.
  Very negative
