Expectations can be a burden, and Happy New Year is heavy laden: director  Farah Khan and leading man  Shahrukh Khan no relation have made two prior features, 's Main Hoon Na and 's Om Shanti Om, that fall anywhere between a lot of fun and all-time classic depending on whom one asks, and there are plenty of people one can ask, as both films were enormously popular.
  Negative
Not to mention, Farah's choreography kept Shahrukh from falling off the top of a train in Dil Se.
  Negative
For Western audiences unfamiliar with these titles, suffice to say, this director-star duo's reunion is A Very Big Deal.
  Positive
And, as if that wasn't enough, they've been developing, to some degree or other, Happy New Year for almost a decade.
  Negative
While a compelling argument that expecting another Om Shanti Om or a work of similarly awe-inspiring scale is setting the bar unfairly high, even resetting all factors to neutral, Happy New Year would be a mysteriously sloppy piece of work.
  Negative
Its premise is a tantalizing one given the director's immense skill as a choreographer and visual stylist and deft hand with comedy.
  Very positive
The son of a convicted thief assembles a team to exact revenge against the sinister tycoon who framed the father by stealing a set of invaluable diamonds, which requires that the avengers enter a dance competition.
  Negative
The execution of that premise is extremely erratic' there are few movies in living memory that ricochet between shockingly offensive comic business and utterly disarming hilarity as drastically as this one.
  Negative
It's that mercurial aspect to the comedy that causes hesitation before branding it outright as homophobic or racist.
  Negative
There are mean-spirited straight male gay panic gags side by side with awkward but clearly affectionate normalizing of gay desire.
  Negative
There are truly shocking moments of racism toward East Asians including a they all look alike joke that, although scorned by another character on-screen, is still a they all look alike joke in , side by side with a whole subplot about Shahrukh showing how progressive he is by being nice to a North Korean kid.
  Negative
Almost the entire first half of the movie, until the intermission, is a bit of a disaster.
  Negative
The second half, featuring more dancing and the fruition of the heist plot, is a good deal more fun.
  Positive
The heist sequences are tensely staged, goofily over-the-top convolution in the spirit of  Ocean's Eleven or Shahrukh Khan's own Don remake and sequel, defying logic and even rational linearity at every turn, and quite fun.
  Negative
But it's the dance sequences, featuring cortex-melting costume design and Farah Khan choreography it's not her best work, but even a slightly off-her-game Farah Khan towers over mere mortals go a long way toward making the whole enterprise worthwhile.
  Negative
That the sum total of the enterprise is a bunch of movie stars goofing off and dancing a bit shouldn't serve entirely as a dismissal.
  Negative
Abshishek Bachchan is a surprising standout in a dual role as the villain's layabout son complete with blue contact lenses and a hilariously on-point American accent and the out-of-control drunk the good guys recruit because he's a dead ringer.
  Positive
Often a fatally stiff actor and atrocious dancer, Bachchan seems like someone opened his physical comedy valve here, giving his loosest, funniest performance in years, if not ever.
  Negative
And as for his dancing, well, the whole point is that the heroes are bad dancers here.
  Negative
Deepika Padukone's role as the professional brought in to whip them into shape is lamentably small and undemanding' hiring a star of her caliber for a role this undemanding is overkill.
  Negative
But that's one of Happy New Year's principal reasons for being: everyone in the movie is a star.
  Positive
This is not, to put it mildly, Shahrukh Khan operating at the peak of his powers.
  Negative
That Padukone quotes one of his better moments a motivational speech he delivered to the girl's field hockey team he coached in Chak De!
  Negative
India with the genders flipped, before cutting to an annoyed reaction shot from SRK, says a lot about the movie as a whole.
  Negative
That and other callbacks to his previous glories merely highlight the degree to which he's on autopilot for much of the film here.
  Negative
But, as with the director, even sub-peak SRK is better than most.
  Negative
Where this differs is that there are a bunch of other movie stars visibly trying a lot harder right there in the same scenes with him.
  Negative
If Happy New Year inspires anyone to check out Main Hoon Na or Om Shanti Om, it will count as a success on that ground alone.
  Positive
On its own merits, it has some wildly fun dance sequences, some funny bits, and an impressive roster of mainstream Bollywood talent.
  Positive
It's a shame that those positives can't entirely outweigh the messy, lazy and dumb stuff that pads out the remainder of the running time.
  Negative
