Just before the commencement of the screening of the new horror film "The Lazarus Effect" that I was attending, a woman entered the theater with two small children maybe  and  years of age tops.
  Negative
Under normal circumstances, such a spot-on parenting choice would lead to the kids screaming and yelling in response to all the nasty imagery and blaring sound effects emanating from the screen.
  Negative
However, I don't recall hearing a single peep from either of them at any point during the screening despite all the on-screen atrocities.
  Neutral
From this, I can conclude one of two things either kids today are even more jaded than previously suspected or, more likely, "The Lazarus Effect" is such a limp excuse for a horror movie that it cannot even get a rise out of a couple of kids out past their bedtime on a school night.
  Negative
The film is yet another riff on the old chestnut of arrogant scientists who discover the secret to bringing the dead back to life and discover to their amazement that it is not all that it is cracked up to be.
  Negative
Our tamperers in God's domain this time around are Frank  Mark Duplass and Zoe  Olivia Wilde, a couple of researchers at a California university who are developing a serum that could help revive the dead.
  Negative
With their team computer ace Niko Donald Glover, stoner brainiac Clay  Evan Peters and Ava  Sarah Bolger, the cute newcomer who exists solely so that the other characters can explain things at length to her and the audience that they presumably already know they manage to revive a dead dog.
  Negative
Inevitably, the dog doesn't seem quite right afterwards and one character remarks that it might end up going Cujo on them, presumably because referring to the far more apt "Pet Sematary" might have seemed a little too on the nose for comfort.
  Negative
Through circumstances too idiotic to go into here, the group has all their research taken over by a biotech firm and they are shut out of their own project.
  Negative
In an effort to prove that this work was theirs, they sneak back into the labs one night in order to replicate the experiment.
  Negative
Alas, it all goes higgledy-piggledy and Zoe winds up electrocuted.
  Negative
Remembering his vow as a mad movie scientist to first always do harm, the grieving Frank decides to zap her with the serum and bring her back.
  Negative
Again, it works but things are not entirely right with her either as she begins utilizing  of her brain's functions to develop strange powers such as telekinesis, the ability to pull the others into her memories of a barely-buried childhood trauma and the habit of knowing exactly what everyone else is about to say.
  Negative
Now trapped inside the lab, the others find themselves being picked off one by one in grisly though not grisly enough to violate the PG- rating fashion while trying desperately to figure out a way to put a stop to what they have wrought before there can be the requisite final scene designed to set up a sequel.
  Negative
If you think the above description was boring, trite and predictable, try sitting through it as it is unfolding.
  Negative
This isn't a real horror movie this is the kind of horror movie that the characters in a real horror movie watch in order to comment on the lameness of the genre before their authentic terrors begin.
  Negative
The screenplay by  Luke Dawson and  Jeremy Slater is a pastiche of elements cribbed from other films ranging from "Frankenstein" to " Flatliners" to, oddly enough, last summer's action hit " Lucy."
  Negative
To be fair, the latter is more of a coincidence since the film has apparently been sitting on a shelf since .
  Negative
The scares are almost entirely of the cheapo "BOO!"
  Neutral
moments where someone unexpectedly pops into the frame for a quick jolt' while these can be effective when used sparingly, the film proceeds to run the technique into the ground in the first  minutes and then continues on with it.
  Neutral
Meanwhile, the one surefire shock in a film of this sort the bit where something thought to be lifeless is lying under a sheet and suddenly sits up is handled so badly that the only screams are ones of frustration.
  Negative
To top things off, the entire thing is shot in such darkness that the mere act of looking at it becomes a chore that is hardly worth the effort.
  Negative
Walking out of "The Lazarus Effect," the only question I had is why so many talented people signed on for a project that by all rights is the kind of thing generally made by complete unknowns who then fervently try to deny its existence if they wind up making it big sometime down the line.
  Negative
Okay, I guess I can kind of understand why Olivia Wilde might have done it--after all, she gets to bark, drool, sleep four feet above the covers and deliver the immortal line "Did I just die?"
  Negative
in what may have struck her like an exceptionally loony episode of "House."
  Negative
However, that doesn't explain why talents like Duplass, Glover and Bolger would waste their time on such nothing roles.
  Neutral
Even the director,  David Gelb, has a better pedigree than one might expect: although this is his first narrative feature, he made a splash a couple of years ago with the hit documentary " Jiro Dreams of Sushi."
  Negative
He even gives an apparent shout-out to that previous effort in one scene in which he has Wilde eating a plate of sushi.
  Positive
Alas, the pieces of fish on her plate come closer to demonstrating recognizable signs of life than anything else on display here.
  Neutral
