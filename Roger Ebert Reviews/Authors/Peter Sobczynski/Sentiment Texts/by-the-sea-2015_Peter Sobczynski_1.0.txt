When a big-time movie star steps behind the camera, there's often the fear that the end result will be nothing more than a vanity project that would never have been produced if made by anyone else.
  Negative
Therefore, it came as a surprise when  Angelina Jolie's first two directorial gigs, "In the Land of Blood and Honey" and "Unbroken," thoroughly bucked that trend.
  Positive
Not only did she not step in front of the cameras for either of them, they dealt with very tricky material the Bosnian War and an American soldier suffering an array of tortures in a Japanese POW camp during World War II, respectively, and they demonstrated cinematic ambition and a willingness to grapple with tough subject matter.
  Positive
Therefore, it is baffling to discover that for her third directorial effort, "By the Sea," she has produced a film that is such a borderline unendurable exercise in vapid self-indulgence that it almost feels like an exceptionally straight-faced parody of empty-headed star vehicles.
  Negative
Billed here as  Angelina Jolie Pitt for the first time, she co-stars with real-life husband  Brad Pitt as Vanessa and Roland, respectively.
  Negative
As the s-set story opens, they are driving to a remote French seaside town played by Malta for an extended stay at a local hotel with a view of the Mediterranean to die for.
  Negative
He is a novelist who had a promising career early on, but who now spends more time telling people that he is a writer than doing any actual writing.
  Negative
She used to be a dancer, but now spends her days lounging around, popping pills and acting disdainful towards practically everything that comes into her path.
  Negative
Roland and Vanessa have been married for  years, but after spending a few minutes observing them, one could hardly understand how they managed to stick it out so long.
  Negative
Frankly, the only things that seem to be keeping them together are their impossibly glamourous looks and an explanation for their marital discord they inevitably refuse to delve into until the big emotional climax.
  Negative
A distraction from their shared sense of torpor eventually arrives in the form of Lea  Mlanie Laurent and Francois  Melvil Poupaud, a young couple who arrive at the hotel for their honeymoon and end up in the room next door.
  Negative
At first, Vanessa has no interest in them or much of anything else but that begins to change when she discovers a hidden peephole in the wall that allows her to secretly observe her neighbors constantly making love or otherwise gamboling about.
  Negative
After a while, Roland too stumbles across the peephole, and before long, the two of them are watching their neighbors together even eating dinner while doing so and in them, they seem to get a glimpse of the type of couple that they used to be.
  Negative
The mutual peeping even seems to instigate a thaw in the iciness between Roland and Vanessa for a while, but it all goes bad, of course, and threatens to destroy both couples in the process.
  Very negative
This is the films one mildly intriguing concept the notion of a couple on the rocks using voyeurism as a way of regaining the attraction they once shared but it is introduced far too late in the proceedings to make much of an impact, and Jolie Pitt has no particular interest in developing it.
  Positive
Instead, she is more interested in presenting one tableau after another featuring Vanessa and Roland in various forms of ennui-ridden repose.
  Negative
The characters are beautiful bores when they are on their own and strike zero sparks when they do come together to tear into each other.
  Positive
Early on, we quickly realize that like the film as a whole, there is precious little to these two beneath their glossy exteriors, and nothing that occurs over the next two interminable hours comes close to suggesting anything else of substance to them.
  Negative
As for the aforementioned big revelation, the explanation for their angst is so trite and generic that it comes across as more insulting than devastating.
  Negative
This is the first time that Jolie Pitt has directed herself in a film and let it be said that the actress does the director no favors here.
  Negative
She spends a good chunk of her screen time in a state of terminal languidness and when she does get to her feet, she staggers through the proceedings as though the entire weight of existence is resting on her slender shoulders.
  Negative
At no point, however, does she display any of the spark that once made her among the most electrifying actresses around she does, however, demonstrate that severe emotional turmoil does not have to get in the way of showing off an elaborate wardrobe and makeup regime at every available opportunity.
  Negative
Pitt comes off a little better but he is also stuck with a role that is little more than a few random notions that never coalesce into a fully fleshed-out character.
  Negative
By comparison, Laurent and Poupaud are far more interesting to be fair, however, this probably has something to do with the fact that they have actually been given stuff to do.
  Positive
By the Sea looks beautiful, thanks to the cinematography by Christian Berger, but the sleek exteriors cannot make up for the shallow storytelling.
  Neutral
I can only presume that there was something about this particular story that grabbed Jolie Pitt and inspired her to bring it to the screen, but whatever it was, she has utterly failed to convey that into terms about which viewers could possibly care.
  Negative
All we are left with is little more than a dour downer of a film that will leave most moviegoers as cold and indifferent as the characters they have been watching.
  Negative
They will want to visit Malta after seeing how it has been presented here however, if this movie is any indication of the sort of people who might turn up there, they might want to wait until the off-season.
  Negative
