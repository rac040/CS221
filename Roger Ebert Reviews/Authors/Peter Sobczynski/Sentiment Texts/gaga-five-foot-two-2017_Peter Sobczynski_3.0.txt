Gaga: Five Foot Two promises viewers a raw, warts-and-all look at the life of  Lady Gaga, who first burst onto the music scene a mere nine years ago and has been a pop culture icon ever since.
  Negative
That puts the film squarely in the tradition of two of the greatest rock music-related documentaries ever made  Bob Dylans groundbreaking Dont Look Back  and Madonnas Truth or Dare .
  Positive
Of course, those films were made in the days before the advent of the Internet and the -hour news cycle.
  Neutral
And when people went to see them, they genuinely felt as if they were getting a true behind-the-scenes look at Dylan and Madonna even though those two, in addition to being great musical talents, were both expert manipulators of the media and of their respective images.
  Positive
Although prodigiously gifted both in her musical talents and her ability to present them to audiences in creative and audacious ways, the trick for Gaga here is to convey that sense of pulling back the curtain in an era when even the smallest moves and actions are broadcast to the world via tweets, Facebook posts and shaky YouTube videos.
  Negative
The end result is a film that may not rise to the level of Dont Look Back or Truth or Dare but still manages to create a sense of intimacy and revelation, even as we sense that there is really no such thing as an unguarded moment for Lady Gaga.
  Positive
Directed by  Chris Moukarbel, who previously madethe documentary Banksy in New York, the film follows Gaga through a few especially tumultuous and active months in  that culminated with her performing before the biggest crowd of her career as the halftime entertainment at the Super Bowl last January.
  Negative
On the professional front, she is seen recording her highly personal album Joanne with producer  Mark Ronson and guest vocalist  Florence Welch of Florence amp' the Machine and planning every aspect of its release important since her last foray into pop music, Artpop, was largely considered to be a dud with the kind of precision one normally attributes to military strikes.
  Negative
At the same time she is doing this, she is also shooting a role for the Roanoke cycle of American Horror Story and being wooed by  Bradley Cooper to star in his directorial debut, a remake of A Star is Born.
  Negative
There are special performances that she delivers at the Democratic National Convention and a birthday celebration for  Tony Bennett.
  Positive
Finally, there is that Super Bowl performance, which she regards as a sort of summation of her career to date as well as being a chance to help bring together through music a deeply divided American population still reeling from the recent presidential election.
  Negative
Though Gagas life would seem to be an exceptionally charmed one, there are a few dark areas to be had as well.
  Negative
There is the break-up with fiancee  Taylor Kinney that helps to inspire some of the songs on Joanne but which is an emotional development she apparently has not quite yet gotten over.
  Negative
More significantly, there is the chronic pain that she has developed since suffering a misdiagnosed at first broken hip on her Born This Way tour three years earlier.
  Negative
Although she is often able to work through the pain with her indefatigable energy, there aremoments when we see her barely able to move as a result of what she describes as a rope of agony extending throughout her body.
  Negative
That said, this does lead to one of the most bizarrely amusing moments in the film when Gaga goes in for a medical examination and has a procedure done while her makeup people are doing their thing to prepare her for her next appointment.
  Positive
Of course, Gaga could have either shut off the cameras she was one of the producers and presumably had a little pull in that department or waited until afterwards for the makeup application but that would not have had nearly the same effect.
  Negative
Throughout the film, there are a number of similarinstances where you get the sense that even the most trivial moments are being micromanaged for maximum effect.
  Negative
At one point, we see her having a poolside meeting with her fashion consultants over her plans for a stripped-down look to accompany the publicity push for Joanne a moment that might not have received any notice or even made the final cut except for the fact that she has chosen to appear topless during the entire sequence.
  Negative
That said, there are a couple of moments that are interesting primarily because they dont quite go the way she presumably expected.
  Positive
In one, she plays the title track of her album, a tribute to the late aunt that it was named after, for her grandmother.
  Negative
But what is clearly set up to be an extraordinarily cathartic moment instead moves into something more quiet, practical and touching in its own surprising way.
  Negative
In another sequence, she goes into a Wal-Mart, camera crew in tow, to check the placement of her album when she cannot find it, she starts asking around but neither the clerk nor a security guard recognize her at first.
  Negative
If Gaga: Five Foot Two had been about practically anyone else in the current pop star firmament, it might have come across as -odd minutes of overt navel-gazing of no use to anyone who is not already a lifelong fan club member.
  Negative
However, what makes this documentarywork is the inspiring and engaging presence of Gaga herself.
  Neutral
Yes, there is never a moment when she is not acutely aware that she is on camera but at the same time, she still manages to radiate a simple and genuine sense of decency and humanity that makes her eminently relatable.
  Positive
When she interacts with members of her devoted fan base, there is a deep connection between them that cannot be denied nor faked.
  Positive
When she talks about her hopes of bringing people together via her Super Bowl performance, you get the sense that she really means it and is not just spouting PR pablum.
  Negative
When she is recounting the miseries of the pain she has been suffering over the years, you genuinely feel for her and want to somehow bring her the kind of comfort that her music has brought to so many people over the past few years.
  Positive
And when she levels a couple of zingers at Madonna in response to critiques she has leveled about her in the press  well, lets just say that Hell hath no fury like a pop diva scorned.
  Negative
