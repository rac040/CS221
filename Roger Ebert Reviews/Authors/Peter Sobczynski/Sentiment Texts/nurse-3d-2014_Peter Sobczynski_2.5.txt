From the pre-Code glories of  Barbara Stanwyck in the immortal "Night Nurse" to the  Roger Corman drive-in favorites of the 's to any number of late-night Skinemax favorites, the nursing profession has served as a particularly fertile source of inspiration for producers of sleazy exploitation fare.
  Negative
That fine tradition continues with "NurseD," a film so unabashedly sleazy in every conceivable way as well as a few inconceivable ones to boot that it almost feels as if anyone paying to go see it in a theater should be required to do so using only dollar bills.
  Negative
Our anti-heroine is Abby Russell Paz de la Huerta, a sexbomb nurse who spends her days patrolling the halls of All Saints Hospital while struggling mightily to stay within the confines of her outfit, and spends her nights blowing off steam by pursuing and brutally murdering married men who are straying from their wives.
  Negative
If that weren't enough, she also becomes erotically obsessed with new nurse Danni  Katrina Bowden and becomes determined to steer her away from her amiable lump of a boyfriend  Corbin Bleu and into her arms.
  Negative
At first she tries to lure Danni the old fashioned way a night of drinking, dancing and roofies, a bizarre sexual encounter and what can only be described as a bottomless cup of coffee but when that fails to work, stronger measures are then required.
  Very negative
When Abby's chief plan of attack murdering Danni's lecherous and unfaithful stepfather  Martin Donovan also fails to produce the desired effect, she uses her considerable cunning to make it seem as if Danni is the dangerously unhinged type.
  Negative
While Danni is off trying to prove her innocence and uncover the dark secrets of Abby's past, Abby kills time, among other things, by gruesomely bumping off a few other ancillary characters, including an annoyingly cheerful HR administrator  Melanie Scrofano and the lecherous Dr. Morris  Judd Nelson, before the inevitable Grand Guignol-style finale in which the hospital's sharpest instruments which do not appear to include any of the staff are deployed to maximum effect.
  Negative
If you ever wondered what the result might be if the screenplay for a  Brian De Palma thriller somehow landed in the hands of the late, great  Russ Meyer, "Nurse D" is the film for you.
  Positive
Director  Douglas Aarniokoski and co-writer  David Loughery have concocted a film that plays like an explosion in a warehouse of grindhouse film prints.
  Negative
Within the course of a mere  minutes, they jam in gallons of blood, ridiculously ripe performances, tons of beyond-purple dialogue with the tone set early on when Abby narrates Danni's first encounter with a gory fatality with the instant classic "She lost her virginity and the blood flowed" and so many scenes involving showers, locker rooms and fetishy outfits that it sometimes feels as if All Saints may be the first hospital to require a two-drink minimum along with proof of insurance.
  Negative
Stomping through the proceedings like a frequently naked bull in a china shop is Paz de la Huerta.
  Negative
Whether she can act or not is admittedly a matter for debate all of her line readings are as flat as she isn't and she somehow manages to even snarl in a monotone at certain points.
  Negative
As a presence, however, she is clearly a force to be reckoned with throughout so much so, in fact, that presenting the film in D almost seems superfluous since she practically leaps off the screen without the aid of those ridiculous glasses.
  Negative
Is "Nurse D" any good by conventional critical standards?
  Neutral
Of course not it is ridiculously lurid trash from start to finish and anyone trying to argue otherwise is as crazy as its central character.
  Negative
However, while its aim may be low throughout, it at least comes close to consistently hitting its targets.
  Neutral
I don't quite have the nerve to give it a full recommendation but I do have a certain affection for it and I wouldn't want to discourage anyone from seeing it for themselves if they were inclined to do so.
  Positive
