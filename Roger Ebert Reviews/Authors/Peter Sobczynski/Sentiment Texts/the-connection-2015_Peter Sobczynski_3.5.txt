Attempting to make a companion to " The French Connection" is the kind of seemingly foolhardy move that would give even the most audacious of filmmakers pause William Friedkin's  award-winner literally redefined what could be done within the confines of the cop movie genre.
  Negative
This was proven definitively in  when not even returning stars  Gene Hackman and Fernando Rey and talented director  John Frankenheimer could make "The French Connection II" into anything more than a barely-remembered mediocrity.
  Negative
Nevertheless, the new French crime drama The Connection attempts to do just that, and, while the results inevitably pale in comparison to "The French Connection" which could be said about virtually every other film currently in release they do make for an above-average work that offers viewers a new perspective on a familiar story.
  Negative
The film offers a European take on the "French Connection" story by telling the tale of the infamous heroin smuggling ring and a cop charged with bringing it down on their home turf of Marseilles.
  Positive
The cop is Pierre Michel  Jean Dujardin, a steadfast and dedicated magistrate who is all too familiar with the horrors of addiction from his years bearing witness to junkies as a child protective services officer and from his own past struggles with gambling.
  Negative
His main target is Gatean "Tany" Zampa  Gilles Lellouche, the man heading a criminal enterprise that has been sending huge amounts of heroin to America.
  Negative
An increasingly violent game of cat and mouse develops between the two, each one determined to stop the other at all costs.
  Negative
As they go about their respective businesses, we begin to learn more about the two men and what makes them tick.
  Positive
Pierre, for example, is as incorruptible of a cop as one could hope to find, but it soon becomes obvious that his tunnel-vision attitude toward work has wreaked havoc on his personal life by straining his relationship with his wife  Celine Sallette to the breaking point.
  Negative
Tany also has problems on the home front, chiefly in the form of a money pit of a nightclub he has opened to keep his own wife happy.
  Negative
Interestingly, Tany does not come across like a drug kingpin as much as he does just an ordinary businessman whose life is a never-ending parade of shipping schedules, profit margins and labor problems in need of settling his method of dealing with an associate with a cocaine problem is certainly unique.
  Negative
And yet, while they may be similar in certain ways, they are in a situation in which only one can survive and each goes to great lengths to ensure that it is they who succeed.
  Positive
The original "The French Connection" is still revered for its intense and elaborate action set-pieces it still holds a place of high prominence on the list of all-time great car chases and director Cedric Jimenez has wisely chosen not to try to emulate it on those grounds.
  Positive
Instead of a standard thriller with the requisite number of action beats, he takes a more purely procedural approach, more interested in the accumulation of details surrounding the case and the people involved in that regard, it is closer to David Fincher's masterpiece " Zodiac" than anything else.
  Positive
There is a lot of information being conveyed here, but Jimenez and co-writer Audrey Diwan do an effective job of putting it forth in a lucid and straightforward manner.
  Positive
He also does a strong job of evoking the mid-Seventies period without resorting to kitschy clothes or soundtrack choices thanks to a visual style that is clearly evocative of the crime dramas of the era.
  Positive
That said, it does run a little long at  minutes and probably could have survived with one or two fewer montage sequences.
  Negative
The casting of Dujardin, most famous for his Oscar-winning performance as the flailing movie star in " The Artist," may strike some people as a bit odd, and, indeed, his undeniably debonair persona does seem somewhat strange in the early scenes.
  Very negative
As the film progresses and he becomes more and more gripped with nailing Tany at all costs, that slick veneer slips away and his character becomes a sweaty raw nerve that he portrays with undeniable power.
  Positive
As his opposite, Lellouche is equally compelling in the way that he makes his ruthless crime lord into someone that viewers can still relate to on a basic human level despite his ever-expanding list of misdeeds.
  Positive
There is a large cast of supporting players surrounding these two throughout and their contributions go a long way towards helping to establish the period and the tone of the film as a whole.
  Positive
Again, "The Connection" is not going to replace "The French Connection" in the collective moviegoing mind anytime soon.
  Negative
However, fans of that film will find it to be an interesting riff on a familiar story while those who haven't seen it will be able to appreciate it as a solidly made crime drama in its own right.
  Neutral
