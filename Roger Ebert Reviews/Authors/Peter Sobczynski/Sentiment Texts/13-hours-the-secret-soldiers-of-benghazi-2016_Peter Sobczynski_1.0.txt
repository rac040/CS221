With  Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi,  Michael Bay has done for the attack on Benghazi and those who fought and died there what he did for the attack on Pearl Harbor in  Pearl Harbor reduce the seriousness of the event and the sacrifices made into another exercise of the kind of slick, soulless excess that is virtually indistinguishable, both stylistically and dramatically, from the rest of his filmography.
  Negative
Based on the best-selling account by  Mitchell Zuckoff with the participation of five of the survivors of the attack, the film begins as former Navy SEAL Jack Silva  John Krasinski arrives in Benghazi to work as a private consultant on the security detail for a CIA outpost alongside old friend Tyrone Rone Woods  James Badge Dale.
  Negative
The job isnt ideal Benghazi is one of the most dangerous places in the world' he is separated from his wife and young daughters' and all the official CIA people that he is working under, especially outpost chief Bob  David Costabile, are constantly reminding all the security guys that they are the ones doing the important work.
  Positive
It brings in more money than staying at home and working as a real estate agent.
  Neutral
In early September , U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens Matt Letscher arrives and insists on staying at the diplomatic compound during his visit.
  Negative
While inspecting the premises before the arrival of Ambassador Stevens, Silva, Rone and their fellow security consultants realize instantly that the protection it offers is completely inadequate.
  Negative
They're further appalled when they see that a once-secret meeting has been made into a public affair, alerting everyone in the dangerously unstable region to the presence of Stevens.
  Negative
Nevertheless, the CIA guys and the security patrol at the diplomatic compound poo-poo their warnings and insist that they have everything under control.
  Negative
On September , the compound, with Stevens inside, is attacked by a heavily-armed mob that quickly storms the building and even sets it on fire in an attempt to smoke the ambassador out.
  Negative
From their vantage point at the CIA outpost a mile or so away, Silva, Rone and four other security men on hand Kris Tanto Paronto  Pablo Schreiber, Dave Boon Benton  David Denman, John Tig Tiegan  Dominic Fumusa and Mark Oz Geist  Max Martini can see what is going down and are prepared to rush over and assist, but the main CIA guy gives them a direct order to stand down.
  Very negative
He continues to repeat that order until the six of them decide to defy it and head out to the compound without authorization.
  Negative
Although they fend off waves of attackers and manage to pull a couple of people out, they are unable to find Stevens in the burning building before returning to their base.
  Negative
It is then that the CIA base becomes the new focus of attack and the guys, along with a handful of others, are forced to single-handedly defend the compound and those inside while calls for air support are ignored and a potential rescue force is stuck on the tarmac in Tripoli mired in red tape.
  Very negative
In the hands of the right filmmaker, a film about Benghazi might have yielded something like Ridley Scott's  Black Hawk Down, another chronicle of a mission in an unstable land that went horribly wrong.
  Negative
Scotts film chronicled the horrors of what happened, the heroism of those that fought and the combination of mistakes, misjudgments and plain bad luck that occurred along the way.
  Negative
Alas, Michael Bay has never been known as a director with any sense of nuance, and instead recounts the story in the broadest manner imaginable.
  Negative
The screenplay by Chuck Hogan is about as simplistic and simple-minded as can be our six heroes are near-gods who can do no wrong while the government operatives on display are cartoonishly dumb, obnoxious and blinkered in their thinking.
  Negative
When he wants viewers to recognize what drives our heroes to put themselves in harms way, he not only has one of them read aloud from Joseph Campbells The Power of Myth but repeats that moment as a flashback towards the end which is also pretty much the extent of the character development as well.
  Negative
Frankly, the best writing in the film is featured in a clip from  Tropic Thunder that is shown and considering what that movie is about a group of actors going off to film a war story that proves to be not quite as accurate as advertised its inclusion comes across as either the sickest joke imaginable or a weird bit of meta-commentary that somehow got slipped into the mix.
  Negative
As for Bay, he treats the material in much the same manner for everything else like a hyper-violent video game featuring lots of dazzle and precious little else.
  Negative
Thinking back to Black Hawk Down, you will recall how brilliantly Scott evoked the confusion of what happened while still laying everything out in a manner and allowing viewers to follow along and find order in the chaos.
  Negative
Hours evokes plenty of confusion, but it is less the fog of war and more the fog of a filmmaker who seems incapable of following the basic rules of film grammar when needed.
  Negative
One could argue that Bay is trying for a you are there approach that plunges viewers into the mayhem and keeps them as much in the dark as the character were but he just doesnt have the skills to pull it off.
  Negative
Utilizing his familiar arsenal of rapid edits, slow-motion and showy special effects including a bit following a mortar as it descends from the skies to hit its target that appears to be Bays homage to a similar shot in his own Pearl Harbor, he does everything he can to get an immediate reaction including a bit in which the American flag is machine-gunned in slow-motion that feels like the longest sustained shot in the film but neglects to give viewers anything else to grasp onto that could give them any understanding of what happened.
  Negative
As bad as the action is, the allegedly character-driven bits are even worse a scene in which Silva gets some news from his wife and kids over a video chat while the family is at a McDonalds drive-thru is so badly handled in every possible way that it makes the scene in Bays  Armageddon with  Ben Affleck,  Liv Tyler and some animal crackers seem positively subtle by comparison.
  Very negative
Simply put,  Hours is a pretty dreadful movie and while watching it, I sat there trying to figure out what kind of audience might actually go for it.
  Very negative
Those of the liberal persuasion will write it off because it presents elements that have been highly disputed or flat-out denied such as the stand-down orders as unquestioned fact.
  Negative
Conservatives may be upset that it doesnt go far enough in tying Hillary Clinton to the events depicted unless I missed it, she is never once mentioned specifically.
  Negative
As an action movie and as a historical document, it is a bombastic and wholly inauthentic mess that displays precious little interest in the men whose actions and sacrifices it purports to honor.
  Negative
There is a good and interesting movie out there to be made about the tragic events at Benghazi and the political aftermath but  Hours is definitely not it.
  Positive
