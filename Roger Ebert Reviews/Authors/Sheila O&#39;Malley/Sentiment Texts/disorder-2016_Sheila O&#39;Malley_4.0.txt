  Negative
He has a hard time distinguishing legitimate threats because everything seems threatening.
  Negative
His head is filled with buzzing and ringing from his damaged ear, and he often clamps his hands over his head, massaging it, trying to make the buzzing go away, trying to tamp down the internal chaos.
  Very negative
Played by  Matthias Schoenaerts, Vincent is a tormented and inarticulate man, and the riveting center of Alice Winocour's sexy, relentless thriller "Disorder."
  Positive
While he waits to be sent back to war, he and his army pals get jobs in a security detail, their first gig working a party at a mansion owned by a Lebanese businessman named Imad Whalid  Percy Kemp.
  Negative
Whalid lives there with his wife Jessie  Diane Kruger and small son Ali  Zad Errougui-Demonsant.
  Neutral
Television screens proliferate in every space, showing news anchors speculating about a growing political scandal involving international arms-dealing and French politicians that could topple governments and corporations.
  Negative
Vincent's just a soldier, albeit a highly trained one.
  Neutral
He was sent to fight a war by those in power, the people at this very party.
  Negative
His health and his mind were wrecked for it, while those at home got to stay safe and oblivious.
  Negative
He has no say in how his country has used him, and then tossed him out.
  Negative
Vincent's sixth sense tells him that something is very wrong at that party, but he doesn't know what.
  Negative
Hand-picked by Whalid to guard Jessie and Ali while Whalid goes out of the country on business, Vincent settles into a new routine, strolling the grounds, checking locks, driving the wife and kid for an outing to the beach.
  Negative
Diane Kruger is lovely and fragile here, with spurts of sharpness, and an occasional imperious attitude towards Vincent.
  Neutral
Vincent is almost shy with her, feeling the vast class differences between them.
  Negative
He has no problem bonding with the family dog, however a nice touch, calling to mind Arthur Miller's comment to  Peter Bogdanovich on why his late wife  Marilyn Monroe got along so well with children and animals: "They didn't sneer at her."
  Positive
From the first moment he saw Jessie, crying in a bedroom during the party, Vincent is intensely drawn to her.
  Negative
As shattered as he is, he is a natural protector.
  Positive
Schoenaerts often plays such roles, most memorably in " Bullhead" and "Rust and Bone."
  Negative
He's wonderful playing men bound up in muscles, unable to let loose their equally powerful tenderness.
  Positive
Schoenaerts' vulnerability as an actor leads him towards a rough and honest kind of truth.
  Positive
As the film plunges into a home-invasion thriller, with mysterious cars parked at the end of the driveway and shadowy figures stalking the house, some viewers may feel they have seen it all before.
  Negative
But Winocour has such a unique approach to the familiar material that the clichs this is, after all, a genre film are irrelevant.
  Positive
The entire story is told solely from Vincent's often-distorted point of view.
  Negative
Because of his considerable physical and emotional challenges, many of the sequences have a hallucinatory quality, starting with the party, where Vincent wanders through the crowd in slo-mo the camera trailing along behind him, as it does throughout, the dance music's bass line throbbing, a sound Vincent feels, rather than hears.
  Positive
Vincent's brain, already flooded with excess adrenaline, cannot absorb what comes at him' he isn't sure if what he perceives is real or a phantom manifestation of war trauma.
  Negative
His confusion bleeds out into the audience.
  Neutral
We question his reliability as a narrator.
  Negative
It's extremely effective.
  Positive
In a stunning sequence on the beach with Jessie and Ali, Vincent senses a threat, like an animal senses a predator approaching, even though it's as yet unseen.
  Positive
On high alert, he scans the benign landscape for what he knows is out there.

  Negative
Everything is distorted and disorienting.
  Negative
Voices are fuzzed-out.
  Neutral
Lawn sprinklers sound like Niagara Falls.
  Negative
A vacuum erupts into a roar.
  Neutral
Brian De Palma's " Blow Out" instantly comes to mind, as well as Francis Ford Coppola's " The Conversation," stories with a similar obsession with sound as well as atmospheres of phantasmagorical political paranoia.
  Positive
There is wonderful, complex scene-work done by the actors, especially in one scene where Vincent's security buddy comes to the house, and flirts so easily with Jessie that Vincent looks on, uneasy and jealous.
  Positive
He's left out.
  Negative
Nothing is easy for Vincent.
  Positive
There's another scene, late in the game, where Jessie, who has by now spent more time with Vincent than her own husband, tells Vincent about how she could see him moving to Canada and living in the wild, that that was his true milieu.
  Negative
Vincent actually laughs, but Schoenaerts adds shyness, and surprise that anyone especially her gives him a second thought, sees a possible alternative for him, sees him at all.
  Positive
It's moments like that when Winocour, an extremely gifted director who also co-wrote last year's stunning " Mustang," another story about people trapped in a house, really shows her cards, what interests her.
  Positive
It's him.
  Neutral
Schoenaerts is a major actor.
  Neutral
He is such a strong physical presence that his best roles have utilized it explicitly, making his body and his size an integral part of the character.
  Very positive
What makes him a great actor is that his sensitivity and subtle inventiveness in terms of how psychological reality is revealed through behavior, is equal to the size of his body.
  Positive
His is not just a natural, instinctive gift.

It's a smart actor at work, understanding that the most important thing is what's going on in his head.

"Disorder" is tense and scary, beautiful to look at and even more gorgeous to hear.

In the end, it is also extremely moving.
  Positive
That's the most thrilling part of all.
