"Can you tell I'm dead inside just by looking at me?"
  Neutral
deadpans Shirin, a bisexual Iranian-American Brooklynite who just broke up with her girlfriend Maxine.
  Negative
The deadpan tone is dominant throughout "Appropriate Behavior," a really promising debut from writerdirector and star  Desiree Akhavan.
  Positive
Movies about -somethings wandering through Brooklyn, going to parties, having relationships, and then talking about it over lattes have become so cliched that a new "way in" to it doesn't even seem possible.
  Negative
But "Appropriate Behavior," even with its reliance on familiar types and tropes, feels like a unique vision of life seen through unique eyes.
  Negative
And so although we have all seen movies about deadpan Brooklyn hipsters, we haven't quite seen thisyet.
  Negative
Akhavan uses the clichd environment and characters aimless hopeful artists, cool parties, flat-affect wit in order to highlight some of the voices and energies that have typically been left out of such stories up until now.
  Positive
There's something fresh going on here, and it marks Akhavan as a filmmaker and actress to watch.
  Positive
Shirin is the child of immigrants from Iran.
  Neutral
She is not out to her parents, a major bone of contention in her relationship with Maxine  Rebecca Henderson, although Shirin berates Maxine for not getting it: "I come from Iran, Maxine.
  Neutral
You know, where they stone gay people?"
  Neutral
Shirin's parents  Anh Duong and Hooman Majd are highly accomplished individuals, as is her judgmental brother Ali  Arian Moayed, a urologist engaged to be married to a plastic surgeon.
  Negative
Shirin's parents still ask their daughter, hopefully, if she's met any nice boys.
  Negative
They assume that Shirin and Maxine are just friends and roommates who happen to have only one bed in their apartment.
  Negative
Shirin loves her family, although her parents' loving concern of her often feels like pressure.
  Positive
She senses that she's a disappointment to them.
  Negative
She's a disappointment to herself.
  Very negative
She rarely leaves her borough.
  Positive
She has a Masters in Journalism but doesn't use it' instead, she teaches a filmmaking class to rowdy -year-olds at a competitive Park Slope school and lives behind a curtain in a sprawling Bushwick apartmentartist-space with two slightly frightening roommates.
  Negative
The relationship with Maxine told through flashbacks was all-consuming, and Shirin has sentimentalized it in memory, telling a friend, "We were an It Couple."
  Negative
Maxine is self-righteous and judgmental, cloaked in identity politics.
  Negative
On their first meeting, Shirin, drunk, wearing a tiara at a New Year's Eve party, looks at Maxine's rather severe outfit and says, "I love dykes."
  Negative
Maxine tells her how offensive that word is.
  Negative
Shirin is baffled.
  Negative
She meant it as a compliment.
  Positive
Ultimately, what we end up seeing is that Shirin doesn't fit in anywhere.
  Negative
She is bisexual, which means she's somewhat an object of suspicion to more strict lesbians.
  Positive
"This is just a phase for you," sneers Maxine at one point.
  Negative
With her parents, she puts on the face of the obedient Persian daughter, leaving out the vast majority of who she is in order to get along.
  Negative
At a raucous Persian Nowruz party, she gossips and commiserates with the Persian girls she grew up with, but feels completely cut off from engagement.
  Negative
She is unable to engage fully with any one group.
  Negative
The appeal of the relationship with Maxine is never really evident in the film, and that is one of the flaws of the deadpan approach.
  Negative
When real feeling comes up, the deadpan tone leaves you nowhere to go.
  Negative
You have deadpanned yourself into a corner.
  Neutral
In other films about lost love, like " Annie Hall," a clear influence on "Appropriate Behavior," everything in the past is suffused with magic and the longing of retrospect.
  Positive
But Shirin and Maxine seem like a mis-match from the beginning, and Shirin deadpanning about how she is "dead inside" adds to the overall disconnection from warmth and feeling.
  Negative
Perhaps, on some level, "Appropriate Behavior" is all about that.
  Neutral
For Shirin, what is "appropriate behavior" depends on her context.
  Neutral
Her parents expect certain things of her.
  Positive
They love her, but she is terrified of what will happen when they find out she likes women.
  Negative
Maxine wants her to be more appropriately gay, more in line with the lesbian scene, she is annoyed when Shirin befriends a drag queen at a Pride Week party.
  Negative
Maxine thinks Shirin is a tourist in the gay world.
  Neutral
But Shirin is a tourist everywhere: that's the problem.
  Negative
Her tourist stance makes her awkward.
  Negative
That awkwardness is extremely honest, and Akhavan is wonderful in showing Shirin's various defense mechanisms, with other more politicized gays, with people who treat her Iranian-ness as "exotic" and ask her to weigh in on "that whole situation over there."
  Positive
She's a representative of a mysterious group and is treated accordingly.
  Positive
A prospective boss in a job interview is openly agog when she says that yes, she goes to Tehran every summer to visit family.
  Negative
Tehran to him is like the Emerald City, he's seen documentaries about the "whole underground hip-hop scene" there  is she into that at all?
  Negative
Shirin says patiently that no, her visits to Tehran involve hanging out with her grandmother and watching Disney movies.
  Negative
The guy looks disappointed.
  Negative
He was hoping for stories of oppression and hijabs and courage.
  Positive
Explaining her Iranian-ness to uncomprehending Americans is a part of her everyday life.
  Neutral
And this, this is the element of "Appropriate Behavior" that shows Akhavan's true voice.
  Positive
As a writer, Akhavan has a lot of fun sending up certain Brooklyn types with one or two brutal lines.
  Positive
Shirin meets up with a guy from OK Cupid, and he tells her his art "defies labels," that he wants to use his stand-up comedy "to bring attention to social justice issues."
  Positive
She has an interaction with a lingerie saleswoman who seems to see her job in the context of helping women with their self-esteem issues.
  Positive
The saleswoman says to Shirin, "Just because your breasts are small doesn't mean they're not legitimate.
  Negative
It's okay to be angry."
  Neutral
Shirin was just looking for some underwear, not a therapeutic pep-talk.
  Negative
Akhavan has a loopy lampooning spirit, ultimately, and at one point she clocks the deadpan tone of her own film when Shirin lambasts one of her dates, "What's up with your passive disinterest in everything?
  Negative
What happened at Wesleyan that did this to you?"
  Neutral
Akhavan gets that the deadpan tone is limiting, that it has limited Shirin, not only in her engagement with her own life, but with her family, her friends, her girlfriends and boyfriends, her Iranian-ness, her American-ness.
  Negative
She's got to integrate, she's got to find a way to live a whole life, uncompartmentalized and free.
  Positive
The children of immigrants have a very specific outlook on what it feels like to have a foot in two worlds.
  Negative
As a director, Akhavan steers the ship confidently.
  Negative
It's not flashily filmed, there's nothing to distract from the story itself.
  Negative
There's a lot to get across here, a lot of information, but the real strength of "Appropriate Behavior" is that you can sense, in every scene, that Akhavan really has something to  say .
  Positive
This story comes from her, and it could only come from her.
  Neutral
