Everything has a price in  Juan Carlos Maneglia and Tana Schmbori's " Boxes".
  Negative
You want something?
  Neutral
You better have something to trade, be it information, money hard to come by, or one of those nifty new cell phones with a video camera. "
  Neutral
Boxes" takes place in a -hour period within the sprawling Byzantine maze of a Paraguayan market.
  Neutral
Everyone knows everyone.
  Positive
It is .
  Neutral
Cell phones are still a novelty, let alone ones that can take pictures and videos.
  Neutral
You could do anything if you had one.
  Neutral
They are currency.
  Neutral
Currency, and what it means in different situations, is the underlying theme of " Boxes", its urgent motor.
  Negative
The brutality of capitalism is not critiqued by any of the characters because they are too concerned with survival to worry themselves over concepts, but the implications are clear.
  Negative
You can't get anything in this world, drugs for your sick child, a girlfriend, a cell phone, without currency.
  Negative
Victor  Celso Franco is a kid who works as a delivery boy in the market.
  Positive
He has a rickety wheelbarrow and he hustles customers to let him carry their goods.
  Positive
Victor is young and wily.
  Neutral
He's also captivated by anything that has a  screen: security cameras, used televisions, his friend Liz's cell phone  with a video.
  Negative
He wants one.
  Positive
He has no money.
  Negative
So when he is suddenly offered a weird gig by a sleazy butcher to transport seven boxes with contents unknown away from the butcher's shop surrounded by cops, he jumps at the chance.
  Negative
Unbeknownst to Victor, another guy named Nelson  Vctor Sosa was supposed to get that delivery job, only he was late for the pick-up.
  Negative
Nelson, a desperate man with a sick son, sets out to find Victor and steal the seven boxes so he can collect the payment which he sees as rightfully his.
  Negative
There's nothing like a strong set-up, and the set-up in " Boxes" is powerful, simple and dramatic.
  Positive
What is in the boxes?
  Neutral
Why are they so important?
  Negative
Cops prowl through the market, but they are as corrupt and on-the-make as everyone else.
  Negative
Everyone can be bribed.
  Negative
Cell phones are passed around, from pocket to pocket, and, in one funny scene, a cell phone is stolen, and Victor, thinking he's calling the butcher, gets the thief instead.
  Very negative
"Can I speak to Mr. Dario?"
  Neutral
"This is my phone now.
  Neutral
I'm the thief who stole his phone."
  Neutral
"Oh, okay.
  Positive
Bye."
  Neutral
Victor has a sister Nelly Davalos, who works in the kitchen of a Korean restaurant, and a friend named Liz Lali Gonzalez, who tags along with him, but other than that his whole world is his wheelbarrow and the market, as well as the pull of any television screen in his vicinity.
  Negative
No matter how tense the moment is, Victor stops in his tracks to stare at the images, commercials, American movies dubbed in Spanish, and even himself on security-camera footage.
  Negative
What is it he sees?
  Neutral
Escape?
  Neutral
Wealth?
  Neutral
Fame?
  Negative
Whatever it is, it represents the irresistible allure of a life where currency is available, up for grabs, where there's more than enough money to go around.
  Positive
Victor has no resentment about his poverty.
  Negative
He is too busy trying to survive being chased by Nelson and by the cops.
  Negative
But he is pulled up and out of himself, through the technology proliferating around him in endless screens.
  Negative
As it becomes clear to him that the seven boxes are bad news, and that he is in serious trouble, he hides the boxes.
  Negative
That doesn't work out well.
  Negative
Liz steals the boxes, to help him out, and then he steals them back.
  Positive
Meanwhile, Nelson has gathered together a gang of desperate people willing to help track down Victor in order to get a piece of Nelson's payment.
  Negative
The chase takes them through the market, its random dance clubs, and lunch counters, its back alleys, and warehouse spaces.
  Negative
Some of these scenes, crowded, busy, frenetic, are reminiscent of some of Jafar Panahi's films, with their use of actors who don't seem like actors at all racing through real-life urban settings.
  Negative
Victor is on the run, but he has nowhere to go.
  Negative
He never leaves the market.
  Negative
But as the competing circles close in on him, as the seven terrible boxes loom in portent, he and his friend Liz huddle against an iron gate, hiding, and suddenly, impulsively, he leans in and kisses her.
  Negative
He obviously had wanted to kiss her for a while.
  Neutral
Their relationship is the teasing annoyed banter that screams romantic tension.
  Negative
But perhaps he saw a movie star kiss a girl like that once, and perhaps it gave him courage, it showed him how.  "
  Neutral
Boxes" is both a tense and frightening crime film as well as a sometimes-dreamy evocation of life in the sprawling underclass, its hallucinatory aspects, its chaos and violence, its fantasies.
  Negative
