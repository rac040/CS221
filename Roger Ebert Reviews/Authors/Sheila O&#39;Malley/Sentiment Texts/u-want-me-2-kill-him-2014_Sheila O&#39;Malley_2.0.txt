  Positive
Based on a true story, which dominated British tabloids in , resulting in a groundbreaking legal case and inspiring an opera, "U Want Me  Kill Him?"
  Neutral
takes us through how Mark arrived at that particular creepy answer.
  Neutral
The facts of the case almost beggar belief, and were told, in full,  in a  Vanity Fair article by Judy Bachrach.
  Negative
The film assumes we do not know the story.
  Negative
Director  Andrew Douglas, who helmed the "Amityville Horror" remake in , and screenwriter  Mike Walden, have chosen to structure the film like a typical thriller police procedural, with a jumbled chronology and a third-act reveal when the truth comes out.
  Negative
It's effective, in its way, and the acting is excellent, across the board.
  Very positive
But "U Want Me  Kill Him" side-steps the real fascination with the story, its real guts, which is: Why?
  Positive
Criminal duos are endlessly interesting due to the psychological questions they bring up: Would either of the individuals have acted alone?
  Negative
Would Macbeth have done what he did if he hadn't had his wife whispering in his ear to "man up"?
  Neutral
Would Leopold and Loeb have ever committed that crime by themselves?
  Neutral
What is in the alchemy of the respective pairings that created this murderous third?
  Neutral
Cinema loves its deadly duos, from " Bonnie and Clyde," to " Heavenly Creatures," to "Gun Crazy," to "Don't Deliver Us From Evil", the list goes on forever.
  Negative
The pairing in "U Want Me  Kill Him?"
  Neutral
is different in many important ways, mainly because Mark is unaware that he is being played.
  Positive
He was a dupe, a fool of a much more cunning individual.
  Negative
What happened to Mark that made him open to the whispered sinister suggestion, what was in him or not in him that made him blindly accept everything at face value?
  Neutral
Mark lives with his parents in Manchester.
  Neutral
He goes to school, he's popular, and he has big vague dreams of doing something that nobody has done before "like create the Internet."
  Negative
His parents are nicely drawn individuals, the father who lifts weights and tells his son to be "his own Master", while the mother compulsively buys lottery tickets every week.
  Positive
Meanwhile, Mark has a whole world they do not know about.
  Negative
Every night he sexy-chats online with a girl he has never met, a pretty blonde named Rachel  Jaime Winstone.
  Negative
Not only is Rachel great at dirty talk, she is also and this seems to be the most attractive part to Mark a damsel in distress.
  Positive
She is afraid of her violent boyfriend Kevin Mingus Johnston.
  Neutral
She has secrets.
  Positive
She also happens to have a little brother who goes to school with Mark, a geeky weird kid named John  Toby Regbo.
  Positive
John gets bullied.
  Neutral
Rachel pleads with Mark to look out for him.
  Neutral
Mark and John, somewhat improbably, become friends, after Mark beats up some of the bullies.
  Positive
The two hang out, John opens up to Mark about all of his problems, how worried he is about his sister Rachel, how much he hates how he is treated at school.
  Negative
Through John, Mark learns more about his mysterious night-time Internet friend, Rachel.
  Negative
Her boyfriend is in the witness protection program, she has cut ties with the family, everyone is afraid she is in danger.
  Positive

  Neutral

  Negative
Mark is devastated.
  Neutral
He starts lifting weights.
  Positive
He fools around with his dad's gleaming sword, slicing through the air in his living room, lost in a fantasy of revenge.
  Negative
Things take a turn into the definitely bizarre when an MI agent contacts Mark, via IM, and warns him off Kevin, saying that MI is tracking Kevin for their own byzantine conspiracy-theory reasons having to do with counter-terrorism.
  Negative
Mark never once questions the credibility of those he encounters online, and never once asks why on earth an MI agent would not only reach out to him personally, but enlist his help in another one of their operations.
  Negative
Mark's credulity is certainly believable, and one can sense that this is a boy who doesn't know what he wants to do in life, his grades are not all that good, and he wants to make a big impression on people.
  Positive
He's a perfect "mark", in other words.
  Very positive
The puzzle-piece timeline, starting with the crime and the ensuing investigation led by a police inspector, played by "Downton Abbey"'s  Joanne Froggatt mixed with flashbacks to how it all began, works, but the real horror, of why this might have happened, is ultimately lost in the cliched genre-trappings of the story's structure.
  Very negative
Instead what we are given is a cautionary tale about being wary of the folks you meet on the Internet, which has been done before and done better.
  Negative
The reason this story ignited debates that persist to this day is the "why" of it.
  Negative
How was Mark so manipulated?
  Neutral
Douglas has used an almost entirely blue palate, drenching the film too much at times in cold paranoia and isolation.
  Negative
There are some great visuals, John and Mark approaching Kevin's towering tenement building, dwarfed by its sheer stone walls, or the two boys strolling on a rock jetty by the seaside, almost entirely surrounded by water.
  Positive
Mark looks out at the boats in the sea, and they seem misty and glamorous and far far away.
  Positive
These are tantalizing glimpses, hinting at the deeper psychological abysses at play here, but they are left unexplored.
  Negative
By holding back on the big "reveal", by prioritizing the desire to "sting" the audience at the end, "U Want Me  Kill Him" stays frustratingly on the surface.
  Positive
