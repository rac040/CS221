Based on the best-selling novel by Zane, "Addicted," directed by Bille  Woodruff, offers steamy sex, domestic melodrama, -step piety and  deep shame, sometimes all in the same scene.
  Negative
"Addicted" is the story of a  woman who has it all: happy marriage, two kids and an exciting career, and  yet throws it all away because of her addiction to sex.
  Positive
The sex she has  outside her marriage is thrilling and forbidden, but she has plenty of  sex with her husband too.
  Positive
"Addicted" is supposed to be erotica, so perhaps thinking  about it too much is unfair, but the film is so uneven it's both hot  and preachy, as well as way too long, that thinking becomes inevitable.
  Negative
The situation is not helped by a bloated, confused script that doesn't  seem to know what it wants to be.
  Negative
Zoe has a lot of hot sex.
  Neutral
She is  punished for it.
  Positive
She realizes she is "sick."
  Neutral
Cue strings.
  Neutral
The film opens with Zoe  Sharon Leal getting out of her car wearing a  fitted, houndstooth coat and giant sunglasses, walking in slo-mo towards a  building as men turn to gaze at her appreciatively.
  Negative
She smiles back.
  Positive
She also fingers a mysterious scar on her wrist.
  Positive
She is going to meet  with a psychiatrist for the first time.
  Positive
The psychiatrist  Tasha Smith,  good in a thankless role asks Zoe to tell her story.
  Positive
Zoe voiceovers  that her life is perfect, and we are treated to a montage of playing  charades with her family, and hot naked sex with her husband.
  Positive
"He's my  soulmate," says Zoe, as we watch the two of them writhe about in bed, an  unintentionally comedic moment.
  Negative
The hot-husband-sex is followed by Zoe  sneaking down to watch porn on her laptop and masturbate.
  Negative
Masturbating,  in the world of "Addicted," is a sign that something is deeply wrong in  the marriage.
  Negative
Things aren't so perfect after all.
  Negative
Zoe is an artists' rep who has her own company, and she is obsessed with  signing a mysterious artist named Quinton Canosa  William Levy.
  Negative
When  asked why she loves his work, this woman who supposedly has a background  in art, says: "His stuff just grabs me in the gut, you know?"
  Negative
The two  meet cute at a gallery, and he smolders at her meaningfully,  bedroom-eyeing her instantly, and she blushes and acts flustered and yet  available.
  Positive
Before you know it, they are having sex in his fabulous  private studio, as well as in an empty warehouse where he shows her a  mural he has been working on for years "I've never shown this to  anyone," he tells her with tears of vulnerability in his eyes.
  Negative
Zoe  starts sneaking around on her husband, and things with Quinton quickly  become too complicated for her to handle.
  Negative
Not only is he always in some  state of nudity, tempting her with his rock-hard abs, he is also tender  and damaged.
  Negative
The screenplay, by  Ernie Barbarash and Christine Welsh, is both totally  on-the-nose and totally a mess.
  Very negative
Zoe races into the arms of her various  lovers, neglecting her husband  Boris Kodjoe and kids, giving herself  over to the newness of her conquests, and it's all presented in as  sexualized and erotic a way as possible.
  Negative
The sex is graphic, but in a "Red Shoe Diaries" kind of way.
  Positive
But "Addicted" also  wants to shame and contain Zoe through the introduction of -step  language and a back story that "explains" her behavior.
  Negative
It all feels  stiff and imposed, as though suddenly "Addicted" remembered it wanted to  be a Lifetime Movie of the Week that has a lesson  for us all, instead of erotica that knows it wants to turn you on and  has no shame about that.
  Negative
The performers are pretty game considering the ridiculous  material.
  Negative
The characters aren't recognizable human beings, they are  overwrought emotional states walking through immaculate settings wearing  fabulous clothing ready to be torn off at a moment's notice.
  Negative
Emayatzy  Corinealdi plays Zoe's assistant, a straight-talking go-getter,  frustrated with her distracted boss, and she brings a practical energy  to the hothouse mood of the film that is welcome and often funny.
  Positive
She  feels like a real person.
  Positive
Woodruff steers the ship smoothly, for the most part.
  Negative
The problem lies  in the conflicted attitudes the film has towards its own subject  material.
  Negative
's " When a Man Loves a Woman," a clear influence on  "Addicted," showed a marriage nearly done in by alcoholism, and was a  serious look at addiction, acknowledging the tough truth that not only  the "sick" one needed to change.
  Negative
The entire dance step of the  relationship had to shift if the marriage was going to last.
  Neutral
"Addicted"  is unwilling to confront that complexity.
  Positive
The film lingers so lovingly  over Zoe's many sexual exploits that one almost feels disappointed when  it becomes clear that the film is about to turn into a lecture.
  Negative
Erotica  is best when it doesn't take itself too seriously.
  Positive
