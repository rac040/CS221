"Captain Fantastic," written and directed by "Silicon Valley"'s  Matt Ross, presents a family who have retreated from the world into the wilderness of the Pacific Northwest.
  Negative
They are off the grid.
  Neutral
They hunt for food.
  Neutral
They are self-reliant.
  Neutral
It's "Swiss Family Robinson," or that s series of films about "The Wilderness Family."
  Neutral
Fresh air.
  Positive
No consumerism.
  Neutral
No materialism.
  Neutral
Okay, sounds fine, if a little unsustainable.
  Positive
Such utopias need a strong leader, and father Ben  Viggo Mortensen is that.
  Positive
He treats his five kids as though they are military recruits as well as PhD candidates.
  Negative
Because they are children, and because they are cut off from other influences, they parrot back to him his words, they share his worldview without question.
  Positive
It's Family as Cult.
  Neutral
All of this is extremely intriguing, calling to mind films like " The Mosquito Coast," or " Running on Empty," which had similar cloistered family atmospheres, and charismatic controlling albeit well-meaning fathers.
  Very positive
But "Captain Fantastic" treats the situation and Ben so uncritically and so sympathetically that there is a total disconnect between what is actually onscreen and what Ross thinks is onscreen.
  Negative
When the film opens, the mother of this little clan Trin Miller's Leslie has been hospitalized for bipolar disorder, leaving Dad as "captain" of the ship.
  Negative
He puts the kids through fight training, boot camp drills and ushers his oldest son Bodevan  George MacKay into manhood through the ritual of stalking and killing a deer solo.
  Negative
At night they sit around a campfire, the kids reading books like  Guns, Germs and Steel ,  Middlemarch and Dostoevsky.
  Negative
They argue about capitalism and exploited classes, sounding like little robots, Bodevan informing his dad at one point, "I'm not a Trotsky-ist anymore.
  Negative
I'm a Maoist."
  Neutral
This is a family where "Trotsky-ist" is descriptive and "Trotsky-ite" is an insult.
  Negative
It's like it's  in the Soviet Union.
  Neutral
The kids miss their mother and want to know when she's coming back.
  Negative
When Ben gets word that Leslie has killed herself, he informs the kids in blunt plain language.
  Neutral
Leslie's parents blame Ben for everything and forbid him from coming to the funeral.
  Neutral
Ben, who has set up his whole life so that he never has to answer to anyone, piles the kids into their gigantic school bus, and heads off to crash the funeral and make sure Leslie gets the Buddhist cremation ceremony she always wanted.
  Negative
It's a long road trip.
  Neutral
They pull off occasionally, once to steal supplies from a grocery store they've run such drills before, and once for an annual family ritual: the celebration of  Noam Chomsky Day.
  Negative
What will happen one day if one of the kids decides Noam Chomsky is full of it?
  Neutral
Will that even be allowed?
  Neutral
The irony here, and it is a terrible one, is that Ben is raising his kids to question the status quo, to not swallow any information wholesale, and yet he creates an environment where questioning his authorityis impossible.
  Negative
The family stops and stays the night with family Kathryn Hahn's Harper, Steve Zahn's Dave and their two kids, and the culture clash is extreme.
  Positive
Ben's kids don't know anything about pop culture.
  Neutral
To win the argument that his kids have been educated just fine without going to school, Ben forces his six-year-old to give an impromptu treatise on the Bill of Rights, the purpose of which is to shame the public-school cousins who have no idea about anything.
  Negative
The child rattling off facts about the Bill of Rights is supposed to be adorable and comedic as well as a "high five" moment for the family.
  Positive
I guess.
  Neutral
It looked more like Ben was being a sanctimonious bully towards those who welcomed him into their home.
  Negative
"Captain Fantastic" does acknowledge some of the issues in a character like Ben: Bodevan has to apply to college behind his dad's back, and Rellian  Nicholas Hamilton rebels openly against his father's control.
  Negative
Rellian makes a choice at one point that feels like a victory and then he backtracks, apologizing to his father for disobedience.
  Negative
To his apology, Ben does not say, "I'm sorry too."
  Negative
He says, "I love you."
  Positive
It's supposed to be touching.
  Neutral
It's not.
  Negative
Rellian is ten years old.
  Neutral
He has nothing to apologize for.
  Negative
That's the issue with "Captain Fantastic" in a nutshell.
  Negative
"Captain Fantastic" is so soft on Ben that when  Frank Langella shows up as Leslie's father, and expresses outrage at the way Ben raises the children, he sounds like the voice of reason.
  Negative
And yet the film treats Langella as though he's the villain, a self-satisfied Fat Cat, emblematic of everything Ben and his wife and their drone-children hate.
  Negative
"Look at the unethical use of space!"
  Neutral
chirps one of Ben's daughters, looking at their grandfather's backyard.
  Neutral
The kids Hamilton, MacKay,  Charlie Shotwell,  Shree Crooks,  Samantha Isler,  Annalise Basso are all excellent, and create a believable family unit.
  Very positive
Mortensen gives Ben's authoritarian bent shadings of softness, openness, especially when he encourages his kids to think their thoughts through forcing his daughter to go deeper in her literary analysis of  Lolita  is a nice little scene.
  Positive
Mortensen is a tremendously powerful actor, and he can do more in a closeup than most actors can with their whole bodies.
  Positive
It's the attitude of the film that's the problem.
  Negative
Jean-Jacques Rousseau didn't invent the idea of getting back to nature as the ultimate Good.
  Negative
It's been with human beings since Adam and Eve frolicked in the garden.
  Neutral
The thinking goes: If human beings could "get back to nature," then maybe all the problems in the world could be eradicated.
  Negative
But there's an error in that kind of thinking.
  Negative
Citizens of poverty-struck countries already live in a "natural" state, with no running water, subsistence agriculture, no modern medicine.
  Negative
They could probably tell the hippies a thing or two about how "nature" in its raw state is no great shakes, and a warm bed and a hot bath are nothing to sneeze at.
  Negative
But the mindset persists and it crosses ideological lines.
  Positive
There are the Amish and the Mennonites.
  Neutral
There are the "survivalists," holed up in compounds with their arsenals and conspiracy theories.
  Negative
There are the radical off-shoots of Christianity favoring homeschooling, and prioritizing being "in but not of" the world.
  Negative
Jonestown is the most dangerous example of what a retreat from the world can result in, but there are others with equally devastating consequences.
  Negative
Society isn't the problem.
  Neutral
Man is the problem.
  Neutral
A utopia can only work if it's made up of one person.
  Neutral
The second another person shows up, you're going to have problems.
  Negative
If Ben were a "Jesus Camp" type, steeped in a political brand of Christianity, preparing his kids for apocalyptic Rapture, would his behavior be presented as adorably eccentric as it is here?
  Negative
Would a film present a survivalist-dad holed up with his kids and his weaponry as uncritically?
  Neutral
It's the same mindset, just different ideologies.
  Negative
Just because Ben is a lefty doesn't mean he's not a jerk.
  Negative
"Captain Fantastic" could have used a lot more skepticism.
  Negative
