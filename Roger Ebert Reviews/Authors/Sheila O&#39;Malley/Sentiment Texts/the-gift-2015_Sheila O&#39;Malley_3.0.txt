In " The Gift," written and directed by actor  Joel Edgerton, Simon  Jason Bateman and his wife  Rebecca Hall have an awkward reunion dinner with a guy Simon knew from high school, a guy named Gordon nicknamed "Gordo", played by Edgerton.
  Negative
After it's over, Simon turns to his wife and says, "Did he seem odd to you?"
  Negative
Well, yes.
  Neutral
He did.
  Positive
And he gets odder.
  Positive
The odd-ness is hard to define.
  Negative
Is it the flat look in his eyes?
  Negative
Is it the mystery around why he keeps showing up, why he leaves wrapped gifts at the door, why he even wants to strike up a friendship at all, when Simon seems to barely remember the guy?
  Negative
What's Gordo up to?
  Neutral
What does he want?
  Neutral
One of the intense and disturbing pleasures of "The Gift," why the film creates such a sense of unease, is that the answers to those questions are just the tip of the iceberg.
  Negative
Edgerton's script is extremely effective: he is interested in what happens between a supposedly happy couple when a third party introduces doubt, insecurity, second-thoughts, into the marriage.
  Positive
It's like an invisible poison released into the atmosphere, working on everyone in unpredictable and terrifying ways.
  Negative
"The Gift" is similar to " Cape Fear," or " Fatal Attraction," or, in another way, " The Night of the Hunter" in that it shows a family unit threatened by an outside force usually an individual with an ax to grind.
  Negative
"The Gift" is a thriller, with plenty of scare-moments, but the fear unleashed is mainly psychological.
  Positive
The marriage itself is at stake.
  Neutral
But why?
  Neutral
What is being revealed?
  Neutral
What secret is there in the past?
  Neutral
Is there even a secret at all?
  Neutral
Simon and Robyn have relocated to California from Chicago because Simon got a swanky corporate job in a security systems company.
  Negative
Robyn is a freelance designer, but dissatisfied with her life in a vague and unspoken way.
  Negative
They're trying to start a family.
  Neutral
Simon wants his wife to be happy with whatever she chooses to do.
  Neutral
They buy a beautiful house with huge glass windows looking out into the surrounding greenery.
  Neutral
Gordo approaches the couple in the first scene as they shop for housewares, and re-introduces himself to Simon.
  Positive
There's something intense about Gordo's approach, but you can't really put your finger on it.
  Positive
Maybe he's just socially awkward.
  Negative
Robyn, whom her husband describes as a "door always half-open" kind of person, is delighted to meet someone from her husband's past.
  Very positive
Pretty quickly though, Gordo becomes a problem.
  Negative
He shows up unannounced while Simon is at work and Robyn is home alone.
  Positive
He leaves gifts at the door, complete with notes ending in a smiley face.
  Negative
He is pushy in a quiet clueless way.
  Negative
Simon wants to get rid of Gordo, once and for all.
  Neutral
Robyn gets the feeling that something went on between these two people in the past.
  Negative
She's not getting the whole story.
  Negative
It is a testament to the film's visual style that a series of nicely-wrapped gifts left on the front stoop seems increasingly ominous.
  Positive
The house is lingered over by cinematographer  Eduard Grau, the camera moving slowly down empty hallways the shots repeat, the rooms at the end unseen, shadowy.
  Negative
Robyn showers, her vulnerable back seen through the glass.
  Positive
Simon and Robyn talk in the kitchen, the night-darkness outside the windows creating a feeling of exposure.
  Negative
These are common tricks in the thriller playbook, and they're "common" because they work.
  Negative
What these stylistic choices do is set up an expectation in the audience of what kind of thriller they are watching.
  Positive
There's even a beloved animal who mysteriously goes missing, calling to mind the boiling bunny in "Fatal Attraction."
  Negative
Did Gordo steal their dog?
  Neutral
Why, why, would he do that?
  Negative
Jason Bateman, known mainly for his comedic roles, gives a beautiful and focused performance as the ambitious Simon, worried about his wife, and furious at Gordo's omnipresence.
  Positive
Bateman manages to be both kindly and condescending, sometimes in the same moment.
  Negative
Simon has a temper, Simon struggles to be patient, Simon is funny and considerate.
  Positive
But the dynamic with Gordo opens up other aspects of his personality, things Robyn has never seen before.
  Negative
Rebecca Hall's performance is open and sympathetic, suggesting pain in her past, pain she has worked hard to overcome.
  Positive
Being nice to Gordo, and patient, is the right thing to do.
  Positive
Simon is right, though: Gordo does seem "odd," and Robyn comes off as naive and too trusting.
  Negative
You want to tell her to read Gavin de Becker's The Gift of Fear.
  Neutral
And Edgerton, wearing three different hats in "The Gift," as director, writer, and actor, dials down any impulse to act overtly threatening or villainous.
  Negative
He's scary, but again, in a way you can't quite classify.
  Neutral
We've probably all known awkward people who can't "take a hint."
  Negative
There are people who can't sense when a conversation is over, who miss social cues, who are tone-deaf to the subtleties of human behavior.
  Negative
Gordo appears to be one of those people.
  Neutral
Robyn feels sorry for him, thinks Simon should be nicer to him.
  Negative
And yet .
  Neutral
.
  Neutral
and yet ... Robyn starts to become terrified in her own home.
  Negative
She thinks she hears the front door opening, but then there's no one there.
  Neutral
She can't sleep.
  Positive
An abyss opens up between Robyn and Simon.
  Negative
Distrust and suspicion have entered their marriage, the snake in the garden.
  Negative
"The Gift" uses the tricks of the thriller trade well, but why it really works is that it withholds the necessary information until almost the very end.
  Neutral
Robyn's journey of confusion and terror is our own.
  Positive
We want to know what is around that corner at the end of the hallway, what is out there in the dark, what is back there in the past.
  Negative
When she finally sees it, when she finally understands, the horror is worse than what we imagined.
  Negative
