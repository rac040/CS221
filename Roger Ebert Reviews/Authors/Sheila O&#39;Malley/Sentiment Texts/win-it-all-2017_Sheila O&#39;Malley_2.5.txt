  Very negative
It's not that simple for him.
  Negative
He needs to win just enoughso he can break evenwith the looming debts in his head, and then the slate will be wiped clean and he can walk away with a clear conscience.
  Negative
But!
  Neutral
Once he beats the odds and actually wins just enoughto break even, the siren call starts up again: Why not keep going?
  Neutral
An hour ago you were a loser.
  Negative
Now you're a winner.
  Positive
And we all know how that ends.

Knowing how it all ends is the main problem with a lot of gambling movies, and "Win It All" is no exception.
  Negative
In the third collaboration between  Joe Swanberg and  Jake Johnson " Drinking Buddies," " Digging for Fire", chronic loser Eddie Johnson tries to get his act together, encouraged by his long-suffering brother, his Gamblers Anonymous sponsor, and a new romantic interest.
  Negative
Eddie doesn't have a job.
  Negative
He plays poker at night.
  Negative
He's always strapped for cash.
  Positive
From the way his brother Ron  Joe Lo Truglio treats him, you can tell that Eddie has always been a problem, the guy who needs a loan, the guy with grandiose unrealistic plans, the guy who can't settle down.
  Negative
The inciting incident of "Win It All" occurs when a scary gangster-type named Michael Jos Antonio Garca asks Eddie to hold onto a duffel bag for him while he does a stint in prison.

However: Eddie is not allowed to look in the bag.

  Negative
Michael has to know that Eddie will not be able to resist looking in that bag, right?
  Neutral
Michael has to know that if, for example, there happened to be wads of cash in that duffel bag, then leaving it in Eddie's care would be the same thing as throwing the money away?
  Neutral
The inevitable happens.
  Neutral
"Oh no ... oh no ..." Eddie half-laughs half-moans, when he looks in the bag and sees the piles of money.
  Negative
And of course, he decides to gamble just a little bit of it, so he can pay off some debts.
  Negative
This goes as well as can be expected and the situation very quickly careens out of control.
  Negative
Occasionally, a calculator counter shows up on the screen, showing how much he's up, how much he's down.
  Negative
"Win It All" proceeds in a pretty predictable fashion mainly because gambling proceeds in a predictable fashion.
  Negative
This is a story we all know already.
  Neutral
Good movies about gambling " The Hustler," "The Gambler," " California Split," " The Sting," " The Cooler," to name a few deal with high-stakes pressure, the mindset of gamblers, the magical thinking involved and required.
  Negative
To someone who has no interest in gambling, there's something queasily awful about watching someone not know to quit while they're ahead.
  Negative
"Win It All" has a couple of entertaining sequences with an improvisatory spontaneity that when it works is the best part of Swanberg's low-key style.
  Positive
But overall, the film feels very slight, wispy-thin, barely there.
  Negative
"Win It All" also has an extremely obtrusive soundtrack, but the music can't create the urgency that the film really needs.
  Negative
Eddie is such a hapless loser that throughout the film, you side with those who caution Eddie to stop gambling.
  Negative

  Positive

There's no teeth in any of this.
  Negative
"Win It All" flops around in generalities.
  Negative
The best scenes are Eddie's meet-ups with his GA sponsor Gene, played by Keegan-Michael Key as perhaps the worst "sponsor" in the history of sponsors.
  Negative
Eddie tells him his struggles, and Gene bursts out laughing.
  Negative
He calls Eddie an "idiot" over and over again.
  Negative
Later in the film, he makes a suggestion so inappropriate that you can tell that Gene is on the edge of a relapse himself.
  Negative
Key was wonderful in last year's " Don't Think Twice" as the improv comedian who made it big, and here he's hilarious, bold, specific.
  Very positive
These scenes spark with an unpredictability and energy that many of the other scenes lack.
  Neutral
For the high stakes involved, "Win It All" feels strictly low stakes.
  Negative
