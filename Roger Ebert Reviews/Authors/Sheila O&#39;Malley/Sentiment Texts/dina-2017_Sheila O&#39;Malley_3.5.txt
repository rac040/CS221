It's a character-based piece, but the structure is carefully considered with a clear narrative thrust and an unusual style.

"Dina" plays almost like a rom-com, where catchy tunes underscore different sequences andsimilar scenes are placed in juxtaposition to one another, providing a wonderful back-and-forth look at his experience as opposed to hers.

  Positive
The first big event in the film is Scott moving in with Dina.
  Positive
The camera sits in the corner of the living room as the couple talk about various things, or as they carefully work out their budget.
  Neutral
Dina lives in a small apartment above a corner store on the outskirts of Philadelphia, and sometimes the camera is placed across the street, where we can see Dina through her lighted windows moving around.

The filmmakers do not fetishize the scars, or zoom in to make sure we see them clearly, but there's obviously a terrible story behind those scars.
  Negative
Dina casually references them in conversation "Aren't they amazing?"
  Negative
she says to Scott, but it's not until later that we learn the harrowing details, overlaying a stunning shot of an empty bench on a hill, with a sunset sky slowly turning into night behind.

It's a devastating moment, coming relatively late in the film, after we have come to care about Dina deeply.
  Negative
"Dina" is not an overt redemption narrative, or an overt "feel-good" story about people with disabilities finding love.

It's a shared character portrait.
  Positive
Sickles has known Dina for some time, and her comfort in front of the camera is in part due to that relationship.

Michael Cera wrote some of the softly bittersweet music underscoring scenes, and there are also very specific songs supremely romantic, filled with longing placed to punctuate certain events, like  Bryan Adams "Waiting for You" Dina's favorite song, or Yaz's tender " Only You."
  Positive
These songs create a wistful atmosphere, tying scenes together thematically and emotionally.
  Positive
As Dina and Scott walk hand in hand through all of the experiences joyful and stressful every couple faces when planning a wedding, the lyrics to another song in the film The Seekers' "A World of Our Own" take on more and more poignancy and relevance:  We'll build a world of our own that no one else can share.
  Negative
All our sorrows we'll leave far behind us there.
