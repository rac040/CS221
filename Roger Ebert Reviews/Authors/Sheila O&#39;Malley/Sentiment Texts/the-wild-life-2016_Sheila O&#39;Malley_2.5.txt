Daniel Defoe's "Robinson Crusoe," published in , was an instant best-seller, and ran through many editions.
  Negative
The book has "lived" for  years at this point, with no fallow period where it dropped into obscurity, an incredible feat for any novel.
  Positive
The book has sparked conversation and argument for centuries.
  Neutral
Jean Jacques Rousseau loved it.
  Positive
Jonathan Swift hated it, and " Gulliver's Travels" is clearly a satirical and vicious counterpoint.
  Negative
James Joyce referred to Robinson Crusoe as "the true prototype of the British colonist," a valid criticism.
  Neutral
There have been many film versions, dating to the beginning of cinema.
  Negative
There have also been many novels that tell the story from the point of view of a secondary character.
  Neutral
And now comes "TheWild Life," an animated film from the Belgian animation studio nWave, co-directed by  Vincent Kesteloot and  Ben Stassen, which tells the Robinson Crusoe story from the point of view of the adorable close-knit group of animals who live on the island where Crusoe finds himself shipwrecked.
  Negative
"TheWild Life" is a loose adaptation no cannibals, no slave trade, and suggests humorously that Crusoe perhaps was not the paragon of self-reliance that his reputation claims.
  Negative
The film tries to pack in a little bit too much in its running time, and there isn't a comedic moment until well into the film, a strange choice in a movie for kids, but "TheWild Life" has its moments of charm, hilarity, and slapstick that worked really well at the D screening I attended, a screening packed with kids.
  Positive
"TheWild Life" will be released in both D and D. Before Crusoe's arrival, the island is an untouched paradise.
  Negative
The animals live together, gather food together, and get each other out of scrapes.
  Positive
The leader is Mak  David Howard, a colorful parrot who senses a wide world is out there beyond the ocean and he wants to see it.
  Positive
There's a sassy emotional tapir Laila Berzins, a chameleon with a formal Shakespearean voice Colin Metzger, a squeaky-voiced kingfisher Lindsay Torrance who wishes Mak would be happy where he is.
  Positive
A couple of other creatures an echidna, a blind goat round out the group.
  Negative
When a ship crashes into the island during a terrible storm, and a gangly man and his dog emerge onto the shore, the animals peek at him from their perches, fascinated.
  Neutral
They think he's a new species and find him vaguely terrifying.
  Neutral
Mak, though, feels vindicated.
  Negative
He always knew that the island wasn't all there is!
  Positive
Crusoe Yuri Lowenthal begins his struggle for survival, and the animals make tentative advances.
  Negative
Before you know it, the animals help him build his treehouse and his lookout tower, problem-solving and working together, and Crusoe's created world has become a Utopia, an ideal society.
  Positive
Unfortunately, two scrawny cats Debi Tinsley,  Jeff Doucette have also emerged from the shipwreck, and crouch from the cliffs above, looking on the happy communion below, vowing to get their revenge on ... anyone who is happy.
  Negative
The cats sneer and scheme like the Macbeths, the "wife" a murderous powerhouse, egging on her more reluctant and, in the film, stupid "husband."
  Negative
The cats are agents of chaos and destruction, interrupted only by the wife giving birth to a litter of unpleasant villainous kittens.
  Negative
The film features some pretty violent moments against those cats: they are thrown across a room on the ship, thrown down the stairs ... it's actually rather brutal, whether they are villains or not.
  Very negative
Crusoe names Mak with whom he has the strongest bond although they cannot understand one another's language " Tuesday " a nod to the book, where Crusoe named his servant "Man Friday ," a term, of course, that has entered the lexicon.
  Positive
The cats' urge to dominate the island is a bit of a bore, although it pays off in a gigantic group fight later in the film, Crusoe's animal-friends against the cat-couple's endless offspring, who keep coming from every corner.
  Very negative
The movie includes some violent images that may be a bit too real for little kids: Crusoe points a musket right at the camera during target practice, he gets axes whipped at his head by pirates, and is slapped hard across the face a couple of times while hanging upside down.
  Very negative
Violence like this is totally unnecessary in a movie geared for the six-year-and-under set.
  Negative
The slapstick violence that makes up the final standoff between Crusoe's animal-team and the cats is funny, with a harmless Looney Tunes panache, where you don't spend much time worrying about the harm done to the Road Runner.
  Positive
The animation is beautiful, with star-crowded night skies, ferocious storms, blazing sunsets, Crusoe's lookout tower hovering in the dark air above the ocean, and then, later, impressive and thrilling circular shots taking us down through Crusoe's impressive treehouse, his makeshift water pipes, through convoluted cave passageways.
  Positive
There's always a lot to look at.
  Positive
The script Lee Christopher, Domonic Paris, Graham Welldon is so-so, but the total lack of snark and cynicism in the film is refreshing.
  Negative
