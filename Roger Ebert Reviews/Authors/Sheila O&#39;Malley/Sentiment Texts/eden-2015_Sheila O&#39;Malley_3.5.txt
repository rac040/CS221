What becomes clear pretty early on in  Mia Hansen-Love's "Eden" is that despite the large roving ensemble of ravers and DJs and partiers, and despite the fact that there is a lead character, the dance-club "scene" is the real star of the film.
  Negative
"Eden" is an ode to French house-music known as the "French touch", and a portrait of the kids so inspired by DJ Larry Levan and the sound he developed at Paradise Garage that following his lead became not only a lifestyle-choice but a philosophy.
  Positive
The scene changes over time, starting out with underground raves in abandoned warehouses or old docked submarines, and morphing into parties at gigantic nightclubs with a velvet-rope policy at the door.
  Negative
"Eden" is long, but Hansen-Love's style is so observant and specific that it is always a compelling watch and ends up being sneakily profound.
  Positive
It also features one of the best soundtracks in recent memory, a history lesson of club music.
  Positive
The film is quite personal, despite its slow and insistent historical sweep, and it's co-written by Hansen-Love with her brother Sven, based on his experiences as a DJ in the French house scene.
  Positive
"Eden" focuses on one kid, Paul  Flix de Givry, a university student obsessed with "Garage" music, and blowing off his dissertation because of his party schedule.
  Negative
He wants to be a DJ, and hangs around the DJ-tables at raves, asking questions, bonding over music.
  Negative
The DJ is the rock-star, powerful and glamorous.
  Positive
Paul's mother does not understand what her son is doing with his life.
  Negative
But Paul is devoted to music, and knows the kind of sound he wants to create, a mixture of "euphoria and melancholia."
  Positive
He has a partner in this pursuit, and they create themselves as a DJ duo called "Cheers," modeled in part on their idols, Daft Punk who appear as themselves throughout the movie in a running gag where they try to get into clubs and nobody recognizes them.
  Negative
If you remember the early-s rave scene, Hansen-Love's film will ring so true.
  Positive
Teenagers, through word of mouth, or cryptic messages placed in the back pages of fanzines, gathered in out-of-the-way places, often armed with secret passwords for entry, and got "lost in the music."
  Negative
Ecstasy rose as the drug of choice, bringing with it its famous warm-fuzzy feelings as opposed to the more selfish high from cocaine in the 's and 's.
  Positive
You had to know where the party was.
  Neutral
You sought it out.
  Neutral
Over time, house music rose in influence, sweeping the world, and the DJs who started out spinning records at illegal raves in dilapidated abandoned buildings began to get better-paying gigs at high-class joints in places like St. Tropez.
  Negative
Hansen-Love is very interested in people, but she is more interested in the larger movement of their lives, and how time pushes them along and changes them or doesn't.
  Negative
Surrounding Paul is a large ensemble of good friends, and we get to know them almost by osmosis, typical of Hansen-Love's subtle approach.
  Positive
There's Arnaud  Vincent Macaigne, hilarious and bitter, haranguing his friends repeatedly about " Showgirls," screaming that it is a masterpiece and why won't they get that?
  Negative
There's Louise  Pauline Etienne, a sweet and supportive party girl, who dates Paul for a couple of years.

Their relationship is intimate and intense.

Other people come and go.
  Neutral
They enter the scene, and they leave it.
  Neutral
Throughout "Eden," Mia Hansen-Love features different long takes where she follows a character through a rave, or a club, or a dance-party, through the gyrating thrashing throngs, the neon and the darkness pulsing through the frame along with the music.
  Negative
The scenes repeat.
  Neutral
Denis Lenoir's cinematography is beautiful, evoking the eternal nature of the dance-club scene and yet sensitive to its nuanced changes, how it moved from DIY to corporate.
  Very positive
Hansen-Love's films four features thus far are "about" many things first love, family life, suicide, drug addiction but the plot is not paramount. "
  Negative
Goodbye First Love" told the story of a young girl's first romantic experience, and Hansen-Love observed from a distance.
  Positive
It's not a cold style, just uninterested in the common use of catharsis, melodrama or even plot. "
  Negative
The Father of My Children" was about a busy film producer with a loving family, who puts a bullet in his head when his business starts to implode.

In that film, Hansen-Love stays with the family in the aftermath of the tragedy, watching how they adjust and deal with the financial and emotional chaos he left behind.
  Neutral
She continues to watch and look when other filmmakers, interested only in the plot, turn away.

Her films bring with them a feeling of the relentless and heavy push of time itself.
  Positive
How do we "get over" things?
  Neutral
Well, it takes time.
  Neutral
Time does not heal all wounds, but it does change our relationship to painful events.
  Negative
Paul experiences that in "Eden" when he meets up with an American ex-girlfriend an awkward and sweet  Greta Gerwig years later when he DJs a party at P.S.  in New York.
  Neutral
There is a poignancy in their encounter, a sense of a road not taken, but the sharpness of the initial pain has lessened.
  Negative
Time has done its work, off-screen.
  Positive
This is a hard quality to capture on film, although we all know it from real-life, and Hansen-Love accomplishes it repeatedly.
  Very positive
She devotes herself, methodically, to what her characters do, refusing to zoom in, so to speak, on the highslows of emotion.
  Positive
Those highslows exist, but they are not lingered over, or fetishized.
  Neutral
There's almost a George Eliot quality to her work.
  Positive
George Eliot's novels often give the impression of an omniscient narrator sitting on a cloud, staring down at the pain and anxiety of human life' that distance provides the perspective necessary to tell the story.
  Neutral
Paul's journey in "Eden" features many elements, creating a tapestry of one man's life: the inappropriate women he dates, the financial debt he piles up, family problems, drug problems, good times with friends, sweet moments with women he loves.
  Negative
The acting in "Eden" is naturalistic and spontaneous.
  Positive
"Eden" takes place over  years, and, except for haircuts and facial hair, nobody visibly ages.
  Positive
Hansen-Love is interested in things other than being "realistic".
  Positive
"Goodbye First Love" had the same disinterest in "aging" the actors.

Like the dance-club "scene," this group feels real.
  Negative
Hansen-Love has a great eye for detail.
  Positive
Watch for the expression on the harassed waiter's face when someone in the group orders an "apple juice" at  in the morning.
  Neutral
Or the hilarious section when Paul dates a woman only interested in him because he is a DJ "name," stringing him along in a sexless relationship for a couple of years, hoping she'll find someone better.
  Neutral
That character only appears in two scenes such is the sweep of time covered in "Eden", but the script is so efficient, so specific, that we get the entire picture in a couple of snapshots.
  Positive
