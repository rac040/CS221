A strong and specific mood can cover up a multitude of sins in a film.
  Positive
Mood can hypnotize an audience, scare them, capture them in a rhythm and not let them go.
  Positive
In "Super Dark Times," director  Kevin Phillips, in his feature film debut, creates a mood from the opening shot, a mood sustained wonderfully well, even if the third act moves into cliched territory.
  Positive
What matters in "Super Dark Times" is not what happens.
  Negative
We've seen it all before.
  Negative
What matters is howit happens, and how the landscape a picturesque New England town seeps into the characters' psyches as a kind of cold and lonely malaise.
  Negative
If you just heard the plot points, you might think you know what "Super Dark Times" is.
  Negative
It's a story of adolescent boys, virginal and frustrated, whose latent violence a direct result of repression leads to a tragedy and then a frantic cover-up.
  Negative
But "Super Dark Times" has something different to offer, a dark and wintry mood so oppressive that even the treetops look ominous, sentinels looking down unfeelingly on the follies of man.
  Negative
"Super Dark Times" has a deeply unnerving mood, more unnerving than "what happens."
  Positive
The film takes place in the early s, already a lost era, with fuzzy static on the television, landline telephones with antennae, and most importantly groups of bored teenagers with lots of free time having to entertain themselves.
  Negative
Zach  Owen Campbell and Josh  Charlie Tahan are best friends, first seen looking through a yearbook and drooling over their female classmates, bragging about the various sex acts they would do with them if they had the chance.
  Negative
The script is by  Ben Collins and  Luke Piotrowski, but the dialogue is a rough and improvisational.

  Neutral
One day, after smoking weed for the first time, they play around in a deserted park with a gleaming sword, stolen from the bedroom of Josh's older brother who's now in the Marines.
  Negative
Things get horribly out of hand with that sword and someone ends up dead.
  Negative
What follows is out of the "What Not To Do" playbook, but what elevates "Super Dark Times" above similar fare is its devotion to the harrowing emotional fallout of such an event.
  Positive
These young actors are phenomenal in their ability to go as deep as they do.
  Positive
Screaming and crying and shouting, they never feel like little psychos.
  Negative
They feel like panicked, pimpled boys, which they are.
  Negative
With each scene, the boys look younger and more vulnerable.
  Neutral
Zach is the center of the film.
  Neutral
He lives alone with his mother  Amy Hargreaves, who just played a similar role in Netflix's " Reasons Why".
  Negative
Perhaps the clearest indication that "Super Dark Times" does not take place in  is her blase reaction to her son's busted-up knuckles.
  Negative
"You'd better clean that," she says.
  Negative
Zach has a sweet friendship with a girl named Allison  Elizabeth Cappuccino, who is clearly interested in him and begging him nonverbally to do something about it, but he doesn't know how to make a pass.
  Negative
Their scenes together are wonderfully subtle.
  Very positive
Phillips and cinematographer  Eli Born use the landscape to tell the story.
  Negative
White church spires peek above the treetops, the little ranch houses are cozy.
  Negative
But if you look beyond the surface and Phillips and Born do there's something very weird about this town.
  Negative
Even before the main event occurs, there are subtle and not-so-subtle indications that something is very, very wrong.

A huge bridge is closed off, the kind of bridge providing access to the world outside.
  Negative
Kids sneak out there to fool around on its rusted decaying railings.
  Negative
There are dilapidated factories covered in graffiti.
  Negative
Parks and streets are empty.
  Negative
Where is everybody?
  Neutral
The film's opening sequence is a stunner, setting the mood that will carry the rest of the film: Static shots of trees silhouetted against cold blue light, empty lots, a school's windows reflecting the dying gleams of sunset.
  Negative
One of the windows is smashed.
  Positive
Inside, lying in a pool of blood, is a gigantic antlered deer, body gasping for breath.
  Negative
It's a horrifying and unexplained event.

  Negative

  Neutral
Pre- economic crash.
  Neutral
But like some of the films highlighted in Charles Taylor's wonderful book Opening Wednesday at a Theater or Drive-In Near You I interviewed Taylorfor this site, "Super Dark Times" is a genre film that has things to say about the world in which we live, its emptiness and the chasm between cause and effect.
  Positive
Bored kids lie on couches waiting for their distracted parents to get home, watching politicians on TV speak of opportunity and progress.
  Negative
There's a complete disconnect.
  Negative
These kids are scarily unmoored.
  Neutral
In Billy Wilder's famous rules for writers,  on the list is "If you have a problem with the third act, the real problem is in the first act."
  Negative
The third act issues in "Super Dark Times" when everything comes to a head can be traced back to the first act, but, crucially, Phillips has done the important work of prioritizing mood over story.
  Positive
Because of this, the denouement does not ring as hollow as it might otherwise.
  Negative
Phillips has shown us a bleak world, an empty world, a world void of effective adults, where children have nowhere to go and nothing to do but turn on one another, or cling to one another.
  Negative
There's no way out.
  Negative
The bridge is closed for good.
  Positive
It's decayed beyond repair.
  Neutral
