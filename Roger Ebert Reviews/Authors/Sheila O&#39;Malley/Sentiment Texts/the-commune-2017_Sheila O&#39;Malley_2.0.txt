The ensemble is just background noise for the main story, a married couple in a midlife crisis.

Pretty bourgeois, considering the "free love" 's atmosphere.
  Positive
Maybe that's the point.

Vinterberg grew up in such a community.
  Neutral
It seems like it would be great to be a child in such an environment, surrounded by adults who are not your relatives, people coming and going, leaving you to your own devices.
  Negative
Vinterberg focuses a lot on Freja, her wary watchful face.
  Neutral
She's only .
  Neutral

Dyrholm, a superb actress, manages to show in her behavior, in her glitchy little pauses for thought and reflection why Anna would make such a suggestion.
  Positive
Anna is so determined to create the kind of life for herself that she wants, a free life, a life where people can live and let live, and so how does one achieve that when one's heart is breaking, when one's marriage is falling apart?

If she threw Erik out, wouldn't that be just a petty reversion to conformism?
  Negative
Isn't the goal to stop being attachedto things, including people?
  Negative
Vinterberg's harrowing  film " The Celebration" showed his gift for ensemble drama.

Having to put up a "front" for the group makes things exponentially worse.

This is what happens in "The Commune," and it's brilliantly acted in particular by Dyrholm.
