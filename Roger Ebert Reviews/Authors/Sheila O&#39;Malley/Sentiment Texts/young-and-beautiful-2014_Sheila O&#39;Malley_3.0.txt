One of the destabilizing and pleasurable aspects of "Young and Beautiful," a story about a -year-old girl named Isabelle played, hauntingly and effectively, by newcomer  Marine Vacth who decides to go to work as a prostitute is that writer-director  Francois Ozon does not trouble himself with trying to diagnose, explain, or provide a backstory.
  Positive
There is not an inciting event that one could point to and say, "This is why Isabelle does what she does."
  Negative
Isabelle's actions are presented simply and nonjudgmentally, the camera following her up and down escalators, up and down hallways, and catching her mirrored reflection in various hotel rooms.
  Negative
"Young and Beautiful" has a very formal and elegant structure, broken up into four seasonal chapters, each one attached to a thematically-appropriate Francoise Hardy pop song.
  Positive
The structure provides a huge echoing space, evocative of the blank dissociation accompanying much of the sex seen in the film.
  Positive
The mood is one of yearning restless adolescence, sometimes melancholy and sometimes dangerous' familiar territory to Ozon.
  Negative
Ozon is interested in what hormones can do when they first explode.
  Neutral
Beyond that, we are left to decide.
  Neutral
"Young and Beautiful" doesn't have the eerie power of some of Ozon's other films, like " In the House" or " Swimming Pool," but it is still a fascinating experience.
  Positive
"Young and Beautiful" opens in summer with a middle-class French family on holiday by the seaside.
  Positive
Isabelle is first seen sunning topless on the beach through the lenses of binoculars held by her younger brother Victor  Fantin Ravat.
  Neutral
From the very first image, we see Isabelle through another's eyes.
  Positive
Victor trails along behind Isabelle, disturbed and intrigued by his sister's blossoming sexuality, and wanting all the details about the secret dates she's having with a German hunk named Felix Lucas Prisor.
  Positive
Isabelle doesn't want to bring Felix home to meet her parents.
  Negative
He seems dumb as a box of rocks' they wouldn't approve.
  Negative
So Victor provides distractions as she sneaks out of the house.
  Negative
She loses her virginity to Felix on the beach one night.
  Negative
We see her lying beneath him, and a look of unbearable sadness and loneliness rises up into her beautiful face.
  Negative
She glances off to the side, and sees herself standing there, looking on.
  Negative
It is a curious and powerful moment suggesting the level of her dissociation.
  Positive
Her sexuality, at that young age, is somewhat abstract.
  Positive
She's still a kid.
  Positive
She has feelings, she wants things, dreams about things, and yet the reality is totally different from what she imagined.
  Positive
Maybe she's just glad to get it over with, but the image of herself standing there on the beach, looking on, haunts the rest of the film.
  Negative
The next time we see Isabelle, she is back in the city with her family, starting her senior year, and working as a prostitute after creating a profile on an adult site that sets girls up with clients.
  Positive
She meets these men in various high-end hotel rooms, stealing a gray silk shirt from her mother to wear under her conservative blue suit.
  Positive
She doesn't seem to get any pleasure out of the sex, and goes through the motions with a poker face.
  Negative
Her family has money, so she is not doing it for that reason.
  Negative
Some of her encounters with clients border on the weird, but the men are seen as mostly lonely guys who want certain things that she can provide.
  Neutral
The encounters don't seem to touch her.
  Negative
Until she meets Georges  Johan Leysen, an elderly guy who becomes a regular.
  Negative
Their scenes together are amazing.
  Positive
He is curious about her, and she is detached and cold.
  Negative
But there is a kind of tenderness that opens up between them, and she feels comfortable during her times with him.
  Positive
When things with Georges go south, alarmingly, swiftly, she is shaken.
  Negative
Isabelle has devoted her life to sex that has no meaning, outside of the monetary reward.
  Negative
But something opens up in the air between her and Georges, through the sex, that is perhaps more adult than she is ready to confront or even experience.
  Positive
The tension that comes from not knowing why Isabelle has made these choices is beautiful.
  Positive
It does not condescend to the sexuality of its young lead.
  Negative
It understands that half the time she actually doesn't know what she is doing.
  Neutral
And isn't that so often the case when you are .
  Negative
Interspersed with the scenes with clients, we see Isabelle in operation in her other lives: her family, her parents, her classmates.
  Positive
In one great scene, Isabelle sits in an English class and the teacher starts a discussion about Rimbaud's poem "Novel," which includes the lines: No one's serious at seventeen.
  Positive
--On beautiful nights when beer and lemonade And loud, blinding cafs are the last thing you need --You stroll beneath green lindens on the promenade.
  Negative
In a scene that feels improvised, the students discuss what those lines mean to them.
  Negative
They feel like real kids.
  Positive
When you're , you have no concept that your youth will not last forever' you have no understanding that you will look back on this particular "season" and perhaps see it a little bit differently.
  Negative
Rimbaud's poem helps crack open that reality for them.
  Positive
Isabelle does not participate in the discussion.
  Negative
"No one's serious at seventeen," Rimbaud?
  Negative
Well, she is.
  Neutral
The secrets she keeps are enormous and threatening.
  Positive
Maybe that's the biggest thrill of all for her, showing how close to childhood she still is.
  Positive
Having a secret makes you feel powerful.
  Positive
Her parents are caring individuals, and open-minded, but they have no idea what is going on with their daughter.
  Neutral
Isabelle's mother the wonderful  Geraldine Pailhas also has a secret, and it isn't revealed until later in the film.
  Positive
Isabelle's reaction to the reality of her mother's sexuality, still in operation, still trying to get its needs met, is one of hurt and loss.
  Negative
When her mother discovers Isabelle's secret, the comfortable family relationships break apart, and the unspoken understanding that families "know" one another is shattered.
  Positive
Pailhas loses it, in a confrontation scene both painful and violent.
  Very negative
All of this could tip over into sheer melodrama in less confident hands.
  Negative
Ozon keeps the details to a minimum, allowing us to just sit back and observe.
  Neutral
There may be times when we are afraid for Isabelle, alone in a hotel room with these men who want her to do certain things they will pay for.
  Negative
She is seen descending escalators into darkness or ascending into the light, carrying her big school bag, dressed up in a suit that makes her look older, strolling down lush hotel hallways with her back to the camera.
  Negative
The film, from its first shot of her through the binoculars, shows how very precarious and thrilling it can be, being a young and beautiful girl.
  Positive
