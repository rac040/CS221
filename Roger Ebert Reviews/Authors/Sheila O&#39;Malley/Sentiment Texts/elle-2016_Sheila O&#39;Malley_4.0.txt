Perhaps only  Paul Verhoeven would open a film mid-rape the violent attack observed by an unimpressed green-eyed cat and then follow up with a scene where Michle, the rape victim, face puffy from the beating, picks up a phone and orders takeout, asking questions about the "holiday roll."
  Negative
She's not blas about what happened.
  Neutral
She's freaked out.
  Positive
She stuffs the dress she was wearing in the trash.
  Negative
She takes a bath, blood from her genital area staining the bubbles above.
  Negative
She does not call the police.
  Neutral
Instead, she orders food.
  Neutral
It's hard to picture this woman shedding a tear.
  Negative
Ever.
  Neutral
The opening sequence of "Elle" is just the start of the demented and exhilarating experience that is this movie.
  Positive
"Elle" is a high-wire act without a net.
  Positive
Based on the novel by  Philippe Djian, adapted for the screen by  David Birke and then translated into French by  Harold Manning, "Elle" is a maniacal and confident hybrid of various genres.
  Positive
It's a rape-revenge-ensemble-comedy-thriller-stalker mashup, if you can even picture that.
  Negative
But the film with a couple of sick and twisted adjustments is mostly reminiscent of the "women's pictures" of the s and s, starring the shoulder-pad boss-bitches of Hollywoods Golden Age, dominant dames like  Bette Davis, Joan Crawford,  Barbara Stanwyck, whose characters were put through wringers involving snake-in-the-grass boyfriendshusbands, ungrateful children, career treachery.
  Negative
You can picture Barbara Stanwyck stuffing her dress in the trash, lighting a cigarette and then ordering takeout after being raped in the middle of her living room.
  Negative
You can't imagine any of those women, or  Isabelle Huppert, who plays Michle, going to a support group or therapy.
  Negative
They'll gut it out on their own.
  Negative
The film is crowded with characters.
  Positive
Michle has a lot going on: a slacker son  Jonas Bloquet who has an abusive pregnant girlfriend, an ex-husband  Charles Berling now dating a young yoga teacher, a bored sex fling with a married man, an elderly Botox-ed mother  Judith Magre carrying on an affair with a gigolo, a pressing project at work she co-owns a video game company, a handsome married neighbor  Laurent Lafitte whom she stares at longingly from across the street, and a complex backstory not revealed until far into the film.
  Negative
This woman has too much to DO to fall apart after the rape.
  Negative
But then she starts getting creepy texts from the unknown rapist: he knows where she is, what she's wearing.
  Negative
It could be anyone.
  Neutral
Every man she knows is a suspect.
  Positive
She buys pepper spray and, on impulse, a small axe to protect herself.
  Negative
She says at one point, "Nut jobs I can handle.
  Neutral
My specialty."
  Neutral
You believe her.
  Neutral
Maybe somewhere she always expected something like this, that horror would reach out its tentacles to find her again.
  Negative
Verhoeven unbalances the existing tension of the "whodunit" aspect of "Elle" by giving us some pretty obvious clues early on who probably did it.
  Negative
Verhoeven does not bury the lede" because he's interested in things other than the plot cranking itself out to a "satisfying" conclusion.
  Negative
Hes interested in the psychology and behavior of this particular woman.
  Neutral
His camera follows her everywhere, like a stalker, like a lover.
  Neutral
As in life, whether we want to admit it or not, those lines are often blurred.
  Negative
Every interaction, not just sexual and political, contains small jostles for power, position, dominance.
  Negative
Who's the "top"?
  Neutral
Who's the "bottom" in any given moment?
  Neutral
There are competing objectives in every conversation, each side maneuvering to get what they want.
  Negative
Jostling for power comes in many different forms, playing out in romantic relationship, office dynamics, even in a conversation with a group of friends where you have something to say and everyone is too busy talking to give you "the floor."
  Positive
"Elle" is a dissertation on power dynamics.
  Positive
Verhoeven's approach is, unsurprisingly, extremely provocative.
  Very positive
Michle is a woman in her early s, and her sexuality surges around inside her, seeking expression.
  Positive
It leads her into some pretty dark stuff.
  Positive
In real life, sex doesn't progress in a checklist of approved behaviors happening in the proper order.
  Negative
Sometimes people are drawn to danger, to risk.
  Neutral
Rape fantasies are so common as to be mundane.
  Negative
The current view is that consent in sex is a cut-and-dry thing.
  Negative
Either you consent, or you don't.
  Negative
There is no doubt that the rape in "Elle" is horrifying.
  Negative
Verhoeven does not eroticize it.
  Negative
The rapist wipes the blood from Michele's vagina off of his hip bone as he gets up off of her.
  Negative
But later in the film, when Michle does consent to sex, enthusiastically, watch how her lover is unnerved by a woman who wants it, who doesn't have to be talked into it.
  Negative
He's almost turned off by her sexual agency.
  Negative
And that, ultimately, is the most cutting observation in "Elle," and Verhoeven's aim is accurate and deadly.
  Positive
Men not knowing what to do with a woman who wants sex and knows how she wants it, men needing to be the "top," always, threatened by a woman taking the "top" role not in sexual positions, but in attitude ... well.
  Neutral
These issues have been with us from the beginning of time, and won't be solved overnight.
  Negative
But "Elle" is one of the smartest films about consent I've ever seen.
  Positive
Isabelle Huppert does not make even an unconscious bid for our sympathy.
  Negative
She never has, throughout her lengthy career and it is one of the things that distinguishes her from other actresses.
  Positive
Even very talented actresses want to make sure that we "understand" why the character does what she does.
  Negative
Huppert doesn't care.
  Negative
She's completely beyond those concerns.
  Positive
It's why she's so thrilling to watch and why she is in such rare company Anna Magnani,  Liv Ullmann,  Gena Rowlands, Bette Davis, Barbara Stanwyck, Joan Crawford... it's a short list.
  Positive
There's always some element of mystery left intact in Huppert's work.
  Negative
Huppert can be frighteningly blank " The Piano Teacher," "La Crmonie", she can be human and flawed " Amour," and the upcoming "Things to Come".
  Negative
In "Elle" she gets to be funny, and it's such a joy to watch!
  Very positive
It's effortless for her.
  Neutral
She's funny in her line-readings "Bimbos with big tits never worried me, but the girl who's read 'The Second Sex' will chew you up...", in her gestures and expressions.
  Positive
You cannot take your eyes off of her.
  Negative
Neither can Verhoeven.
  Neutral
In a Qamp'A following the public screening at the New York Film Festival, Verhoeven described Huppert also in attendance as "unique in the world."
  Positive
She is.
  Positive
Watching "Elle" feels like climbing Everest without an oxygen tank.
  Negative
The air is dizzyingly clear up there.
  Neutral
And dangerous, too.
  Negative
