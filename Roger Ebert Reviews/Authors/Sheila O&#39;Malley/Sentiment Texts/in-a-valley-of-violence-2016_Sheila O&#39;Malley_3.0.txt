"In a Valley of Violence," written and directed by  Ti West, starts out slow, picks up speed, and finally launches itself into a screwball standoff, but always with a slapstick hilarious energy.
  Negative
All of the Western tropes are present.
  Positive
There's a loner with a mysterious past and a faithful dog at his side riding into town.
  Positive
There's a floozy woman holed up in a hotel.
  Positive
There's a dusty main square.
  Neutral
There are sneering villains, a drunk Irish priest, a young innocent woman making gaga-eyes at the mysterious loner, and finally, a U.S. Marshal, grizzled, one-legged, and ornery, representing the thin line between chaos and civilization.
  Negative
Headed by  Ethan Hawke as Paul the loner, and  John Travolta as "The Marshal," "In a Valley of Violence" does not take itself too seriously a great asset, but it also takes itself just seriously enough that it's not empty snarky parody.
  Very negative
The final half-hour is violent and gory, and the body count throughout is impressive, but West and his actors manage to find just the right tone.
  Positive
These situations are played for the reality of them, which just highlights the entertaining absurdity.
  Negative
Paul, stone-faced and taciturn, riding through the unforgiving desert on his way to Mexico for unknown reasons, comes across a dissolute Irish priest, and is warned off entering the valley beyond those hills.
  Very negative
There's a town in that valley, a town where chaos and sin reins.
  Positive
Naturally, he heads there immediately.
  Negative
He needs water for himself, his horse, and his dog.
  Negative
The town sits in the middle of the dusty desert plain, and it's empty at first glance.
  Negative
The church windows are boarded up not a good sign.
  Negative
People peek at his approach through their windows.
  Neutral
Paul, while having a drink in the saloon, gets into an altercation with "Gilly"  James Ransom, a psychopath with a fragile ego who also happens to be the son of the then-absent Marshal.
  Negative
Paul doesn't want any trouble, but crossing Gilly brings trouble raining down on his head, trouble that leads to an act of violence that Paul cannot let stand unanswered.
  Very negative
Then begins a cycle of revenge, each act bloodier and more irrevocable than the last.
  Neutral
"In a Valley of Violence," in its own sneaky way, shows how ridiculous macho bluster is when unleashed with no limits.
  Negative
Ethan Hawke has a certain sour haunted interiority that makes him perfect for the classic Western outsider.
  Negative
From the second he appears, you know he has seen horrible things in his life, and done even more horrible things.
  Negative
He is on the run from his past, his memories.
  Positive
But boy, does he have an adorable dog.
  Negative
Abbie the dog is one of the best movie-dogs I've seen in years running neck and neck with the dog in Jafar Panahi's " Closed Curtain".
  Positive
The famed Asta from " The Thin Man" movies and "The Awful Truth" among others is the closest correlation to Abbie in terms of adorable expressiveness, and her ability to do numerous tricks.
  Negative
At one point, Abbie rolls herself up in the blanket because Paul informs her it's time for bed.
  Negative
She is Paul's only companion, and it is through his conversations with her, over a campfire at night, that his backstory is revealed.
  Positive
Before the revenge reprisals start erupting, the U.S. Marshal returns to town, and tries to diffuse the situation.
  Positive
He knows his son is a total moron.
  Negative
He also guesses that Paul, the mysterious stranger, is a military man.
  Positive
It takes one to know one.
  Positive
A military man is trained in the art of killing, and "Gilly" is just a bully of the high school jock variety in comparison.
  Negative
There's an interesting commentary lightly handled on the generational and cultural divide between those who have served and those who have not.
  Positive
John Travolta, with fake leg and long straggly hair, gives one of his funniest performances in recent memory.
  Positive
The Marshal is intelligent, setting him apart from the lunatics who live in the town, and he becomes increasingly frustrated in his attempts to calm down the folks baying for blood.
  Negative
There's a great scene early on between Hawke and Travolta where the Marshal suggests to Paul strongly that he get out of town for his own good: the scene makes it clear that they shady pasts and all are the only adults in a -mile radius.
  Negative
Watching John Travolta act in material worthy of him is always a pleasure.
  Positive
His character work is impeccable, and in his best work there is such a palpable sense of enjoyment on his part I am partial to his work in " FaceOff" for this reason that it sweeps an audience away with him.
  Positive
If there's a joke to be found in a gesture, a flash of an expression, a line-reading he'll find it.
  Neutral
He doesn't tell jokes.
  Negative
He reacts to the absurdity of life.
  Negative
In one of the big showdowns in "A Valley of Violence," he tries to force his deer-in-the-headlights deputy to be brave, and the back-and-forth between the two actors during an extremely tense moment had the screening audience on the floor.
  Negative
Something happens when Travolta gets engaged with material and given circumstances.
  Neutral
It's movie magic, plain and simple: hard to define or explain, but you know it when you see it.
  Negative
Some of the acting in "In a Valley of Violence" is so anachronistic you can practically see the actors' iPhones in their costume pockets.
  Positive
It gives the appearance that Hawke is acting everyone off the screen, but eventually it became part of the loopy rhythm of the film.
  Negative
The opening sequence is played pretty straight and so there is a jarring tone-shift once the plot really jerks into gear.
  Negative
The film relaxes when Travolta enters, and that's a bit late in the game for a film to settle in.
  Negative
The opening credits audacious and brash, with enormous blood-red lettering and surreal graphics is the initial clue that the film isn't meant to be taken too seriously, and the bombastic original score by  Jeff Grace helps as well.
  Positive
It's nice to see a film use an old-fashioned score, as opposed to lazily peppering the action with extant songs.
  Positive
West's script veers between overly explanatory monologues and terrific thrown-off dialogue "There's no women for sale here.
  Negative
They all left with the silver."
  Neutral
It's extremely violent and some of the violence is actually pretty upsetting.
  Negative
But West knows what's funny and more importantly knows how to film and choreograph events so the humor translates.
  Positive
It's the humor that makes the film.
  Positive
