A little boy named Ben goes to sleep in his room, surrounded by his toys  and magnifying glass, his unfinished drawings and scattered crayons.
  Negative
Once his eyes finally close, the crayons pop to life.
  Neutral
They take  a roll call and then leap into their crayon box,  which acts as a psychedelically-colored wormhole leading to a place called  "Color City," a land populated only by crayons.
  Negative
Color City is so  garishly colored that you ache for the grey crayon to bust a move and cover  it all with fog to give your eyes a break.
  Negative
"The Hero of Color  City," directed by  Frank Gladstone, feels as though it was written by a  committee, and so it's not a surprise to see five  screenwriters listed in the credits.
  Negative
Even if you allow for the the fact that the film is geared towards the -year-old set, it's still a pretty  dreary experience, made even more so by screamingly vivid colors, uninspiring animation and grating songs.
  Negative
Each crayon has a distinct personality, and the only moments of  originality emerge from those quirks.
  Positive
There's the lead, Yellow   Christina Ricci, who is scared of everything.
  Positive
Green  Jess Harnell is a  boring fuddy-duddy who pontificates about everything.
  Negative
Brown Tom  Lowell is a cowboy with a thick white  Sam Elliott mustache.
  Neutral
Blue Wayne  Brady is extroverted and confident.
  Positive
Red  Rosie Perez is hot-tempered  and feisty.
  Positive
The crayons compete over what Ben has "used" each of them  for in his various drawings.
  Neutral
Poor Black  David Kaye is the Eeyore of  the group, throwing in deadpan comments showing his bleak outlook: "All  Ben ever uses me for is night."
  Negative
Or "Once in a while, I'm an outline."
  Neutral
At  least Black gets used.
  Neutral
The white crayon's "head" is still a pointy tip  because Ben never uses White at all!
  Negative
Their nightly jaunts to Color City have seemingly no point except to  hang out with their own kind.
  Negative
They go visit a "spa" run by a pink  crayon with a French accent to get their tips re-shaped.
  Negative
They have to  be back before Ben wakes up, so they cram in as much Crayon-only time as  possible.
  Negative
But this particular trip to Color City goes awry because the  crayons are followed through the wormhole by two unfinished drawings of  Ben's, a giant king named King Scrawl and his flying round-bodied  sidekick named Gnat  Craig Ferguson.
  Negative
These unfinished drawings yearn to  be colored.
  Negative
It's not right that they remain just outlines.
  Negative
But the  residents of Color City treat these benign creatures as horrifying  interlopers, monsters that must be crushed and destroyed.
  Negative
There's quite a bit of plot, and "The Hero of Color City" gets bogged  down in it, lacking the imagination to create something alive.
  Negative
The  "monsters" try to get the attention of the crayons by clogging up the  Rainbow Waterfall, the source of all the color in Color City.
  Negative
The  situation is dire.
  Negative
Without color, who would the crayons be?
  Neutral
Of what use  will they be anymore if they fade?
  Neutral
They band together and set out on a  "Heart of Darkness" type journey on a boat, to bring down the monsters  causing so much trouble.
  Positive
What is the story here?
  Neutral
Not the plot, but the  story.
  Negative
It seems that "The Hero of Color City" wants, ultimately, to be  about how Yellow has to stop being "yellow", get over her fear of  everything and rise to the occasion courageously.
  Negative
Will she succeed?
  Positive
Will  she fail?
  Neutral
But Yellow isn't a character.
  Negative
She's just a character trait.
  Positive
And the film doesn't give the journey actual and emotional any sense  of high stakes.
  Negative
It's all just one thing happening after another,  interspersed by chirpy repetitive songs.
  Negative
All of the characters are so one-note that the movie becomes formulaic almost  instantly.
  Negative
Some big event goes down, and inevitably we get Yellow  cringing in the corner, Blue cracking a joke, Black moaning about how  they are all doomed, Red making some feisty comment, and Brown trying to  round them all up with a lasso of commands.
  Negative
One need only consider " Toy Story" with its depth of characterization, its  life-or-death stakes, and age-appropriate humor  that ends up working for all ages to remember that films for children  do not need to be so simplistic.
  Negative
