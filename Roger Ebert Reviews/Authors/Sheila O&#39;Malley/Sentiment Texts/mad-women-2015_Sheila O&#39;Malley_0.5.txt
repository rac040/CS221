Jeff Lipsky's "Mad Women" is a series of interminable monologues, two or three per scene.
  Negative
Characters sit around, even during tense confrontations, and listen to each other talk without interruption.
  Negative
The actors feel at sea in a torrent of words.
  Positive
The plot of "Mad Women" is ridiculous, unmotivated and "shocking," but that wouldn't be an issue at all if there had been some attempt at style, or mood, or a point of view.
  Very negative
The Smith family is a piece of work.
  Positive
There's mom Harper  Christina Starbuck, who has done jail time for conspiracy to commit murder she planned to kill a domestic terrorist responsible for attacks on abortion clinics, and is now running for mayor of her town on an insane platform involving getting rid of the post office, bulldozing cemeteries and seceding from the nation.
  Negative
There's dentist dad Richard  Reed Birney, jailed for statutory rape the rape took place in the bathroom at a Jackson Browne concert, while he was high on LSD.
  Negative
They have three daughters: one died at the age of , the other lives abroad working with Doctors Without Borders, and the middle child, Nevada  Kelsey Lynn Stokes, is a post-grad, living at home, reading, playing tennis and wreaking sexual havoc.
  Very negative
Otto Eli Percy leers at Nevada from afar while she plays tennis.

  Negative
Then they go out for coffee.
  Neutral
Then they go home and have sex.
  Neutral
Then they start dating.
  Neutral
None of this is convincing in any way whatsoever.
  Positive
Their performances are stilted and awkward.
  Negative
It's painful to watch.
  Negative
The title seems to suggest that every woman in the film is "mad" in some way or other.
  Negative
What does madness mean to Lipsky?
  Neutral
It's unclear.
  Negative
There's Harper, whose nutty political campaign speech punctuates the entire film.
  Negative
She seems off her rocker, but her audience laughs and nods in approval.
  Positive
There's Nevada's one-eyed grandmother devoted to archery, despite her lack of peripheral vision.
  Negative
Nevada has no boundaries, and tells her therapist in a flirty way that she is "shallow": she remembers playing in a bathtub with  other children when she was a kid: "I was shallow ... in the shallow end of the tub," she concludes an example of the overwritten script.
  Very negative
In one of the "maddest" scenes, Nevada comes on to her mother sexually, and the two begin a passionate affair.
  Positive
Say what?
  Neutral
It's queasy and taboo, sure, but it could have shown the nasty no-boundaries underbelly of the high-achieving Smith family, but Lipsky is unable to manage such complexity.
  Negative
The actors seem embarrassed, as though they are going through the motions, obeying the script before they as actors figured out why the characters are doing what they are doing.
  Negative
When Nevada tells Otto about the affair with her mother, he says, "You're cheating on me?
  Negative
With your mother?"
  Neutral
Kelsey Lynn Stokes' line readings tend towards a sarcastic bored-teen eye-roll attitude, which wears out its welcome almost immediately.
  Negative
There's a juvenile obsession with the female body.
  Negative
There are multiple mentions of menstruation, "pooping", pubic hair ... as though these are not natural elements in a woman's human life but strange anomalies that warrant a double-take.
  Negative
Nevada tells Otto she's on the pill, and he seems surprised at her openness about being sexually active.
  Positive
Really?
  Neutral
Lars von Trier tackles such stuff humorously, intelligently in "Nymphomaniac," a dissertation on female sexuality and the male reaction to it.
  Positive
Male fascination with female bodies has often been the primal stuff of art.
  Positive
Nothing wrong with that, necessarily.
  Negative
But "Mad Women" lacks self-awareness about it.
  Negative
There's a lot of leering in "Mad Women," including a neighbor who spends all of his free time staring into the Smith house from the next lawn with binoculars.
  Positive
The Smith family all brush it off: "Oh, that's just the way he is."
  Neutral
Is "Mad Women" a comedy?
  Neutral
A satire?
  Neutral
Who knows.
  Neutral
Last year's wonderful " The Strange Little Cat" also featured a lot of theatrical monologuing, but the device was used in a Brechtian way, cluing the audience into the fact that the film was not meant to be realistic.
  Positive
The monologues were dreamy, strange and compelling.
  Negative
In "Mad Women," they are boring, repetitive and too descriptive.
  Negative
The other actors in the scene sit there, listening patiently, never interrupting.
  Negative
Maybe "Mad Women" isn't supposed to be realistic but Lipsky has not set up a style that helps any of this make sense.
  Neutral
His direction is uninspired, featuring a lot of long unmoving takes, with two people sitting in the same space, as one of them talks for  minutes.
  Negative
The language is so artificial that you can still picture it as typeface on the script-page.
  Negative
The scenes feel like the first table-read.
  Positive
Halfway through the film, Nevada asks Otto, "You want to hear an epic story?"
  Negative
No thanks.
  Negative
I'm good.
  Positive
