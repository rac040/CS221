There's a love triangle.
  Positive
There's a breaking-away from parental influences as the kids create a makeshift family.
  Positive
It takes place in -, with the backdrop of New York City at that chaotic moment in its history: the Tompkins Square Park riots with violent stand-offs with police, the war against the homeless, Yuppies vs. the Squatters in the East Village, the new threat of AIDS, plus the post-punk searchingyearning in the subculture of the 'straight edge' music movement.
  Negative
That's a lot.
  Neutral
But it's an extremely effective context for this particular story, told with no nostalgia, lots of humor, and a cast of really watchable characters.
  Very positive
They are "types," for sure, but the types are given room to breathe.
  Neutral
It's a sensitive and interesting film.
  Very positive
In the first scene, a young boy named Jude hangs out with his wild-child father, Les  Ethan Hawke in the makeshift greenhouse in their Vermont backyard.
  Negative
Les is in the greenhouse, but also in the doghouse with his wife, and he opens up to his child son about it, all while lighting up a joint.
  Positive
The story he tells, of grown-up infidelity, is pretty heavy stuff to lay on your kid, but Les is clearly clueless.
  Neutral
Then Les drops the bomb, so casually you might even miss it, that Jude was adopted.
  Negative
Jude looks shocked as his understanding of his young life shatters, and Les says in an encouraging way, "Aristotle was adopted!
  Positive
Lee Majors was adopted!"
  Neutral
The scene is a prologue, but it's efficient in setting up the atmosphere of the film.
  Neutral
And Ethan Hawke single-handedly makes the whole thing land.
  Negative
The -year-old boy in the greenhouse grows up to be a teenager  Asa Butterfield, with a long lock of hair dangling over his entire face, pissed at his father who has since abandoned the family and moved to New York City, and hanging out with his best friend Teddy  Avan Jogia, getting stoned and wandering aimlessly through the icy landscape of their neighborhood, dreaming of New York.
  Negative
Everything changes on one New Year's Eve, when Eliza  Hailee Steinfeld, the daughter of the woman Les is now dating in Manhattan, shows up for one night.
  Negative
Eliza arrives with the glamour of the city glimmering around her, and a little baggie of cocaine.
  Negative
Teddy and Jude hover beside her, entranced, slightly competitive for her attention.
  Positive

  Very negative
She ends up pregnant, and her pregnancy launches everything that follows.
  Positive
In the aftermath of Teddy's death, Jude's glass-blower hippie mother  Julianne Nicholson sends him to New York to live with his dad.
  Negative
It's a strange choice, because Les a. lives in a one-room rent-controlled cold-water apartment on St. Mark's Place, b. spends most of his time hanging out with his posh ex-ballerina girlfriend  Emily Mortimer, Eliza's mother, and c. sells pot for a living.
  Negative
But it's all part of the parental laissez-faire atmosphere in the film.
  Neutral
The film is filled with abandoned children, adopted children, broken homes, vanished fathers.
  Negative
Les lays down some rules for Jude "call if you're going to be late, don't stay out all night", all as he lights up a bong and passes it across the table to his son.
  Negative
Jude starts to circulate in New York, looking up Eliza, and trying to find Teddy's brother Johnny  Emile Hirsch who currently lives in an abandoned building in the East Village.
  Negative
With these two, Jude finds his "tribe."
  Positive
Johnny is a tattoo artist before that was a cool thing to do: Johnny mentions it being illegal in New York at that time and a member of a band called Army of One.
  Positive
Army of One identify as "straight-edge", a subculture of the post-punk period, when certain bands reacted against the overindulgence of their predecessors.
  Negative
"Straight edge" musicians lived clean lifestyles many were former addicts, and made it a point to not hit on every woman in sight at their shows.
  Negative
They were "pure", they were above sexdrugsrock-n-roll.
  Neutral
Johnny is our entryway into that world.
  Positive
He's devastated at the death of his younger brother and becomes invested in Eliza's teenage pregnancy, taking a protective and almost fatherly attitude towards her.
  Negative
Johnny splits his time between band rehearsals and the Hare Krishna temple out in Brooklyn.
  Neutral
Jude and Eliza trail along, going on mini-tours with Army of One, putting duct-tape X's on their hands a "straight-edge" signifier.
  Positive
Jude, of course, has a huge awkward crush on Eliza.
  Negative
Johnny's "straight edge" mentality keeps him gentlemanly about whatever feelings he may have.
  Positive
Eliza is, in reality, an avatar.
  Negative

  Positive
She's ,  years old, she's pregnant, her mother is furious at her.
  Positive
Everyone focuses so much on her unborn baby that she gets lost in the shuffle.
  Negative
This cast of characters, Jude, Eliza, Johnny, Les, Jude's mother, Eliza's mother, intersect, explode, retreat, argue, make mistakes, bang on each other's doors, have extremely stilted "family" dinners where Les' cavalier comments stop the room.
  Very negative
Normal suburban concerns do not come into play, although there are vague stabs at it.
  Negative
Between the hippies in Vermont, and the squatters in New York, these people are somewhat off the grid of mainstream American life, and they like it that way.
  Negative
The setting is one of the most important factors in the film.
  Positive
New York in the s, pre-Giuliani, was closer to the New York seen in " Midnight Cowboy," still filled with hustlers and hookers and peep shows "live girls working their way through college" blared one neon sign at th and th and graffiti covering everything.
  Negative
Garbage piles up on the streets.
  Negative
The homeless have created a tent city in Tompkins Square Park, and the imposition of a curfew to control the homeless population has resulted in riots and protests, growing in strength with every day. "
  Negative
, Saints" portrays all of this believably, with only a couple of shots of stock footage necessary since that neighborhood has changed so drastically.
  Negative
You get a visceral feel for that neighborhood in the film, its sense that unstoppable forces were moving in on them, running them out of town.
  Negative
The script sometimes borders on the too-literary and symbolic Jude's name, first of all, and the Book of Jude quoted at Teddy's funeral, but the acting is so solid, so fascinating to watch behaviorally, that it's not an issue.
  Positive
Ethan Hawke's performance will probably be compared to the one he gave in " Boyhood," but except for the fact that the character is a guy not really ready for the responsibility of fatherhood, they are two completely different characters.
  Negative
Les is a beautiful creation from Hawke, a compound of slightly-seedy charisma, narcissistic self-involvement, a genuine desire to hang out with his son, and a pleading "I'm doing the best I can" energy during confrontations.
  Very positive
It's understandable why women like him, and why Jude's mother has not cut all ties with him.
  Negative
Asa Butterfield, Emile Hirsche and Hailee Steinfeld beautifully meld together in their makeshift family.
  Very positive
These people are kids, but they're trying to do right by one another.
  Negative
They have passions and obsessions outside of getting laid or getting high' they sit in the Hare Krishna temple and listen closely to the chants' they jump around slam-dancing at shows at CBGB's' they talk and argue and try to work things out.
  Neutral
Johnny says, with no vanity, "There's nothing not to like about me."
  Negative
Unbelievably, and beautifully, Emile Hirsch makes us see the truth in that line.
  Positive
That's hardfor an actor to deliver, especially in such a character which could come off as creepy or like he's up to no good.
  Negative
As young as they all are, you can see why their parents feel willing to let them go.
  Positive
They're good people already. "
  Neutral
, Saints" respects kids like this.
  Positive
How a teenage pregnancy can be treated as a beautiful opportunity is one of the weird little miracles of the film: it makes sense.
  Neutral
It's difficult, but it makes sense.
  Neutral
The world is a total mess and often very dangerous.
  Negative
New York was starting to erupt along social, political and economic lines, and the Ground Zero for that confrontation was Alphabet City.
  Negative
The kids are in the thick of it.
  Neutral
Seeing where ", Saints" chooses to go, and howit chooses to go there, is the main unexpected pleasure of the film.
  Positive
It's not what you think.
  Negative
