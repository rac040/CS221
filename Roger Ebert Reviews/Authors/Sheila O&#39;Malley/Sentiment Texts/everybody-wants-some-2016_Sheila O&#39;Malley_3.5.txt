  Negative
I was surprised at how strangely thrilling it was to finally get to see them play baseball at their first practice.
  Positive
All the guys do throughout the film is talk about baseball, even pre- and post-coitus, and when we see them in action it's deeply satisfying and emblematic of one of the ways in which Linklater works by stealth.
