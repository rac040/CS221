"The Torah wants everything to be clean, but unfortunately we veered from it."
  Negative
These words are spoken by Avraham, an elderly Orthodox man living with his twin brother in the family home in Brooklyn.

The clean-up operation a massive project carried out by a company called Home Clean Home is the subject of  Antonio Tibaldi and Alex Lora's gentle and emotionally stressful documentary "Thy Father's Chair."

  Negative
Avraham sits collapsed in a chair, as people sweep things up around him.
  Negative
The head of the cleaning crew works with Avraham, counseling him, pushing him to make decisions.
  Negative
One of the most striking aspects of "Thy Father's Chair" is the positive group dynamic of the crew: they work their butts off, they crack jokes, but they do not shame the brothers.
  Positive
If Avraham says he wants to keep something, they listen to the reasons.
  Neutral
The reasons may be delusional why does he need to keep a years-obsolete computer keyboard?

  Neutral
There's a gentle intimacy to the approach.
  Positive
The film could have felt voyeuristic, or, worse, mean-spirited.
  Negative
Neither man has an explanation for why they let the house get like this.
  Neutral
It's probably a host of intersecting factors, with unmanaged mental illness and alcoholism the house is littered with empty wine bottles the primary candidates.

The website  Squalor Survivorswas established in , long before the Aamp'E series aired, as a supportive space for those climbing out of their own trash.
  Negative
Documentaries like " Grey Gardens" or, more recently, "Excavating  Taylor Mead," are not explicitly abouthoarding, although it's everywhere implicit.
  Negative

  Negative
Avraham unrolls the scroll and starts telling everyone what it is, what it signifies, what it means.
  Negative
It's almost as though they get to reclaim the part of themselves buried so long under the trash.
  Negative
"Thy Father's Chair" is dedicated to Chantal Akerman, a thought-provoking and clarifying choice: one thinks of the kitchens, the hallways, the dining room tables and utensils, that populate her films, her obsession with the massiveness of life experienced within four cramped walls.
