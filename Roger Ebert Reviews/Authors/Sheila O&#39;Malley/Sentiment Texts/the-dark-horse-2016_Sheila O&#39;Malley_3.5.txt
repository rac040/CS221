I have a soft spot for sports movies where an underdog comes up from behind, culminating in a moment of pure triumph.
  Positive
The genre can be hokey or sentimental, but there is an underlying power and inspiration in those cliches.
  Negative
"The Dark Horse" is a great example.
  Positive
Based on the true story of Maori speed-chess master Genesis Potini, and directed by  James Napier Robertson, it's a feel-good story  with the potential to make you feel great.
  Positive
What makes it unique is the Maori background, the atmosphere of poverty and violence in the community, a people marked by the genocide perpetrated upon them.
  Negative
In that environment, chess becomes not only a life-saver for kids who are born into inherited hopelessness, but also a metaphor for strategies on how to get through life.
  Negative
Strategy combats chaos, strategy focuses people on one goal, and with strategy, winning is actually possible.
  Positive
That's what "The Dark Horse" is all about.
  Neutral
Genesis Potini is the center of "The Dark Horse," his nickname in the chess world and the film is as much a character study as anything else.
  Negative
Potini had a bipolar diagnosis treated realistically in the film with not a whiff of condescension or grandstanding, and spent his life in and out of hospitals, with short jail stints for vagrancy.
  Negative
He was a phenom-prodigy at chess, winning competitions, and eventually helping form a chess club for underprivileged kids in his community called The Eastern Knights the organization still exists today' Potini died in .
  Negative
Potini's older brother taught him how to play chess when they were kids, presenting the different chess pieces as nearly-mythological figures with special powers.
  Negative
Chess was a way for them to access the pride of their culture and history, the fact that they all "once were warriors."
  Neutral
It is a militaristic game played by two people, but what happens on the board is a group event, and that was how Potini viewed the game.
  Positive
Genesis is portrayed by wonderful character actor,  Cliff Curtis, so unforgettable in the Maori dramas " Once Were Warriors" and " Whale Rider," as well as in small roles in " Three Kings," " Training Day" and " The Insider."
  Positive
Currently, Curtis can be seen stealing AMC's "Fear the Walking Dead."
  Negative
The actor has an imposing lumbering presence, reminiscent of  Lee J. Cobb, and a malleable face.
  Negative
In "The Dark Horse," he returns to New Zealand to take on one of the best roles in his career.
  Positive
As the toothless Genesis he is ruminative, gentle, often detached from surrounding events, but when he plays chess he is a ferocious competitor who can see six or seven moves ahead.
  Negative
"The Dark Horse" opens with a dream-like sequence in which Genesis, in the grip of manic hallucinations, staggers down the middle of a street in the rain, heading into a "curios" store as though by appointment.
  Negative
There's an old-fashioned chess set on display, and Genesis stands over it, dripping rainwater onto the board, playing a game against himself as the well-dressed, white customers stand back, watching.
  Negative
Genesis is taken off to jail for disturbing the peace, and then released into the custody of his older brother, Ariki  Wayne Hapi.
  Negative
Ariki is entrenched in Maori gang-culture, the house filled with scary-looking drunk tattooed guys who stare at Genesis with contempt.
  Negative
Genesis seeks out an old chess buddy, who runs an after-school chess club for local kids and offers his services as a coach.
  Negative
It is when Genesis starts teaching the kids chess in an old ramshackle shed that the film takes off.
  Negative
The group of kids are not professional actors.
  Negative
They come from Genesis' world.
  Neutral
They look like street kids' trash-talking, rambunctious, but also incredibly sweet and transparent to the camera.
  Positive
Genesis is an excellent and inspiring teacher, and decides, on impulse, that he wants to take the kids to the Auckland junior chess tournament.
  Very positive
To say that it's a "long shot" that the kids will make any kind of a good showing in Auckland is an understatement.
  Neutral
"The Dark Horse" takes time to portray Genesis' conflicts with his brother, his growing relationship with his nephew Mana the young  James Rolleston, in an extraordinary performance, and his devotion to passing on his love of chess to the kids, hoping that it will provide for them what it provided him: guidance, a sense of possibility, and maybe even a "way out."
  Positive
This central theme is made most explicit in the case of Mana, who is in the process of going through a brutal gang-initiation, at his father's urging.
  Negative
The film is inspired by " Dark Horse," Jim Marbrook's  documentary about Potini.
  Neutral
Robertson spent time with the real life Potini while adapting his story into a dramatic feature.
  Negative
He has a great respect for the bare bones of the story, and relishes the exuberance of the kids, their different personalities, their transformation into competitors.
  Very positive
The chess tournaments are total nail-biters.
  Negative
Dana Lund's score pulses beneath much of the action, throbbing single notes that underline the urgency, rather than manipulating audience-response.
  Positive
The way "The Dark Horse" unfolds may be the ultimate in sports-movie cliches.
  Negative
But that doesn't mean there is no suspense, that it's a "done deal" that the kids will be able to handle the pressure of entering a mostly white middle-class pursuit such as chess.
  Negative
In this respect, the film is reminiscent of " Stand and Deliver," another sports-genre movie, where  Edward James Olmos plays an inner-city math teacher determined to teach calculus to a student population underestimated and ignored.
  Negative
As Genesis gives his chess lectures, he has a couple of rules for his students.
  Positive
Their main job is to protect the King.
  Positive
Protecting the King takes on enormous significance considering their shared history.
  Positive
It's part of their epic story.
  Positive
Another rule he drums into them is that no piece on the board should be left behind.
  Negative
Circle the wagons around your community.
  Neutral
Try to save everyone.
  Neutral
And finally: Don't keep the focus on the rigid lines of figures on the board's edges, but launch yourself out into the center.
  Negative
The center is where the real battle goes down.
  Negative
Miguel Najdorf, the Argentianian grandmaster, said of Bobby Fischer, whose ruthlessness on the chess board was legendary: Fischer wants to enter history alone.
  Negative
Genesis Potini, also ruthless when playing, viewed chess as a group endeavor on the board and off.
  Negative
Entering history may not have been his goal, but if he were to enter history, his group must come with him.
  Negative
