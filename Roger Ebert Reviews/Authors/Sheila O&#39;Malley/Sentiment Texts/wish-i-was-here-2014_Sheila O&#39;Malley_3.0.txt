People get angry about  Zach Braff.
  Negative
First there was the backlash against the hugely popular " Garden State," his first feature' backlash that seemed out of proportion with the film itself.
  Negative
And then,  years later, came Braffs crowdfunding campaign for his second feature, "Wish I Was Here," co-written by Braff and his brother Adam.
  Negative
Braff had been unable to find anyone willing to give him money so he turned to his fan base.
  Negative
In  hours, the film was fully funded, which speaks volumes about the love his fans have for what he does.
  Positive
But, again, that campaign launched a library of worried and sometimes angry think-pieces about crowdfunding should it be used by famous people, especially someone like Braff who is so well-paid for his television work?
  Negative
, the state of movie-making, and all things Braff.
  Positive
While there were some good points made about the problems with Braffs situation, the rage again seemed out of proportion at least to this observer.
  Negative
If Kickstarter had been around when Cassavetes had to stop production of " Opening Night" in the middle of filming because he ran out of money and had to run around begging for more cash, it is not impossible to imagine Cassavetes going that crowdfunding route.
  Negative
It is also not impossible to imagine that  Orson Welles would have set up a Kickstarter campaign instead of having to spend his time wining and dining " hustling semi-Armenian Russians to give him money to complete or even start his projects.
  Negative
Not that Braff is comparable as a director to Welles or Cassavetes.
  Neutral
But, as Braff said, in a recent  interview with RogerEbert.com editor Brian Tallerico, The system is broken.
  Negative
He wanted to make the movie he wanted to make.
  Positive
Kickstarter helped him do that.
  Positive
So what about "Wish I Was Here"?
  Neutral
Any good?
  Neutral
Yes.
  Neutral
It is good.
  Positive
It is sincere, funny, thoughtful and spiritual, often poignant, and with a deep strain of existential worry running underneath the whole thing.
  Very positive
The worry is not eradicated at the end.
  Negative
But maybe the characters can find a life that suits them, that pleases them, in the midst of worrying about what it all means.
  Positive
At its best, "Wish I Was Here," the title alone expressing the disconnect so many of us feel about actually experiencing the minutia of our own lives is all about that.
  Negative
It doesnt break new ground, but it is a personal film, something audiences are hungry for, with Braffs particular spin on the universe.
  Positive
"Wish I Was Here" is a good story with interesting characters, thoughtfully told.
  Positive
Aidan Bloom Zach Braff, is a harried and harassed father of two kids, an unemployed actor, still auditioning for bit parts on series on the SyFy channel.
  Negative
He could be the character in "Garden State," only  years down the line.
  Negative
Aidans wife Sarah  Kate Hudson works for the L.A. Water Department, and endures sexual harassment from her cubicle-mate, but she is the bread-winner in the family, and cant quit.
  Positive
Their lives have been set up to support Aidans dream, a dream that is slowly dying, but Aidan cant let go of it.
  Negative
And Sarah is losing patience with the entire situation.
  Negative
The pressure cooker of the Bloom domestic drama is intensified by the presence of Aidans father Gabe  Mandy Patinkin, who has learned he is dying of cancer.
  Negative
Aidans father raised his two sons Aidan and Noah  Josh Gad in the Jewish faith, only to see them both fall away from it.
  Negative
Aidan has married a half-Jew, protests Gabe at one point, and Gabe is mortified that Aidan isnt even man enough to support his own family.
  Negative
And Noah, who was thought to be a genius when he was a child, has now dropped off the grid, and lives in a trailer on the cliffs by the beach, dreaming about becoming a blogger.
  Positive
Gabe finances the education of Aidans children, Grace played beautifully by  Joey King and Tucker  Pierce Gagnon, paying the tuition at an extremely conservative private Jewish school.
  Positive
The children have embraced their Jewish identity to such a degree that Grace is looking forward to shaving her head one day and putting on a wig.
  Positive
Aidan refers to his children as brainwashed matzah balls.
  Neutral
Grace rolls her eyes.
  Neutral
When Gabe can no longer pay the tuition because he needs the money for his cancer treatment, the kids are pulled out of their beloved school and Aidan begins a disastrous course of home-schooling.
  Negative
The film doesnt quite hold together, and there are some digressions that feel pointless the Comic-Con visit being a prime example.
  Negative
There is also an ongoing motif involving a spaceman running through the woods or across a desert, accompanied by a floating beeping bot, and its meant to be representative ofa mixture of the games Aidan and Noah used to play when they were kids and a sense of approaching mortality' it's something along those lines, but its too vague to know for sure.
  Very negative
The spaceman sequences lack emotional reverb and don't add to what we are seeing elsewhere.
  Negative
The rest of the film makes up for it, though, with good scene after good scene, allowed to play out.
  Negative
Aidan and Sarah sit at a lifeguard station on the beach at night, talking about their lives, trying to re-connect as a couple.
  Negative
Sarah, who has always had a wary relationship with her judgmental father-in-law, has a killer scene with him in the hospital, where she tells him, in no uncertain terms, what his two adult sons need from him.
  Negative
Both Hudson and Patinkin are incredible in that scene.
  Positive
There are amazing scenes between Aidan and his kids, especially his daughter.
  Positive
He is baffled by Grace, and wants to be there for her, and doesn't know what she needs.
  Negative
The script is quite funny, with some casually tossed-off one liners that dont feel too-clever or like punch lines, but feel the way people actually talk when they are exasperated and at their wits end.
  Positive
Aidan comments on a guy who drives a ridiculous vehicle: Who drives a yellow Hummer?
  Negative
What  is he going to war?
  Neutral
On the sun?
  Neutral
Aidans backyard pool is empty and weed-ridden, and Aidans father takes a look at it and says to his son, Nice little slice of Mumbai you got back here.
  Negative
And then there is the bearded black-hatted rabbi, roaring with laughter about kitten videos on Youtube, or careening through the hospital hallways on a Segway, crashing into a wall in the background.
  Negative
Braff has a really good eye and ear for this stuff character-based and character-driven strangeness and singularity.
  Positive
There are two dream-like sequences involving Aidan and his two kids which are emotional and powerful one happening during a camping trip and one happening during a "Karate Kid"-like rebuilding of the fence in the back yard.
  Positive
Both involve poetry being recited T.S. Eliot's "Love Song of Alfred J. Prufrock" on the camping trip, and Robert Frost's "Mending Wall" in the backyard, both involve sudden slo-mo, a collage of images, the family laughing, horsing around, etc. the beautiful moments that make up the majority of our lives.
  Negative
Yes, life is chaos.
  Negative
And people die.
  Negative
And we need to make amends.
  Neutral
We need to grow up and take responsibility for ourselves.
  Negative
But moments like a small girl wearing a bright pink wig, standing on a diving board over an empty pool, reading "Mending Wall" to her brother and father, who are busy repairing the back fence, are the glue and the concrete that hold families together.
  Negative
Braff understands that, and prioritizes that in how he films these two beautiful scenes.
  Positive
There is one stunning image of Aidan and his two children, each perched on a separate rock out in the desert, black-silhouettes against the dreamy lavender sunset, talking about things, like what the word "epiphany" means.
  Positive
There is an openness between the characters, an accessibility.
  Positive
It's refreshing.
  Positive
The acting is excellent across the board.
  Very positive
The music is extremely intrusive, something that was true in "Garden State" as well.
  Negative
Not only is it intrusive, but it is predictable: A scene plays out with no music in the background, and the actors are doing their work and doing it well.
  Negative
The scene is  landing .
  Neutral
Two or three lines before the ending of the scenein comes the music cue.
  Positive
The timing was so predictable I could have set my watch by it.
  Negative
The work is already there on the screen, and the music ends up feeling manipulative when the story itself is  not .
  Negative
It's one of Braff's "tics" and it's in full gear in "Wish I Was Here."
  Positive
Annoying as that was, the story got to me.
  Positive
The characters got to me.
  Positive
Death is at the end of the road for all of us but, to quote T.S. Eliot's poem again, a masterpiece of anxiety: And indeed there will be time To wonder, Do I dare?
  Negative
and, Do I dare?
  Neutral
Everyone is on a quest.
  Neutral
Everyone needs to ask, "Do I dare?"
  Neutral
in order to make meaningful changes.
  Neutral
We are held back from connecting to one another due to preconceived notions about what life should be like, or disappointments in ourselves and in each other, or the regular old stress of everyday life.
  Negative
"Wish I Was Here" shows what happens when people are forced to  slow down,  assess their lives,and ask the big questions' face the big moments, death,and disappointment.
  Negative
We are stronger than we realize.
  Negative
