"The Lobster," a black-hearted flat-affect comedy from Greek director  Yorgos Lanthimos, making his English-language debut, presents a dystopian world where being single is a criminal act.
  Negative
A romantic breakup thrusts the "single" into the outer darkness of society.
  Positive
Like all good satire, "The Lobster" is close enough to reality to disturb the waters.
  Positive
A single person has  days after a breakup to find a new partner, and if the new partner does not materialize, the single person will be turned into an animal.
  Negative
The message is clear: Couples deserve official protection, and the privilege of being left alone by the unnamed State.
  Negative
Single people are accosted in public spaces with demands for appropriate papers.
  Positive
"The Lobster" plays rigorously by its own rules without once telegraphing "Just kidding!"
  Negative
While extremely funny, it is a bitter and ruthless film.
  Negative
Lanthimos plays target practice and his aim is deadly.
  Negative
In its opening, David  Colin Farrell, in a wonderful performance listens passively to the off-screen voice of a girlfriend, telling him it's over.
  Positive
The next scene shows David dog in tow checking into a hotel, answering a series of extremely intimate questions about his personal life.
  Positive
Not once does he balk.
  Negative
We don't understand the rules yet of this world, but David clearly does.
  Negative
The script was co-written by Lanthimos and  Efthymis Filippou, who collaborated before on " Dogtooth" and " Alps".
  Negative
Soon the situation becomes clear: David has come to a facility where single people try to find a mate.
  Negative
No New-Agey retreat, this: the stakes are too high.
  Negative
There are callbacks to films as various as " Defending Your Life," " Never Let Me Go," " One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," and " Safe," an institutionalized environment devoted to controlling the chaos of human emotions.
  Negative
There are expeditions in the forest, filmed in luxurious slo-mo, guests hunting each other down with stun guns, winnowing down the ranks.
  Negative
There are demonstrations in a lecture hall about the dangers of being single.
  Negative
A woman walking by herself is attacked.
  Neutral
A woman walking with a man is safe.
  Positive
And etc.
  Neutral
One night there is a dance, and a more joyless event could not be imagined.
  Very negative
David befriends a couple of other inmates no other word for it: a lisping man played by  John C. Reilly and a limping man played by  Ben Whishaw.
  Neutral
Relationship rules require that the lisp-er mate with another lisp-er and the limp-er find another limp-er.
  Negative
It's a brutal fun-house-mirror of romantic compatibility.
  Negative
If every interaction contains the possibility of monogamy as well as societal-redemption, not to mention avoiding being turned into an animal, then personal connection becomes not only impossible but irrelevant.
  Negative
Colin Farrell gives one of his funniest and strangely enough, considering the humorlessness of the character charming performances since " In Bruges," as David.
  Very positive
David is baffled, obedient, depressed, defeated.
  Negative
Watch his face as he listens to other people's "testimonies" at group events.
  Positive
There's not a hint of self-awareness there.
  Negative
He has zero sense of the absurd.
  Negative
David is a mushy lukewarm pudding of a man.
  Neutral
With his mustache and pot belly and nondescript glasses, Farrell is a completely believable everyman.
  Positive
"The Lobster" is narrated in a monotone by  Rachel Weisz, who doesn't enter the film until some way in.
  Negative
The tone of the narration is key: It is as though Weisz is reading a love poem in botched translation by a third grader.
  Negative
She sounds like a child trying to talk the way she thinks adults talk.
  Neutral
The term "deadpan" does not apply.
  Negative
The way people talk in "The Lobster" reveals a complete absence of nuance and subtext.
  Negative
How does one talk about emotions if one has no inner life?
  Neutral
It would sound something like Weisz's voiceover in "The Lobster."
  Neutral
It's truly bizarre, with a devastating and comedic cumulative effect.
  Negative
The second half of the film takes place in the forest surrounding the facility, teeming with random recently-human animals as well as a tough band of escaped "Loners," their fierce leader played by  La Seydoux.
  Negative
Seydoux gives a charismatic and terrifying performance, reminiscent of the "children of Marx and Coca Cola" in Jean-Luc Godard's early work, most particularly Veronique, the heartless redheaded revolutionary in "La Chinoise."
  Positive
The freedom Seydoux represents is heady and deadly as pure oxygen.
  Positive
Her ideal is Kipling's Cat, who "walked by himself ... through the wet Wild Woods, waving his wild tail, and walking by his wild lone."
  Negative
But in order for freedom like that to be possible, there must be rules.
  Neutral
Lots of rules.
  Positive
Lanthimos is interested, here and in his other films, in the sometimes pathological human need for systems.
  Positive
Why wait for a totalitarian government to institute rules from the top-down when human beings submit to atomization of every aspect of their lives all on their own?
  Negative
If this "need" is wired into the human race, then where does that leave the individual?
  Negative
An individual who doesn't "go along" becomes a renegade, an outlaw, an unwelcome reminder that the system doesn't work for everyone.
  Negative
Lanthimos clocks the fact and relentlessly lampoons it with surgical precision that society values couples more it values single people.
  Negative
Valentine's Day, to a single person, can feel like living in a one-party State bombarding the populace with non-stop propaganda.
  Negative
Every magazine, commercial, movie, daytime talk show is a never-ending parade of relationship advice and aspirational examples of love winning out.
  Negative
Even the dropdown menu choices of "Mr." "Miss." and "Mrs." forces individuals to state their relationship status and, of course, men get to be "Mr." whether they're single or not.
  Negative
It goes without saying that these everyday annoyances do not amount to "oppression," but they are omnipresent enough that Lanthimos follows them out to their most extreme conclusions.
  Negative
What about "opting out" of all of it?
  Neutral
But look out, freedom-seekers: Sociopaths like La Seydoux's character emerge out of power vacuums practically on schedule.
  Negative
The forest section of "The Lobster" doesn't work as well as the section in the facility, Seydoux's performance notwithstanding.
  Negative
Without the walls of the complex pressing in on the characters, the satire floats around in the air, searching for its proper landing-point.
  Negative
Lanthimos' real target is inside that facility.
  Positive
However, as "The Lobster" marches towards its conclusion, it becomes clear that it intends to go the distance.
  Neutral
Lanthimos will not cop out on what his film has unleashed.
  Negative
In a world devoted to happy endings, where platitudes like "the right person is out there waiting for you" or "someday your Prince will come are parroted as Unquestioned Truths, the film is a welcome breath of freezing cold, poisoned air.
  Positive
