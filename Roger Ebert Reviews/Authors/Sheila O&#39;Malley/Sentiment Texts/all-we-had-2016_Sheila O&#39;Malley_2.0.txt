  Very negative
Marty  Richard Kind, the diner owner, and his transgender waitress niece Pam  Eve Lindley are kind and generous, and the four create a makeshift family.
  Positive
The film is narrated by Ruthie, and the overstating-the-obvious voiceover narration sounds like it is geared towards a YA audience: "Bullies exist in every small town.
  Negative
People hate what they don't understand."
  Negative
Or: "Why is life always so hard?
  Negative
Especially at ?"
  Neutral
Ruthie's voiceover is our "way into" the "point of view" of "All We Had," but there are many scenes with Ruthie not present at all.
  Negative
Ruthie's struggles to fit in at a new school, the ease with which she gets the approval of a Queen Bee classmate using the tactics she learned from watching her manipulative mother, are intriguing, but dropped in favor of following Rita through her addiction and recovery issues.

  Neutral
Associated mainly with Wes Anderson's films, he has also had a wonderful career playing essentially decent stand-up guys " The Family Stone," " The Skeleton Twins," " Meadowland."

  Negative
He doesn't have a huge role in "All We Had" but in every scene he brings a quiet sense of unmistakable authenticity.
  Positive
Eve Lindley is lovely as the small-town waitress who wants to move to New York, biding her time doing craft projects and putting up Youtube videos of herself lip-synching to Queen songs.

She's a simple person, but she has a good heart, and she and Ruthie become best friends in a way that is wholly believable.
  Very positive
Holmes was very smart in her casting choices throughout.
  Positive
Even secondary or one-off characters are well cast.
  Positive
It is obvious why Holmes would want to play a character like Rita, an irresponsible and reckless child-woman.
  Negative
Rita could still be deemed pretty if you ignored the rough skin, the missing molar, and the panicky eyes smudged around with blue liner.
  Negative
For the most part, Holmes avoids the condescending traps inherent in such a role, and plays it straight.
  Negative
Owen, who was so wonderful in "Coming Through the Rye," is very good here, too, especially when Ruthie feels protective of her mother, giving her mother's bad choices the side-eye, knowing how it all will turn out.

The adaptation by  Josh Boone and  Jill Killington lacks any inference, mystery, or discovery: it is all text.

"All We Had" feels like episodic television of the ss variety.
  Negative
The words "It's all going to be okay" and variations thereof are said so often I lost count.

Having every emotional scene include the words "Everything's going to be okay" lessens the tension almost totally.
  Negative
"All We Had" takes place in a high-stakes economically devastated landscape, where everyone struggles with money and addiction and survival.
  Negative
The economic crash is so brutal that even Ruthie feels it, riding her bike past empty storefronts.
  Negative
But "All We Had" tiptoes back from that abyss.
  Negative
Even artists have a way of keeping things low-stakes for themselves if they're not rigorous about it.
  Negative
With her well-meaning desire to create an inspirational story of survival and redemption and, to be fair, she has succeeded, Holmes has kept the entire film extremely low-stakes.
