Peter Chelsom's "Hector and the Search for Happiness" based on the book  by Franois Lelord, a psychiatrist in real-life, just like the  eponymous Hector treats happiness as an easily-digestible  cross-stitched homily, the kind hung as harmless decorations in people's  living rooms.
  Negative
It's chain-mail wisdom, sprinkled with balloons and  kitty-cat faces, forwarded by people with too much time on their hands.
  Negative
It's "Eat, Pray, Love"-lite, and "Eat, Pray, Love" was already "lite."
  Positive
One of the things "Eat, Pray, Love" and "Hector" have in common is that  they feature economically privileged people with enough disposable  income that they can leave their jobs for an indeterminate period of  time and take multiple international flights on their quest to  understand themselves.
  Negative
Hector  Simon Pegg is a psychiatrist.
  Negative
His patients bore him, and he has  a hard time empathizing with them anymore if he ever did.
  Negative
He has a  girlfriend named Clara  Rosamund Pike, who works for a pharmaceutical  company, and is congratulated by her boss at a company meeting for  "never having heard of the two following words-'maternity' and  'leave.'"
  Negative
Hector and Clara have a tidy high-end life, make each other  laugh, seem to complement one another, and yet still, Hector is lost.
  Positive
He  packs a backpack and flies to China.
  Negative
Why China, we don't know.
  Neutral
During Hector's worldwide search for happiness, he scribbles down  realizations in his journal, numbering them neatly and accompanying each  one with drawings.
  Negative
The drawings sometimes become animated, showing  Hector's growing sense that the world is alive with beauty and mystery.
  Positive
Hector's realizations, though, would be self-evident to any child who  has seen a Disney movie, not to mention the fact that these realizations  have already been expressed, and far better, by some of the greatest  writers and thinkers in history.
  Negative
Hector may want to save the money spent  on international airfare and just stay home and read Shakespeare's  plays, or George Eliot's novels or Carl Dennis's poetry.
  Negative
Hector, as  played by the very talented Simon Pegg, is a man so shallow he has never  asked himself any personal questions involving any depth whatsoever.
  Negative
That's quite a feat for a man pushing .
  Positive
"Hector and the Search for  Happiness" is extremely forgiving of its lead character, treating his  quest romantically.
  Positive
There are a couple of moments when other characters  point out Hector's faults one fight scene with his ex-girlfriend,  played by Toni Colette, puts it extremely plainly, but those moments  end up calling into question the point of the entire film.
  Negative
While  understanding that "Hector and the Search for Happiness" is meant to be a  parable, and not realistic, it uses the most condescending  fortune-cookie thinking possible, not to mention calling in entire  foreign nations to act as props to highlight one man's quest for  enlightenment.
  Negative
On his flight to China, Hector meets Edward, a wealthy businessman   Stellan Skarsgrd, who ends up showing Hector around Shanghai.
  Negative
There  are montages of the two of them wandering the streets, eating "weird"  food and pointing at the sights' Hector agog at the "exotic" setting.
  Negative
At a  nightclub, he meets a sexy woman named Ying Li Ming Zhao.
  Positive
We get  voluptuous, lingering shots of her naked back in the shower, and then a  view of her fully naked body curled up in bed, as a fully clothed Hector  stares down at her with tenderness.
  Very negative
Bedding sexy natives is one of the  perks of international travel.
  Positive
She is the only person he meets in China,  and she is an amalgamation of unimaginative stereotypes.
  Negative
She is sexy,  and also sweet, and kind of a damsel in distress, too, and she's also  really just a good girl inside!
  Very positive
It doesn't help that some of her moments  are accompanied by the sound of a Chinese gong.
  Negative
Hector meets smiling Tibetan monks who have faced terrible persecution  and torture, and yet still, they laugh, circling rapturously underneath  fluttering colored prayer flags, all as Hector watches in amazement,  inspired.
  Negative
That is why Tibet is there, apparently: to inspire the rest of  us.
  Negative
Africa is a continent, not a country, and yet "Hector and the Search for  Happiness" treats the entire gigantic land-mass, made up of multiple  and diverse countries, as one place: Africa.
  Negative
The airplanes in Africa  are filled with breastfeeding women wearing colorful robes, men smoking  cigars, and chickens wandering the aisles.
  Positive
The plane nearly crashes and  everyone laughs uproariously.
  Negative
Hector is inspired by their careless joie  de vivre!
  Neutral
He meets a woman on the plane who tells him the secret to  happiness is in her recipe for sweet potato stew and she invites him  over for dinner.
  Positive
The entire village in the unnamed African country turns  out to greet Hector joyously, whooping it up supportively as he drinks  wine and dances with them.
  Negative
These people have nothing better to do with  their lives than try to teach some dumb white guy that it's fun to have a  dinner party and hang out with your friends.
  Negative
The African sequence is a  particular low-point.
  Positive
Africa is shown as dangerous, gunfire in the  streets, and the entire "country" is boiled down into a place containing  elephants, antelopes, saintly white aid workers, women with baskets on  their heads, happy villagers and scary rifle-carrying soldiers.
  Negative
As beautifully filmed as the worldwide tour often is the film was shot  by Kolja Brandt, "Hector and the Search for Happiness" has an  undeniable strain of poverty tourism, mixed with the insulting belief  that those who have nothing somehow hold the secret to life.
  Negative
"Hector and the Search for Happiness" ends up,  unintentionally, being a treatise on the cluelessness of affluent  do-gooders, those who look at a smiling poverty-struck woman in a  refugee camp and see her as evidence that the world is good because she  is still able to smile!
  Negative
Sure, money isn't  everything, but it certainly isn't nothing either.
  Negative
Hector couldn't trek around for months on end without it.
  Negative
The supporting cast features such heavy-hitters as  Jean Reno, as a  Colombian drug dealer Hector meets in Africa, and  Christopher Plummer as  a brilliant and eccentric he wears a pink sweatshirt during lectures  neuro-scientist devoted to studying happiness.
  Negative
Toni Collette's character  Agnes seems openly irritated with Hector's quest, and by that point in  the film, many audience members will feel the same way.
  Negative
Hector is a  cipher, a nonentity, a man with no inner life, until  smiling Tibetan  monks show him their prayer flags and something clicks for him.
  Negative
Pegg, a  diverse and sensitive actor, is fine, but here he's in the service of  extremely poor material.
  Negative
Good intentions are all over "Hector and the Search for Happiness."
  Neutral
Clear care has been put into the project.
  Negative
There is nothing wrong with  trying to put on film a parable about what it means to be human' stories  about unhappy trapped characters who discover a way to cherish the life  that they have.
  Negative
Films like "Wizard of Oz," " It's a Wonderful Life" and  " Stranger Than Fiction," to name just a few, treat this same topic with  sensitivity, creativity, and emotional honesty.
  Positive
"Hector" is an animated  Power Point presentation in comparison.
  Positive
