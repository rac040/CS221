Early on in "Rat Film," Edmund, the philosophical rat exterminator, exclaims: "There ain't never been a rat problem in Baltimore.
  Negative
There's a people problem."
  Negative
Unpacking what Edmund means by that is part of the goal of Theo Anthony's eccentric feature-length debut, a patchwork quilt of influences civic, social, racial showing the historical striations that lead to what appears to be a fairly epic "rat problem."
  Negative
"Rat Film" is an odd and captivating experience, and its fluid style is its most distinguishing characteristic.
  Very positive
Moving through multiple moods and atmospheres, accompanied by an atonal and skittery score by Dan Deacon, "Rat Film" stays in the "micro" level the history of the rodent population of one particular area, but its meditative atmosphere encourages "macro" thinking as does Edmund, the exterminator.
  Negative
Anthony, a Baltimore native, knows the territory well, and approaches his topic with the spirit of an investigator and historian.

They live among us.

"Rat Film" is filled with information but Anthony uses a variety of styles to enter multiple worlds.
  Neutral
The Edmund sections are played straight, a camera on Edmund as he makes his rounds, pontificating.
  Neutral
Edmund is a good guide.
  Positive
But there are other more sections, accompanied by a whispery almost-robotic female voiceover, filling in the blanks in the narrative.
  Negative
There are sequences on the layout of Baltimore, outlining the various ordinances regarding neighborhood borders, borders that enforced segregation one particular ordinance was struck down eventually by the Supreme Court, but still practiced unofficially by landlords.
  Negative
To this day, the map of Baltimore is a "map frozen," in the memorable words in the voiceover.

  Neutral
What will draw them out?

What will kill them?
  Neutral
Anthony walks us through many of the fascinating studies.
  Neutral
The memory of those color-coded maps of segregation haunt these sequences deliberately because the problem goes deeper than the rats themselves as Edmund himself observed.
  Negative
What about improving conditions in the slums?
  Neutral
What about making sure everyone has access to clean water and prompt garbage pickup?
  Negative
These civic questions loom through the film, mainly because they go unanswered.
  Positive
It's as though everyone is working on the symptoms of the problem and not the source.
  Neutral
Anthony also seeks out contemporary figures, all of whom are rat obsessives.
  Neutral
"Rat Film" makes it seem like Baltimore has one thing on its mind at all times.

  Negative
There are the people who breed rats in order to feed their snakes.
  Negative
There's one guy who keeps an arsenal at the ready to kill the rats in his tiny backyard.
  Neutral
He's shown skulking around the back alley like a wannabe SWAT commando, stalking his hidden enemy.
  Negative
The most memorable is a dynamic duo who spend their nights "rat-fishing," placing themselves at the head of alleys with fishing poles and specially-prepared bait, designed to draw the rats out, rats seen scurrying back and forth in a swarm down the alley.
  Negative
Baltimore, in these sequences, looks like a glamorous wasteland, with empty buildings, thick shadows, streets strewn with trash, the two men standing guard, fragile bulwarks against a pandemic problem.
  Very negative
Anthony follows his obsessions.
  Neutral
There are sequences that don't address the rats specifically but dig into the everyday texture of Baltimore itself, its street layout, buildings, trees.
  Negative
The creation of a video game, taking place in the streets of Baltimore, using -D photography overlaying drawings, moves "Rat Film" into the surreal, an imaginative intermediary space where Baltimore still exists, yet in a form slightly skewed from reality.
  Positive
One of the most fascinating sections has very little to do with rats, but deepens the eccentric history of the city, its attention to detail, its pioneering spirit, its willingness to grapple with evil and the dark forces that stalk the streets, human or rodent.
  Positive
Mrs. Frances Glessner Lee, a home-schooled socialite from Chicago, created a series of exquisitely detailed dioramas in the s and s, showing horrific crime scenes.

  Negative
These dioramas are still used as training tools for law enforcement officers.
  Negative
Her  "Nutshell Studies of Unexplained Death" were donated to the Maryland Medical Examiner's office, and a criminal investigator and historian provides us with a tour.
  Negative
You can feel how drawn Anthony is to this material, to these mini-worlds splattered with fake blood.
  Negative
An entire film could be made about Mrs. Lee and the enduring fascination of her work.
  Positive
What this has to do with rats is not particularly clear.
  Negative
Its a tangent, but such a tantalizing tangent it almost takes over the rest of the films purpose.
  Negative
In George Orwell's , O'Brien says to the beleaguered and frightened Winston Smith during interrogation: "You asked me once what was in Room .

  Very negative
Winston Smith is not alone.
  Negative
To many, throughout history, the "worst thing in the world" are rats.
  Very negative
There are other ancient human phobias - snakes, arachnids - creatures who may be beautiful and useful but are harmful to humans.

Humans learn to stay away.
  Neutral
If you, like Winston Smith, have a rodent phobia, "Rat Film" will be very challenging.
  Positive
Humans have been declaring war on the rat for millennia.
  Negative
The waves of plague that decimated Europe in the Middle Ages were thought at the time to come from foul air, a miasma of poison, but, no, it was because of the rats or the fleas that live on rats.
