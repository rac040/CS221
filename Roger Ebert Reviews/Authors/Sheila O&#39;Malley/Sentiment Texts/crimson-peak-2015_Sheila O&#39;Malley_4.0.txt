  Negative
Shelley recalled that she bolted awake, thinking, "I have found it!
  Positive
What terrified me will terrify others' and I need only describe the spectre which had haunted my midnight pillow.
  Negative
Director Guillermo del Toro has a similar belief that the images crowding his brain can come to life.
  Negative
He creates intricate worlds, overwhelming viewers with detail and drowning them with symbolism.
  Positive
The fact that most of what is onscreen is physical, rather than computer-generated, helps.
  Positive
"Crimson Peak's" atmosphere crackles with sexual passion and dark secrets.
  Positive
There are a couple of monsters supernatural and human, but the gigantic emotions are the most terrifying thing onscreen.
  Neutral
Del Toro's films can  take Grand Opera emotion.
  Neutral
In Victorian-era England, the Lyceum Theatre awed audiences with revolutionary stage effects designed to bring the horror of " Macbeth" for example to the audience in visceral new ways.
  Negative
Del Toro's style would have fit in with that.
  Neutral
He has placed himself in a long tradition and he deserves to be there.
  Positive
American heiress Edith Cushing  Mia Wasikowska, the heroine of "Crimson Peak," saw the ghost of her dead mother when she was a child, the shadow of its long fingers creeping along the wall a steal from " Nosferatu".
  Negative
As a young woman, living with her supportive father a wonderful  Jim Beaver, she prefers books to beaus, and is busy writing a ghost story "Ghosts are a metaphor for the past," she states.
  Negative
When silly women sneer, " Jane Austen died a spinster," Edith replies coolly, "I'd rather be Mary Shelley and die a widow."
  Very negative
Edith's bookish isolation vanishes when the mysterious British brother and sister Thomas and Lucille Sharp  Tom Hiddleston and  Jessica Chastain arrive in town.
  Negative
The two have fancy English titles, but are penniless, begging for financial backing for one of Thomas' inventions.
  Negative
Thomas pursues Edith with burning sensitive eyes, all under his sister's watchful glare, and Edith falls hard.
  Negative
An optometrist named Alan McMichael  Charlie Hunnam, who was so sensitive and heroic in Del Toro's " Pacific Rim" is also interested in Edith, but cedes ground to Thomas, albeit with misgivings.
  Negative
Thomas marries Edith, and he, Edith and Lucille go back to England to the family estate, Allerdale Hall.
  Negative
Allerdale Hall is when the movie really begins, but those preliminary sections, the immersion into Edith's world, are equally important.
  Positive
America is shown as a land of garden parties, flickering gas lamps, intellectual pursuits, family life.
  Negative
The colors are autumnal, mustards and oranges.
  Negative
Lucille slashes through that mellow golden landscape in fiery-crimson dresses or heavy all-black gowns.
  Negative
It's often raining, creating underwater-wavery shadows on the walls.
  Negative
But it's a civilized world with recognized rules.
  Negative
Allerdale Hall, on the other hand, is a black turreted ruin of a mansion standing in the middle of empty fields.
  Negative
Red clay oozes up through the rotting floorboards, coating the walls of the basement.
  Negative
The hall inside the main entrance reaches up three stories, and because of the roof's deterioration the hall is always filled with outside weather: falling leaves or snow.
  Positive
Allerdale Hall is a masterpiece of design  Thomas E. Sanders was the production designer but also of conception.
  Very positive
The house creaks, moans, shifts.
  Negative
And always, always that red clay, threatening to engulf them all.
  Negative
Edith, at sea in her new life and intimidated by Lucille, explores the house by the end of the film the layout is clear, essential to the suspense of the finale.
  Positive
She is informed by both Thomas and Lucille that there are rooms she must not go into.
  Neutral
Edith is surrounded by secrets, with a husband she barely knows and a sister-in-law gliding through the house with a heavy key chain rattling at her waist.
  Negative
"Crimson Peak" is reminiscent of Hitchcock's "Notorious" in more ways than one although "Rebecca" is also a clear influence.
  Positive
In "Notorious," Alicia Huberman  Ingrid Bergman marries Alexander Sebastian  Claude Rains as a cover for her attempt to infiltrate a Nazi cartel.
  Negative
Once in the house, she is dominated by Alexander's mother Leopoldine Konstantin, a monstrous Fraulein from hell.
  Negative
Both "Crimson Peak" and "Notorious" feature ongoing visual motifs of tea cups and key-chains.
  Negative
There are shots in "Crimson Peak" that mirror "Notorious," a close-up of the ubiquitous key-chain with the key desired lying on the top of the heap, or the camera following a tea cup as it is carried across the room.
  Negative
Like Alicia Huberman in "Notorious," Edith feels if she could just get a hold of that key, and find the right lock, she might understand the secrets buried in that house, and her own destiny.
  Negative
As in " Pan's Labyrinth," "Crimson Peak" creates an environment where these high stakes can operate at full throttle.
  Negative
The visuals of Allerdale Hall call to mind German Expressionist filmmakers, as well as directors as various as  Mario Bava and Hitchcock.
  Negative
But while "Crimson Peak" launches associations GothicRomantic tradition, Hitchcock,  Shirley Jackson, Murnau, Bava, Kubrick's " The Shining," The Brothers Grimm, "Jane Eyre", it's not just a tribute, it's a hybrid all Del Toro's own.
  Negative
The images themselves have tremendous power: A blonde woman sneaking through a dark house holding a candelabra.
  Positive
A black-haired woman stalking through an interior snowfall, carrying a tray of rattling tea cups.
  Negative
A man in his workshop creating toys that open their mouths to vomit silver balls.
  Neutral
Edith sees horrors at night through doorways, down hallways.
  Negative
She must be brave enough to face these phantasms, to look them in the eye, to see what she is not supposed to see.
  Positive
On the opposite side, Thomas and Lucille must prevent Edith from seeing.
  Negative
Del Toro uses a lot of old-fashioned camera tricks like wipes as transitions from scene to scene, and there are also multiple iris wipes where a circular shape surrounded by blackness homes in on one small image.
  Negative
Del Toro is old-school in his framing and camera moves, in his understanding of spatial relationships.
  Neutral
There are times when Edith hugs Thomas, his black coat taking up half the screen, and as the camera moves to the side Edith is slowly engulfed by blackness.
  Negative
The final act features a couple of monologues, as secrets pour out, and some audience members may find them too expository.
  Negative
But again, in the long tradition of cinema, suspenseful films often featured such final-act monologues.
  Negative
There is strong precedent for the effectiveness of these devices, and they're effective here too.
  Positive
Kitchen-sink realism is a recent phenomenon, and Del Toro's films are not bound by those requirements, although the emotions in his films are always real.
  Negative
As actors from before the advent of cinema and the closeup understood, acting needed to be big enough to fill a theatre.
  Negative
This did not necessarily mean hollow declaiming.
  Negative
It meant that their emotions had to be big enough to travel, to reach the cheap seats, to fit the scope of the story.
  Negative
The cast of "Crimson Peak" understands that.
  Neutral
They're all gripping.
  Positive
Watching Del Toro's films is a pleasure because his vision is evident in every frame.Best of all, though, is his belief that "what terrifies him will terrify others."
  Positive
He's right.
  Positive
