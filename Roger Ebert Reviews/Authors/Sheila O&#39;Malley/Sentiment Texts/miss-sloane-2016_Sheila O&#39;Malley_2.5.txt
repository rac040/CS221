Legend has it that the term "lobbyist" originated during the presidency of Ulysses S. Grant, who referred to the petitioners bombarding him with requests for support as "lobbyists" because they always ambushed him while he was trying to relax with a brandy in the lobby of the Willard Hotel in Washington.
  Negative
The DC Mythbusting Series  has debunked that story, finding the term in use as far back as the s always with the same wheeler-dealer connotation.
  Negative
Whatever the case may be, "lobbyists" are still with us, and who or what they represent is often cloaked in mystery, making them potent fodder for conspiracy theorists and paranoid political thrillers.
  Positive
One particular lobbyist a ferocious take-no-prisoners individual named Elizabeth Sloane, played by Academy Award nominee  Jessica Chastain is the center of John Madden's "Miss Sloane."
  Negative
With a script by first-timer and it shows  Jonathan Perera, "Miss Sloane" charts the course of a woman who works for a conservative lobbying firm, but jumps ship after being asked by her scowling-eyebrow-ed boss  Sam Waterston to support the powerful gun lobby in their opposition to a new gun law featuring regulatory checks on the purchase of firearms.
  Negative
Sloane takes her entire team with her, sans one her devoted assistant Jane  Alison Pill  who decides to stay behind to a rag-tag low-rent lobbying outfit headed up by Rodolfo Schmidt  Mark Strong, devoted to pushing through that controversial gun bill.
  Negative
To say Miss Sloane is a ruthless lobbyist does not even begin to cover it.
  Negative
She is the Keyser Sze of lobbyists.
  Neutral
She is the Bobby Fischer of lobbyists, going up against grade-schoolers playing checkers.
  Negative
She is every mastermind serial killer on "Criminal Minds,"psychopaths with the wherewithal to pepper their crime scenes with  red herrings, baffling organizations following the blood trail.
  Negative
While there is a satisfaction in the spectacle of a Lone Wolf outsmarting the fat cats in Washington, and while the character of Miss Sloane is given fascinating and bizarre depths unexplained for the most part, a welcome change, "Miss Sloane" plays like a naive fantasy perhaps its release date has something to do with that.
  Neutral
Miss Sloane's political convictions are unknown.
  Neutral
She is not an idealist or an activist.
  Neutral
She does not have any convictions outside of winning a philosophy she verbalizes multiple times throughout, including in the direct-address opening scene.
  Negative
She will do anything anything to win.
  Positive
Her colleagues are thrown under the bus, used, lied to, betrayed.
  Negative
This aspect of the story is refreshing, making "Miss Sloane" more of a character study than anything else.
  Positive
It is the character study aspect of the film that is most interesting.
  Very positive
Her personal life is nonexistent.
  Negative
She pops pills in secret, presumably speed since she never sleeps.
  Negative
She is awkward in everyday human interaction.
  Neutral
Her friendship with underling Esme Manucharian an excellent  Gugu Mbatha-Raw has a disturbing power-imbalance from the start.
  Positive
There are many shots too many of people turning to one another with expressions of, "Is this lady for real?"
  Negative
We get the point: she's outside-of-the-box, she's brilliant, she's scary.
  Positive
At one point, Schmidt who poached her from her old firm asks her point-blank: "Were you ever normal?
  Neutral
What were you like as a child?"
  Neutral
The action switches back and forth between Senate hearings investigating Miss Sloane's unorthodox and perhaps illegal dealings and the events that led her to that point.
  Neutral
Perera's  awkward script makes it abundantly clear just how difficult it is to pull off Aaron Sorkin-esque dialogue, the rat-a-tat-tat of "The West Wing" or " The Social Network," featuring people wholly fluent in complex "insider" language.
  Negative
It's challenging to write and it's challenging for actors to deliver.
  Negative
The dialogue in "Miss Sloane" is stilted in the extreme "My bank account and liberal conscience won't justify owning a car", in particular in the group scenes, where the "banter" never lifts off the page.
  Negative
Chastain is a naturally emotional actress: in her nearly-wordless performance in " The Tree of Life" she is so alive onscreen you can practically see the pulse beating in her wrists.
  Very positive
Miss Sloane is not that kind of character.
  Negative
Chastain is a pleasure to look at, in her dizzyingly high heels, ice-white skin and bright red lips.
  Positive
Madden and cinematographer  Sebastian Blenkov fresh off of "Men amp' Chicken" do right by their star, lighting her and framing her in the most dramatic way possible, reveling in her coloring, her striking silhouette, getting as close as possible to her to examine the flashes of expression in this strange character's eyes.
  Positive
But shewears the character of Miss Sloane like a costume.
  Neutral
There's a flatline quality to Chastain's voice in this role not heard in her other performances that makes the dialogue sound even more over-written' theres no range, no prosody.
  Negative
When "Miss Sloane" really works is in the scenes when Miss Sloane is by herself not coincidentally, the scenes with very little dialogue.
  Negative
The relationship between Miss Sloane and Esme is fascinating: the repeat scenes where they suss each other out and form a wary bond are filled with dramatic tension.
  Positive
Jake Lacy, who continues to surprise with his diversity of character roles, is riveting as the only character who treats Miss Sloane like a human being and in a beautiful irony one of the only characters in the entire film with a moral compass.
  Positive
Their scenes together are extremely well-played and well-written, pointing out the deficiencies of the script elsewhere.
  Positive
The biggest problem is not the film's fault.
  Negative
Opening as it does two weeks after the ugliest election in U.S. history although the election of  would give it and any other a run for its money in that regard, "Miss Sloane" feels almost quaint now, even with its ends-justify-the-means cynicism, even with its vision of life on The Hill as a ruthless battle to win at all costs.
  Negative
The film is not so much tone-deaf as old-fashioned, emerging from a more innocent time say, three weeks ago when "politics as usual" actually had some meaning.
  Negative
