years ago, Lois Lowry's dystopian YA novel "The Giver" won the Newberry  Medal.
  Positive
Creepy and prophetic, told in a kind of flat-affect voice, it  has been a staple in middle-school literature curriculum ever since,  introducing young students to sophisticated ethical and moral concepts  that will help them recognize its precedents when they come to read the  works of  George Orwell or Aldous Huxley.
  Negative
Jeff Bridges has been attached  as a producer to the film project for almost  years, and finally, "The  Giver" is here, with Bridges in the title role.
  Negative
Directed by Phillip  Noyce, with an adaptation of the book by  Michael Mitnick, "The Giver"  gives us the overall structure of Lowry's original work, adds a couple  of understandable details like a sweet little romance and then derails  into an action movie in its final sequence, complete with attacks from  the air and a hi-tech command center.
  Positive
Children have been thrilled by  the book for  years, and a chase scene still proved irresistible.
  Positive
Despite a truly pained performance from Jeff Bridges and a beautifully imagined, three-dimensional futuristic world, "The Giver,"  in wanting to connect itself to more recent YA franchises, sacrifices  subtlety, inference and power.
  Negative
"The Giver" takes place in a community at some point in the  indeterminate future where "Sameness" is prized above all else.
  Positive
Multiple factors have gone into creating a  monochromatic world literally, colors have been erased where  individuality is crushed, a citizen's every move is monitored from the  moment of birth, natural families have been replaced by artificial  "family units" and choice has vanished.
  Very negative
A soothing voice  makes passive-aggressive scolding announcements over loudspeakers.
  Negative
The  Giver's cavernous dwelling, perched on the edge of a cliff, is a gloomy  and masterful set, overlooking the clouds gathered below, making The  Giver appear like Citizen Kane, holed up in his mansion surrounded by  accumulated possessions and raw pain.
  Negative
"Precision of language" is  enforced, and so people are constantly apologizing and saying "I accept  your apology" to each other, but in a rote way that drains the language  of meaning.
  Negative
"The Giver" is a cautionary tale about what happens when  language is controlled and limited ground well covered for all time in  "" where citizens have no language available to them outside of  "newsspeak."
  Negative
Memories are gone, too, in "The Giver".
  Negative
One person in the  Community is chosen to be "The Receiver" of a collective memory,  memories of now-extinct experiences like love and war and sex and pain.
  Negative
Through the course of the film, the young Jonas  Brenton Thwaites,  chosen to be the next Receiver, is introduced to complexity and emotion  and his entire concept of the world as he knows it shatters.
  Negative
He must  now make a choice: to stay or to flee.
  Negative
It's a powerful set-up, made even  more stark by Noyce's choice to film the majority of the film in  black-and-white.
  Positive
When Jonas starts to see colors again, there are  unavoidable " Pleasantville" connections.
  Negative
Jonas is raised in a family unit, with  Katie Holmes and Alexander  Skarsgrd acting as parental units.
  Negative
He has two best friends, Fiona   Odeya Rush and Asher  Cameron Monaghan, and they are about to  "graduate from childhood," and take on their assigned jobs in the  community.
  Positive
There is a gigantic ceremony, led by the Chief Elder Meryl  Streep, who shows up as a holograph the size of a building, and each  child is called to the stage to receive their assignments.
  Very negative
The entire  community gathers in a massive stadium, everyone dressed in identical  white, so it looks like a gigantic celestial choir or a formal-dress  LGAT workshop.
  Negative
Everyone speaks in unison.
  Positive
Everyone claps the same way.
  Negative
Everyone looks forward.
  Neutral
No one moves.
  Neutral
The effect is eerie.
  Neutral
Jonas is surprised when he is not assigned a job at all.
  Neutral
He is, instead,  "selected" to be the next Receiver, because he apparently has the  ability to "see beyond."
  Negative
He has no idea what that means.
  Negative
Jeff Bridges,  who becomes The Giver once a new Receiver is chosen, sits in the front  row of the stadium, grim and remote.
  Negative
The thousands of people present  start to chant in a repetitive whisper, "Jonas  Jonas  Jonas " The training sessions, when they come, are part Mr. Miyagi, part vision  quest, and part "Quantum Leap."
  Negative
The Giver bombards Jonas with memories  from all of humanity, memories that thrust Jonas into the thick of the  action: he feels snow falling for the first time, he is shown the full  spectrum of colors, he is given shaky-cam experiences of war, he also  dances around a Maypole with a saucy wench while wearing a pirate shirt.
  Very negative
There are multiple quick-shot montage sequences of smiling babies,  praying Muslims, crashing waves, paper lanterns, crying elderly people.
  Negative
The music swells, pushing the emotions on us, but the montages have the  opposite effect intended.
  Positive
Instead of revelatory glimpses of the rich  tapestry of human experience, they seem like Hallmark-collages uploaded  on YouTube.
  Negative
Noyce has also made the questionable choice to co-opt  real-world events, and so suddenly we see Tieneman Square in the  montage, or the Arab Spring, or Nelson Mandela.
  Negative
It's cheap, hoping to  ride the coattails of others, as opposed to finding a visual form and  style that will actually express the strength of the human spirit.
  Positive
Jonas begins to look around him with new eyes.
  Neutral
He wants to kiss Fiona.
  Positive
He wants to have the choice to feel things that may be unpleasant.
  Negative
He is  not allowed to share his training with others.
  Negative
The young actors in the film are pretty nondescript, the lead included,  although Thwaites seems to come alive in mischievous ways when he starts  to take care of a fussy newborn who can't stop crying at night.
  Neutral
Holmes  and Skarsgrd are both strange and unplaceable, playing human beings  whose emotions are entirely truncated.
  Negative
"Precision of language, please,"  says Mother at the dinner table when one of her children starts to  speak.
  Negative
Bridges galumphs across the screen, a madman out of Melville,  tormented, lonely, in and out of reality.
  Negative
His memories sometimes flatten  him.
  Neutral
There is one moment where he tells Jonas what the word is for the  "feeling between people," and his eyes burn with pain and loss as he  says, "Love.
  Negative
It's called love."
  Neutral
It's the only powerful moment in the  film.
  Neutral
His emotion is so palpable it reaches off the screen and grips  your throat.
  Positive
The use of heavy explanatory voiceover to open and close the film is  disappointing, especially since a couple of lines have been added to the  famous last paragraph of the book.
  Negative
Not surprisingly, the lines added  remove it from the moody ambiguous statement of hope that it is in the  book, and turn it into a complete platitude.
  Negative
We've heard it a hundred  times before.
  Negative
It emanates Sameness with every word.
  Neutral
