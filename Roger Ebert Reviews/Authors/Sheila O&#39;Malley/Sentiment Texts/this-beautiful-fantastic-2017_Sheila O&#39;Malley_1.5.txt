Bella Brown "Downton Abbey'"s  Jessica Brown Findlay, the central character of writerdirector Simon Aboud's "This Beautiful Fantastic," began life as a foundling, left in a box by a river as a baby, hovered over by protective ducks.
  Negative
Raised by nuns, Bella grows up to be a librarian, who harbors dreams of writing a children's book.
  Negative
She also has what appears to be OCD tendencies, but it's twee-movie OCD, an adorable character quirk more than anything else.
  Negative
She's a neat-nik.
  Positive
She is picky about what she eats.
  Positive
Her kitchen cabinets are organized with "Sleeping With the Enemy" precision.
  Negative
However, her organizational skills fail her in a couple of areas.
  Neutral
She is constantly late to her job at the library, and she has also let the garden behind her rented house fall to ruin.
  Positive
In another movie, this all would seem stressful and dark, but "This Beautiful Fantastic" is not meant to be realistic.
  Negative
It's supposed to be a fairy tale.
  Neutral
That's fine, but it's a very low-stakes fairy tale, wrapped in a strained garden metaphor.
  Positive
"This Beautiful Fantastic" has a very small cast, and each male character circles around Bella, wanting only to help her, be near her.
  Positive
Some of these men appear to have nothing else to do in their lives but look out for her, get her out of scrapes, teach her how to live, blossom, grow.
  Negative
The film takes place in a somewhat period-less atmosphere, so it's unclear why she dresses like she's a suffragette in , or a governess in the Edwardian era.
  Negative
Just another one of Bella's quirks, I guess.
  Negative
Her next-door neighbor Alfie  Tom Wilkinson is an ogre, a semi-terrifying Scrooge, growling at her from over the fence.
  Negative
He's the one who calls the authorities to report the jungle of weeds that is her backyard.
  Positive
Bella is given a month to turn that jungle into a proper garden or she will be thrown out into the streets.
  Negative
Alfie's personal cook, a charming Irishman named Vernon  Andrew Scott, jumps ship from the mean old man to cook for Bella, even though she has no money to pay him.
  Negative
He's a father of two.
  Neutral
Why would he give up a paying job for a non-paying one?
  Negative
You're not supposed to ask questions like this, but they were unavoidable.
  Neutral
Vernon wanders around, carrying serving trays of food, giving Bella pep talks.
  Negative
He commandeers her kitchen.
  Positive
Bella is constantly being over-ridden by everyone she meets, told what to do, where to go, who to be.
  Neutral
She doesn't appear to mind.
  Negative
At the library, Bella is drawn to a patron, a befuddled and adorable inventor named Billy  Jeremy Irvine.
  Negative
They bond over books, he shows her a mechanical bird he created.
  Neutral
Bella says of him later, "He invents mechanical animals and he makes me feel like I can fly."
  Positive
This kind of thing was done more effectively in " Amelie" the film's clearest influence, or " Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," another love story taking place in a timeless technology-less universe.
  Negative
The adorable heroine who inspires everyone she meets to do better, be better, who inspires a feeling of love and protectiveness in even crotchety old men, is as old as the hills although usually it's a child like Anne Shirley, or Shirley Temple who melts the hearts of entire communities, not a grown woman.
  Positive
Bella, except for her attention-getting outfits, doesn't register as that kind of character at all.
  Negative
Yes, she piles her peas into the corner of her plate, she needs a lot of help to do everything garden, cook, get to work on time, she checks the lock  times before she leaves the house, but that doesn't make her seem remotely like a real person.
  Negative
It's also hard to picture her writing anything that would be of interest to anyone.
  Negative
The threatened eviction is an obvious device used to heighten the time crunch, and the garden metaphor wears out its welcome almost immediately.
  Negative
Fairy tales don't need to be realistic.
  Negative
There is charm and humor in all of the performances.
  Positive
But if you keep thinking, as I did, "Wait, doesn't Vernon have two daughters he needs to support?
  Negative
How is he making a living?"
  Neutral
or "Can't she just hire a gardener for two days to hack the weeds away?"
  Negative
or "Why is everyone in this film devoting their whole lives to making Bella blossom like those seeds she plants?"
  Negative
then clearly something is not working.
  Negative
