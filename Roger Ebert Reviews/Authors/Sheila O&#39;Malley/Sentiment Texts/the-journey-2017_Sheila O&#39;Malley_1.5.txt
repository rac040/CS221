In , two years before the St. Andrews Agreement, I visited a friend in Belfast.
  Negative
Changes were already apparent, if you knew what to look for.
  Negative
A Starbucks had opened, an encouraging sign that corporations were no longer shying away from a war zone.
  Positive
There were still echoes everywhere of the decades-long strife that had shattered the community.
  Negative
I took a "black cab tour," and the guide pointed out a pub where a bomb had gone off in the past, adding, almost casually, "My girlfriend's Da got his leg blown off there."
  Negative
It was such a clear example of the multi-generational aspect to The Troubles, to any civil war really, how grief and loss are passed down.
  Negative
When Martin McGuinness died this past March, the tone of the obituaries spoke to the complexity of his legacy.
  Negative
The headlines were mostly variations of: "From IRA TerroristCommander to Peacemaker."
  Neutral
Or "From Sinn Fin Leader to First Deputy Minister."
  Neutral
The comments sections seethed with arguments.
  Neutral
This was a man who started out as a kid throwing rocks at British soldiers, who ended up shaking hands with Queen Elizabeth, a surreal moment if ever there was one, as well as sharing political power with long-time rabblerouser Reverend Ian Paisley the man who heckled Pope John Paul II in  with the immortal words: I denounce you, Anti-Christ!"
  Negative
.
  Neutral
Paisley and McGuinness actually did become if not friends then allies in their roles as First Minister and deputy First Minister of the new power-sharing government, post the  St. Andrews Agreement.
  Negative
"The Journey," directed by  Nick Hamm, written by  Colin Bateman, announces at the outset, "This story imagines that journey" "that journey" being how Paisley and McGuinness decided to bury the hatchet.
  Negative
It's a weird sentence and I got tripped up on it initially.
  Positive
Since the film is filled with real-life people Gerry Adams, Tony Blair, Bertie Ahern, etc., and since it takes place at a real-life event the St. Andrews peace talks, veering off into a pretend-universe where Paisley and McGuinness are trapped together via circumstances beyond their control and HAVE to get along ... is a simplified grade-school version of political realities.
  Negative
It's " The Odd Couple" with Irish accents.
  Neutral
There's a naivete at work in the concept: If only these men could bond about football, their wives, their kids ... if only these staunch enemies could see one another as people, then maybe the Catholics and Protestants will join hands in love and harmony!
  Negative
Did Ian Paisley  Timothy Spall and Martin McGuinness  Colm Meaney, as the film shows, go on a bizarre little road trip where they were forced to listen, grow, change?
  Negative
Of course not.
  Neutral
Unfortunately for the film, the real-life version of how these two mortal enemies became so close that they were referred to in the press as "The Chuckle Brothers" is way more interesting than the "imagined" version presented in the film.
  Negative
According to the film's imagined universe, in the middle of the peace talks, Ian Paisley had to fly back to Belfast for his Golden Anniversary wedding celebration.
  Positive
Martin McGuinness insists on accompanying Paisley.
  Neutral
Tony Blair  Toby Stephens and M chief Harry Patterson the late  John Hurt are thrown into a panic.
  Negative
McGuinness and Paisley MUST have their emotional "breakthrough" during their hour-long car ride to the airport, otherwise there will never be peace in Northern Ireland.
  Positive
Their solution to this is to deck the car with hidden cameras, and provide the fake chauffeur with a Bluetooth through which they whisper suggestions to get the two scowling adversaries talking.
  Negative
Patterson, Blair, and a taciturn Gerry Adams  Ian Beattie watch the entire thing unfold over video monitors from a command post at St. Andrews, as though it's Mission Control in Houston.
  Negative
Paisley sits in outraged silence for the first portion of the drive, while McGuinness tries to make conversation.
  Negative
Then a series of phony events a detour through a forest, a run-in with a deer, a confrontation at a gas station transforms the two men, and they finally start talking.
  Negative
McGuinness and Paisley argue over familiar territory: Bloody Sunday , the Enniskillen bombing, the hunger strike.
  Negative
Their views are so diametrically opposed that they basically live in alternate realities.
  Positive
They have fights, which include cliched lines like: "You are so defensive!"
  Negative
"Alright, walk away, walk away, that's what you do!"
  Negative
The moments where McGuinness gets the icily reserved Paisley to crack a smile are sitcom-phony, at best, and it's made even more egregious by Tony Blair and Gerry Adams gasping with excitement from afar that the Emotional Healing has begun.
  Positive
In , Spall played, back-to-back, two inflammatory and despised real-life men, Holocaust denier David Irving in " Denial" and now Paisley.
  Negative
Spall did so, in both cases, without pleading for any sympathy for the characters, suggesting the striations of fragility, narrowness, and rigidity in these men's emotional makeup.
  Negative
In "Denial," he is vigorous, staunchly upright.
  Negative
In "The Journey" he is believably decrepit and frail.
  Negative
His hatred of the man in the car with him and all that that man represents is so believable that it makes his rock-hard refusal to open up to McGuinness' joking comments understandable.
  Positive
His voice is a dead ringer for Paisley's booming religious-harangue tones.
  Negative
After the doomed Anglo-Irish Agreement in , Paisley addressed a crowd of protesters in Belfast, screaming, famously, "Margaret Thatcher tells us that that the Irish Republic should have some say in our province.
  Negative
We say NEVER!
  Neutral
NEVER!
  Neutral
NEVER!
  Neutral
NEVER."
  Neutral
Paisley's gigantic voice thunders "Never" over and over again in a kind of incantatory rhetoric, and Spall does not shy away from the intimidating size of Paisley's voice.
  Negative
Meaney has a thankless role, the McGuinness of "The Journey" being the guy who has to persist in warming up Paisley, almost like a Life Coach, using his charm and humor.
  Negative
The final exchange between Paisley and McGuinness, when they shake hands, is the best, but by then it's far too late.
  Positive
The plot-manipulations and artificial events stage-managed by Mission Control back in St. Andrews all serve to diminish the peace talks, the importance of tough compromise, and the reality of what is actually required of politicians when they decide to sit down at a table such as that one.
  Negative
