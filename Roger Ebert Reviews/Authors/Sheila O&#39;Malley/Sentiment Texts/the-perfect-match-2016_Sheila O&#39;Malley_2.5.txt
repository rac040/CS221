It's hard to tell whether or not this is a deliberate choice on the part of the screenwriters or evidence of a blind spot.

It doesn't help that Cassie Ventura, a singer and model mainly, delivers her lines in a wooden monotone, with nothing behind her eyes.
  Negative
She's beautiful, and Eva's outfits are outrageous sex-bomb extravaganzas, fit for a Prince video or a Fashion Week catwalk, but there's no real character there.
