M. Night Shyamalan had his heyday almost  years ago.
  Neutral
He leapt out of the gate with such confidence he became a champion instantly.
  Negative
And then...something went awry.
  Negative
He became embarrassingly self-serious, his films drowning in pretension and strained allegories.
  Negative
His famous twists felt like a director attempting to re-create the triumph of " The Sixth Sense," where the twist of the film was so successfully withheld from audiences that people went back to see the film again and again.
  Positive
But now, here comes " The Visit," a film so purely entertaining that you almost forget how scary it is.
  Positive
With all its terror, "The Visit" is an extremely funny film.
  Positive
There are too many horror cliches to even list "gotcha" scares, dark basements, frightened children, mysterious sounds at night, no cellphone reception, but the main cliche is that it is a "found footage" film, a style already wrung dry.
  Negative
But Shyamalan injects adrenaline into it, as well as a frank admission that, yes, it is a cliche, and yes, it is absurd that one would keep filming in moments of such terror, but he uses the main strength of found footage: we are trapped by the perspective of the person holding the camera.
  Positive
Withhold visual information, lull the audience into safety, then turn the camera, and OH MY GOD WHAT IS THAT?
  Very negative
"The Visit" starts quietly, with Mom  Kathryn Hahn talking to the camera about running away from home when she was : her parents disapproved of her boyfriend.
  Positive
She had two kids with this man who recently left them all for someone new.
  Neutral
Mom has a brave demeanor, and funny, too, referring to her kids as "brats" but with mama-bear affection.
  Positive
Her parents cut ties with her, but now they have reached out from their snowy isolated farm and want to know their grandchildren.
  Neutral
Mom packs the two kids off on a train for a visit.
  Negative
Shyamalan breaks up the found footage with still shots of snowy ranks of trees, blazing sunsets, sunrise falling on a stack of logs.
  Positive
There are gigantic blood-red chapter markers: "TUESDAY MORNING", etc.
  Negative
These choices launch us into the overblown operatic horror style while commenting on it at the same time.
  Negative
It ratchets up the dread.
  Negative
Becca  Olivia DeJonge and Tyler  Ed Oxenbould want to make a film about their mother's lost childhood home, a place they know well from all of her stories.
  Negative
Becca has done her homework about film-making, and instructs her younger brother about "frames" and "mise-en-scne."
  Positive
Tyler, an appealing gregarious kid, keeps stealing the camera to film the inside of his mouth and his improvised raps.
  Positive
Becca sternly reminds him to focus.
  Neutral
The kids are happy to meet their grandparents.
  Positive
They are worried about the effect their grandparents' rejection had on their mother similar to Cole's worry about his mother's unfinished business with her own parent in "The Sixth Sense".
  Neutral
Becca uses a fairy-tale word to explain what she wants their film to do   it will be an "elixir" to bring home to Mom.
  Positive
Nana  Deanna Dunagan, at first glance, is a Grandma out of a storybook, with a grey bun, an apron, and muffins coming out of the oven every hour.
  Very negative
Pop Pop  Peter McRobbie is a taciturn farmer who reminds the kids constantly that he and Nana are "old."
  Negative
But almost immediately, things get crazy.
  Negative
What is Pop Pop doing out in the barn all the time?
  Negative
Why does Nana ask Becca to clean the oven, insisting that she crawl all the way in?
  Negative
What are those weird sounds at night from outside their bedroom door?
  Neutral
They have a couple of Skype calls with Mom, and she reassures them their grandparents are "weird" but they're also old, and old people are sometimes cranky, sometimes paranoid.
  Negative
As the weirdness intensifies, Becca and Tyler's film evolves from an origin-story documentary to a mystery-solving investigation.
  Negative
They sneak the camera into the barn, underneath the house, they place it on a cabinet in the living room overnight, hoping to get a glimpse of what happens downstairs after they go to bed.
  Negative
What they see is more than they and we bargained for.
  Positive
Dunagan and McRobbie play their roles with a melodramatic relish, entering into the fairy-tale world of the film.
  Negative
And the kids are great, funny and distinct.
  Positive
Tyler informs his sister that he wants to stop swearing so much, and instead will say the names of female pop singers.
  Negative
The joke is one that never gets old.
  Negative
He falls, and screams, "Sarah McLachlan!"
  Negative
When terrified, he whispers to himself, " Katy Perry ... " Tyler, filming his sister, asks her why she never looks in the mirror.
  Negative
"Your sweater is on backwards."
  Neutral
As he grills her, he zooms in on her, keeping her face off-center, blurry grey-trunked trees filling most of the screen.
  Positive
The blur is the mystery around them.
  Neutral
Cinematographer  Maryse Alberti creates the illusion that the film is being made by kids, but also avoids the nauseating hand-held stuff that dogs the found-footage style.
  Negative
When the twist comes, and you knew it was coming because Shyamalan is the director, it legitimately shocks.
  Positive
Maybe not as much as "The Sixth Sense" twist, but it is damn close.
  Negative
The audience I saw it with gasped and some people screamed in terror.
  Positive
There are references to " Halloween", "Psycho" Nana in a rocking chair seen from behind, and, of course, " Paranormal Activity"' the kids have seen a lot of movies, understand the tropes and try to recreate them themselves.
  Negative
"The Visit" represents Shyamalan cutting loose, lightening up, reveling in the improvisational behavior of the kids, their jokes, their bickering, their closeness.
  Negative
Horror is very close to comedy.
  Positive
Screams of terror often dissolve into hysterical laughter, and he uses that emotional dovetail, its tension and catharsis, in almost every scene.
  Positive
The film is ridiculouson so many levels, the story playing out like the most monstrous version of Hansel amp' Gretel imaginable, and in that context, "ridiculous" is the highest possible praise.
  Very negative
