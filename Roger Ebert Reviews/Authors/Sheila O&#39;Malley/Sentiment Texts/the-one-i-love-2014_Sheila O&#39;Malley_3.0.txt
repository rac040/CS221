The set-up of "The One I Love," Charlie McDowell's directorial debut,  starring  Mark Duplass and  Elizabeth Moss, is filled with tremendous  possibilities, all of which are explored throughout the film.

The  set-up, reminiscent of some of Hitchcock's films, works like a  well-oiled stopwatch: once the situation starts, it cannot be stopped.

  Positive
There's a reason "The Twilight Zone"  is referenced in Justin Lader's script.

  Positive
Not knowing the "twist" going  in was part of the film's pleasure, and it's enough to say that nothing  is what it seems.

  Negative
Cinematographer  Doug Emmett fills the screen with dark gloomy shadows,  and strange points-of-view, the two characters seen through a doorjamb  from an adjacent room, or through the windows from outside.
  Negative
These  touches give a creepy horror-movie perspective to the point of view.

On their retreat, alone in the big house, Ethan and Sophie make dinner.
  Negative

That night, they crash in the  guest house and have sex.
  Negative

  Negative

The entire film rests on the  chemistry between Duplass and Moss.
  Neutral
Except for the counselor, there are  no other people in it.

To Ethan, trying  something new means "going horseback riding with a satchel of wine."
  Negative
Ethan and Sophie are not extraordinary characters.
  Positive
But the situation in  which they find themselves in is.
