Political decisions have affected the family in extraordinarily intimate ways.
  Positive
The hope that Obama may represent is an emanation coming through clouds of pot-smoke and Gen-X cynicism.
  Negative

Their relationship is the heart of the film.
  Positive
Daryl Pittman's cinematography immerses the film in elegiac autumn, flaming autumn leaves, chilly fog, frost on the grass, bright October sunlight.
  Negative
The use of interspersed home-movie footage of Colleen and Jacob as kids is cute, showing their ghoulish childhood interest in horror and vampires and death, but it's also a cliche.
