  Neutral
Or, he was.
  Neutral

  Positive
He blames that book for  ruining his marriage.
  Negative
When "A Fantastic Fear of Everything" opens, Jack  is currently working on a project called "Decades of Death", a study of  Victorian-era serial killers, the "Golden Age of murder".
  Positive
He cannot  leave his flat in Hackney.
  Negative
He sleeps clutching a knife.
  Negative
Jack is afraid  of everything, of being murdered, of launderettes, of eyeballs, of  Christmas carolers, of the telephone ringing, and every other casual  thing that comes up in life.
  Negative
"A Fantastic Fear of Everything", directed by  Crispian Mills with  animation sequences directed by  Chris Hopewell, is a fascinating and  uneven horror-comedy, strange and ambitious, anchored by a tour de force  performance by Simon Pegg.
  Very positive
Pegg, obviously, is well-known to fans of  Edgar Wright's films, as well as his appearances in blockbuster  franchises like " Mission: Impossible" and " Star Trek", but here, he is  basically given a one-man show.
  Negative
He is in every scene, clad in filthy  underpants and an open silk robe.
  Negative
He is a phenomenal physical actor.
  Positive
Watching him work is the primary pleasure of "A Fantastic Fear of  Everything."
  Positive
Similar to "Barton Fink," another hallucinogenic story of a  writer haunted by his own unfinished projects and lost opportunities,  "A Fantastic Fear of Everything" examines the creative process as seen  through the eyes of a writer gone completely mad.
  Negative
Jack is a wreck when the film opens, and his condition deteriorates from  there.
  Negative
Fleeing from shadows in his own gloomy flat, it is hard to  believe that Jack was ever together enough to have had any success as a  writer, let alone be someone's husband.
  Negative
"A Fantastic Fear" is best when  it explores what it is like inside a paranoid mind, a man so bewildered  by the simple tasks of life "I've never bought a toilet roll!"
  Positive
he cries  in a panic to his agent that he cannot leave his house.
  Negative
The first half of the film features Jack gearing up for a lunch with his  agent deliciously played by  Clare Higgins, and then the fallout from  that meeting, where she tells him a producer from Hollywood is  interested in his "Decades of Death" project.
  Positive
All he needs to do, the  only thing, is put on a suit and meet the guy for dinner.
  Negative
But once he is  back in his flat, the hallucinations take over again, and he becomes  convinced that the Hollywood guy is somehow related to one of the grisly  Victorian murderers on his wall.
  Very negative
At any rate, the situation goes south,  and his panic is exacerbated by the fact that he does not own a suit,  his socks are filthy, and he is afraid of going to the laundromat.
  Negative
Mills  and the production design team pull out all the stops in the first  half, filming Pegg in a distorted and fantastical way, so that never  once are we outside his delusional viewpoint.
  Negative
Shadows loom around Jack  and cloaked figures seem to float at the end of the dark hallway.
  Negative
Six  innocent Christmas carolers on the stoop are filmed as though they are  portents of evil doom.
  Negative
As awful as the situation is for Jack, Pegg is so  funny and so committed to the performance that the psychotic break  becomes hugely entertaining.
  Positive
"A Fantastic Fear of Everything" goes off the rails in its second half,  when Jack ventures out to wash his socks, shirt, and underpants at a  laundromat.
  Negative
He is so frightened that the fellow customers at the  laundromat stare at him with what seems to be hostile intent.
  Negative
The  situation, which starts out humorously made even more so by the fact  that Jack has accidentally Super-glued his huge knife to his hand,  drags on so long it becomes actually interminable.
  Very negative
It is as though once  Jack leaves his flat, so rich with psychodrama horror-movie potential,  "A Fantastic Fear of Everything" doesn't know what film it wants to be  anymore.
  Negative
There are still some very funny moments, and the script is  often hilarious.
  Very positive
Only Simon Pegg could make the screamed comment "This  is a CELLAR" funnier with every repetition.
  Neutral
As the film galumphs awkwardly towards its ending, with flashes of  visual brilliance like intermittent lightning, events start to dovetail,  and there are scenes with a Freudian psychiatrist wearing an eyepatch  and a pirate's hat, and a pretty girl who shows up at the laundromat   Amara Karan, well-known for her performance as Rita, or "Sweet Lime",  in Wes Anderson's " The Darjeeling Limited", as well as an actual serial killer on the loose who just wants to be loved because  he was abandoned as a child.
  Negative
The film is too cynical to play any of this  sentimentally: the "wounded inner child" sub-plot is obviously supposed  to be snarky and ironic, and it is.
  Negative
But the film is haunted by its  superior first half.
  Negative
"A Fantastic Fear of Everything" is not, actually, fantastic, but it was  inventive enough to hold my interest, weird enough to be intriguing,  and bold in some of its visual experiments.
  Positive
At the center of it all is  Simon Pegg' terrified and manic, talking to himself, racing around in  stained Fruit of the Looms, kitchen knife glued to his hand.
  Negative
It is a  compelling and comedic portrait of creativity, obsession, and psychosis.
  Very positive
