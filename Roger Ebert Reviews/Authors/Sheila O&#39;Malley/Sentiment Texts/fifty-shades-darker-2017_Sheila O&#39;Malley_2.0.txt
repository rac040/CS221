Who would have guessed that, when he was a boy, Christian Grey, the controlling, sexually sadistic bazillionaire at the center of E.L. James " Fifty Shades of Grey" juggernaut, was a "Chronicles of Riddick" fan?
  Neutral
In a scene in "Fifty Shades Darker," the sequel to "Fifty Shades of Grey," Christian  Jamie Dornan sits in his childhood bedroom and tentatively opens up to his girlfriend Anastasia  Dakota Johnson.
  Negative
Looming behind his head on the wall is a gigantic " Riddick" poster.
  Negative
Did the set decorator put the poster there to add texture?
  Negative
Backstory?
  Neutral
Whatever the intent, having "Riddick" loom as the background image in a desperately serious, post-coital conversation was inadvertently hilarious.
  Negative
There's a lot of inadvertently hilarious stuff in "Fifty Shades Darker," directed by  James Foley and he'll be directing the final installment too, "Fifty Shades Freed, with Johnson and Dornan back as star-crossed lovers Anastasia and Christian, respectively.
  Negative
These films take themselves extremely seriously, which makes them very easy targets.
  Positive
Fifty Shades Darker starts with Christian waking up from a nightmare of the abuse he experienced as a child.
  Negative
This is the main thrust of the movie puns are unavoidable: Christians unresolved trauma from his Dickensian past and whether or not Anastasia can help him heal.
  Negative
I dont judge other peoples fantasies.
  Neutral
But what works for E.L. James as fantasy fodder makes for tiresome viewing.
  Negative
Christian and Anastasia have subtext-free conversations, where Anastasia murmurs howlers such as, So you pick women who look like your mother?
  Negative
with a straight face.
  Neutral
Hats off, Ms. Johnson.
  Negative
's Fifty Shades of Grey directed by  Sam Taylor-Johnson was a ponderous affair showing the prolonged foreplay before the actual foreplay.
  Negative
Would Anastasia sign Christians Byzantine contract of sexual consent?
  Neutral
Would she agree to anal fisting?
  Neutral
Tune in next week!
  Neutral
That film ended with a sex game gone wrong, and Anastasia realizing that Samp'M actually involved, you know, pain.
  Negative
Learning this, she fled into the night.
  Negative
Fifty Shades Darker picks up shortly after that.
  Negative
Anastasia now works as an assistant editor in a small publishing house.
  Positive
Her boss  Eric Johnson is a leering entitled predator who makes Christian look manageable by comparison.
  Positive
Side note: another assistant in the office is named Hannah and so we are treated to multiple scenes with variations of: Good night Anna.
  Positive
Good night, Hannah.
  Positive
Hannah, how are you?
  Neutral
Im fine, Anna.
  Positive
etc.
  Neutral
Was Hannah the only name available?
  Neutral
Christian wants Anastasia back.
  Neutral
Hes even willing to go vanilla if thats her preference.
  Neutral
It is, so they have vanilla sex, and everything is going great with boat rides and masked balls and makeover montages until  well, until all kinds of things, so many, many, MANY things old lovers, a shady business deal, PTSD flashbacks, an attempted sexual assault, a helicopter careening out of control intervene.
  Positive
Screenwriter  Niall Leonard had his work cut out for him adapting the book.
  Neutral
These two lovebirds cannot catch a break and vanilla cannot withstand such unbelievable pressure.
  Negative
Anastasia is drawn back into the web of Christian's desires.
  Positive
And she has fun with it, for the most part.
  Positive
Good for her.
  Positive
The thing about Dakota Johnson and its very important is that she is unable to suppress her clear intelligence and, even rarer, sense of humor.
  Negative
It's so evident that it becomes a defining characteristic, as well as an important anchor for a film that desperately needs it.
  Positive
The dialogue is so silly and so repetitive that it could sink a far more seasoned actress.
  Very negative
But she survives.
  Positive
Theres a goofiness about her, a charming awkwardness that feels organic' Foley was smart enough to realize how much Johnson's sense of humor helps the film.
  Positive
She was wonderful in Luca Guadagnino's  A Bigger Splash, one of the best films of last year, playing a manipulative little sexpot who enjoys messing with the heads of the men in thrall to her.
  Very positive
Up against some serious competition in A Bigger Splash  Ralph Fiennes,  Matthias Schoenaerts,  Tilda Swinton, she more than held her own.
  Negative
Here, she's at the center.
  Neutral
Johnson doesnt quite make Anastasia distinctive or unique, but she does come off onscreen as reactive, and impulsive.
  Positive
She is not afraid of the material and also not afraid to show how absurd she finds some of it, how absurd she finds him.
  Negative
This is no small feat.
  Negative
She's fun to watch.
  Positive
Kim Basinger shows up as Elena Lincoln, the oft-mentioned Mrs. Robinson in Fifty Shades of Grey, the older woman who initiated Christian into all the joys of bondage play, at the very same moment she was committing statutory rape.
  Negative
Basinger shows up as a Cassandra-like figure, hell-bent on warning Anastasia off.
  Negative
Bella Heathcote plays Leila, Christians sub before Anastasia, who is now out of her mind, stalking Anastasia through the streets, wearing raggedy clothes that make her look like an extra in Les Miserables.
  Negative
Marcia Gay Harden returns as Christians mother, overwhelmed with joy that her bizarre adopted son is involved with someone so normal.
  Positive
Its a weird mix.
  Neutral
Theres so much going on that the sex scenes are incidental, rather than the whole damn point.
  Negative
And thats the worst sin of all.
  Negative
There have been so many think pieces about Fifty Shades, the books and the movie, because whenever millions of women go crazy about something en masse, it becomes a National Concern.
  Negative
What does it MEAN that women respond to this?
  Neutral
Both men and women participate in the concern-trolling.
  Neutral
Why is a woman submitting to a guys misogynist demands considered sexy?
  Negative
Well, maybe because this is a fantasy, and fantasies dont make sense.
  Positive
You can have a fantasy about being abducted by pirates and have no desire in real life to be abducted by pirates.
  Negative
Both Anastasia and Christian consent to the sex they have.
  Positive
This is not to say that Christian is not a nightmare.
  Negative
He is, but not because he wants to tie her up and spank her.
  Negative
Hes a nightmare because he blows a gasket when she has to go on a business trip.
  Negative
There are so many real things to worry about in this world.
  Negative
What people get up to behind closed doors, if theyre both into it, is not one of them.
  Negative
However, when sex is presented as thisserious as opposed to a normal thing that consenting adults choose to do with one another and the kinks here aren't all that "out there" anyway, you want everyone to just admit the absurdity of it.
  Neutral
Sex can be and often is hot AND absurd.
  Negative
The  film " Secretary," also about a dom-sub relationship involving a Mr. Grey, portrayed fear, desire, humor, simultaneously.
  Positive
In other words, Secretary had its ball-gag and ate it too.
  Negative
But Fifty Shades Darker is less interested in exploring how the power plays of Samp'M have to be negotiated a rich topic, and more interested in the conventional narrative of a damaged man terrified of intimacy and a loving woman waiting for him to transform into the wonderful boyfriend that she knows is inside of him.
  Negative
Fifty Shades Darker may wear leather and chains, but its still a retro bore.
  Negative
