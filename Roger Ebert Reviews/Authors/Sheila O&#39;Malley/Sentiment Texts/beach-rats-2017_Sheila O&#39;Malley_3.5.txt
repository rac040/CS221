"Beach Rats," writerdirector Eliza Hittman's second feature, has a plot, sort of, but the plot isn't really "the thing" here.
  Negative
The film is more of a tone-poem, a shifting collage of mood and atmosphere, back-lit by the seedy-glamorous colored lights of Coney Island, the neighborhood in which the film takes place.
  Negative
Shot on mm by French cinematographer  Hlne Louvart, the film immerses you in an almost totally sensorial experience: smells, sounds, colors, the look of skin in sunlight and darkness, etc.
  Negative
Hittman's devotion to the male bodies onscreen is obsessive.
  Negative
Most good filmmakers, and most good artists, are obsessives.
  Positive
It goes with the territory.
  Positive
Hittman's obsession creates a potent blend of eroticism, pent-up feelings and good old-fashioned appreciation of beauty.

  Negative
Nobody has anywhere to go.
  Positive
Late at night, alone in his basement room, Frankie signs on to webcams to sex-chat with local men, most of them older.
  Negative
Sometimes they meet up in person, for quick sex in the shadows by the beach.
  Positive
You know without even having to be told that Frankie has not revealed and could never reveal to his tough-guy friends what he is doing, who he is.
  Negative
The word "gay" barely exists for Frankie as a possible identity.
  Negative
Dickinson hails from England, and you believe completely that he is a big jocky Brooklyn guy.
  Positive

  Negative
He's pulled, almost by a force outside his control, into dating her.

  Positive
Frankie is passive about all of this to the point where you don't know if HE knows that he has a choice.
  Negative
But still, at night, Frankie has anonymous encounters with grizzly old guys, most of whom act like they've hit the jackpot when they get their first look at his physique and his beautiful face.
  Negative
What happens in "Beach Rats" happens between the words.
  Neutral
There are some familiar trappings of this kind of story, a hookup gone wrong, worries about his homophobic friends, fights with Mom, the fear that something might really go wrong if his secret is revealed ... But "Beach Rats" works best when it's elusive, when it succumbs to its interest in bodies' filmed in fragments, forearms, cheekbones, stomachs, sculpted with shadows.
  Positive
The film is frankly voyeuristic, sometimes objectifying, but it's an appreciative objectification, reminiscent of Bruce Weber's photographs.
  Negative
The male bodies dominate.
  Negative
We are in Frankie's claustrophobic world of longing.
  Negative
Some may find the elusiveness of "Beach Rats" a cop-out.
  Negative
I didn't.
  Neutral
Yes, I wanted to tell Frankie to go find a local LGBT center and get a new tribe of more accepting friends.
  Negative
But "Beach Rats" is about longing, more than anything else, the experience of wordless inchoate longing.
  Negative
Longing is agony, but longing is pleasurable too.
  Positive
Hittman gets that.
  Neutral
