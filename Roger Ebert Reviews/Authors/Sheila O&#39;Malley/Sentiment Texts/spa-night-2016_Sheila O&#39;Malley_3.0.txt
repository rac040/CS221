"Spa Night," Andrew Ahn's debut feature as a writerdirector, developed in the Sundance Institute's Screenwriting Lab, is an intimate, deliberate exploration of the struggles of David  Joe Seo, a first-generation Korean-American, to live up to his parents' dauntingly high expectations at the same time that the sexual closet in which he lives becomes unbearably stifling.
  Negative
"Spa Night" takes too much time to portray David's achingly slow and incomplete coming-out process, but its focus on the interior maelstrom of a teenager is extremely insightful.
  Positive
David is a dutiful son and a gay kid yearning to be himself in a community where that is just not done.
  Neutral
David lives with his hard-working parents, his mother Soyoung  Haerry Kim and father Jin  Youn Ho Cho.
  Neutral
They came to America as newlyweds, settled in the vibrant "Koreatown" neighborhood in Los Angeles and set up shop with a restaurant.
  Positive
The community is filled with hard-working immigrants owning shops and karaoke bars as well as -hour spas, the center of the neighborhood's social life.
  Negative
David helps in the restaurant, goes to church with his parents, works out at home, takes daily runs and privately takes photos of his developing six-pack abs but he is far too shy to share these online.
  Negative
David has no friends and no contact at all with an "out" demographic.
  Negative
He's not a good student and apathetic about his SAT prep.
  Negative
He's uncertain about how to tell his parents that .
  Negative
college might not be for him and .
  Neutral

  Neutral
Both statements are unthinkable, and Ahn's sensitive script and eloquent framing helps provide the context necessary to show why.
  Positive
When he visits a childhood friend enrolled at USC, David is a fish out of water, baffled by the partying and uncomfortable at the rampant heterosexuality.

  Positive
In the middle of his identity crisis, his parents receive a devastating blow when they lose the restaurant.
  Neutral

  Neutral

  Positive
As he mops the floors and puts out towels, he senses all around him the pulse of illicit sexual activity.
  Negative
It's excruciating and intense.
  Negative
Ahn and his cinematographer  Ki Jin Kim film all of this in widescreen, creating a sensual mood, scenes drowned in steam or blue light.
  Negative
Confidence like Ahn's comes from confidence in the story he wants to tell.
  Positive
"Coming out" may be a rite of passage but each story is different, each person has different pressures.
  Positive
Similar to Stephen Cone's " Henry Gamble's Birthday Party," "Spa Night" is as much about the surrounding social context as it is about David's sexual awakening.
  Positive
Ahn lingers his camera's attention on body parts: chests, legs, arms and hands, a potent tease to the repressed David.
  Positive
"Spa Night" is refreshingly casual about male nudity, but David is so torn that "putting off" sexual self-expression is a way of life.
  Positive
He lives in a hothouse bell-jar of his own unspoken yearnings, stealing glances at naked men emerging from the sauna, realizing that hook-ups are happening all around him.
  Negative
Those who expect the story to unfold in the conventional way, with a hidden love affair, or sexual liaison, with his parents "finding out," may be disappointed at the film's focus on yearning, as opposed to acting.
  Negative
Haerry Kim and Youn Ho Cho as David's parents are superb, and it is astonishing that this is Cho's first credit.
  Very positive
What a performance!

David's father is emasculated by his failure to provide for his family and for David's future.

He explodes at David at one point: "We didn't move here so you could move furniture!
  Negative
Go to college!
  Neutral
Get a girlfriend!
  Neutral
Get out!"
  Neutral
"Spa Night" is as much the story of David and his parents' struggles as new immigrants, cut off from family back home, as it is about David's sexuality.
  Negative
There are a couple of drawbacks to the film's deliberate slow pace.
  Negative
David knows who he is but is trapped in the closet with no way out that he can see.
  Neutral
"Spa Night" presents the problem and offers no easy solutions.
  Negative
This is a good thing, since films are not required to offer solutions, but "Spa Night" is too static and repetitive.
  Negative
The film is admirable in presenting the issues a gay kid faces in an extremely specific environment, and for resisting a more conventional storyline.
  Positive
But there is a clouded aspect to the approach which may be appropriate to David's journey but is difficult to withstand over the course of the film.
  Negative
"Spa Night" is not " Appropriate Behavior," where a first-generation Iranian immigrant lives an entirely double life, cut off from full integration in both worlds.
  Negative
This is the story of a boy willing to put off embracing his identity until ... well, until when is not clear.
  Positive
David's apathy and passivity hold him back, hold the film back.
  Positive
Even with its flaws, "Spa Night" is an extremely personal film.
  Positive
We need more of those.
  Negative
