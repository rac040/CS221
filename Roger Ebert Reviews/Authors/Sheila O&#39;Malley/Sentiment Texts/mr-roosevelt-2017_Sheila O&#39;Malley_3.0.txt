Emily Martin  Nol Wells doesn't quite know how to explain what it is she does, or even what it is she wants to do.
  Negative
She's not exactly an actress.
  Neutral
She's not exactly a comedian either.
  Neutral
She hangs around improv clubs in Los Angeles, but feels put off by the whole "scene."
  Negative
She made one YouTube video that went viral, but she couldn't "monetize" it.
  Negative
Emily is first shown during an audition in which she transforms herself in quick succession since she only has five minutes, into  Holly Hunter at a garage sale,  Kristen Wiig coming across a murder, a Vine video of someone tripping at a Beyonce concert, and a "girl who's always cold."
  Negative
The casting director is frozen in fear at the rollicking manic display.
  Positive
Emily tromps off to her gig editing videos in some random apartment crowded with people on laptops.
  Negative
All of this occurs in the first five minutes of Wells' first feature as a writer and director, "Mr. Roosevelt."
  Neutral
Anyone who has ever circulated, even peripherally, in any comedy club scene, will recognize all of it.
  Negative
It's a quick-flash study of both frenzied activity and crushing ennui.
  Positive
Emily is a transplant to Los Angeles from Austin, Texas.
  Negative
She is unmoored.
  Positive
The "industry" has no idea what to do with someone like her.
  Negative
Shedoesn't know what to do, and her awkward self-deprecation makes others recoil from her.
  Negative
When her ex-boyfriend Eric  Nick Thune calls to let her know that her cat Mr. Roosevelt has died, Emily dissolves into tears and books the first flight back to Austin she can find.
  Negative
Wells is an established actress and writer.
  Positive
With a recurring role on "Master of None," and a brief stint on " Saturday Night Live," she also recently played Jessica Williams' best friend in " The Incredible Jessica James," and was funny support staff to the lead.
  Positive
In her first film as a writer-director, she presents a world she clearly knows well.
  Positive
From Texas originally, Wells filmed "Mr. Roosevelt" around Austin, with the clear familiarity of a local.
  Positive
Austin residents will probably pick up more of her commentary than outsiders, but it's clear what she's getting at when she shows Emily's disappointment at the closing of her favorite coffee shop.
  Negative
Austin is gentrifying.
  Positive
Wells has been very smart in creating the lead character, both in the writing, and the performing.
  Positive
She presents Emily in broad strokes at first the audition, a one-night stand with a guy who never puts down his phone even when her head is in his crotch, her free-floating ambition for a career but much of it works by stealth.
  Positive
You have to put it together as you go.
  Neutral
Wells herself is very endearing as a personality, so it takes a while to really "get" that Emily is kind of a nightmare.
  Positive
For example, she arrives in Austin with just a backpack, having made no arrangements for where she will stay.
  Negative
She clearly assumes she will stay with her ex in the house where they once lived together, even though he is involved in a brand-new relationship.
  Negative
This is a woman who does not have her act together.
  Negative
Over the course of the film, her nonexistent "act" will deteriorate even further, as she thrashes about in jealousy at her ex's perfect new girlfriend, bristles at questions about her life in Los Angeles, and ratchets up her competitive mourning for the aforementioned cat Mr. Roosevelt.
  Negative
It's not that Emily is not likable.
  Negative
It's that she's a mess.
  Negative
Being a mess is extremely human.
  Negative
Eric's new girlfriend is the kind of woman designed to make insecure women feel worse.
  Negative
She is, as Emily complains, a "Pinterest board come to life."
  Positive
Celeste, played by  Britt Lower with impenetrable calm that also manages to be very funny, is an "entrepreneur," equally handy with whipping up mimosas and whipping out a drill.
  Positive
Eric once a musician is now studying to get his real estate license.
  Neutral
Emily compliments Eric on a shirt he's wearing and he replies, "It's breathable cotton."
  Negative
He drinks oolong tea now.
  Positive
Emily is horrified.
  Negative
She doesn't even know who he is anymore.
  Negative
At a disastrous group dinner at a restaurant, Emily meets Jen the wonderful  Daniella Pineda while having a private freakout in the bathroom, and Jen matter-of-factly throws a glass of water in Emily's face to snap her out of hysteria.
  Positive
It's the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
  Positive
The premise of "Mr. Roosevelt" is pretty slight, but it's filled with funny performances and biting snippets of social commentary.
  Positive
There's a really well-done sequence the most evocative in the film where Emily hangs out with Jen and her friends at a watering hole, and they get stoned and all take their tops off "It's legal here," someone drawls and do cannon balls into the water, or tiptoe across the rocks in an awkward kick-line.
  Negative
The nudity is playful, innocent, and captures Austin its essence and vibe, a vibe Wells clearly loves.
  Positive
Emily's behavior leads her on a collision course with Celeste, with Eric, with her own life, and even with Jen, who constantly has a glass of water at the ready should Emily ratchet it up again.
  Negative
Wells has given us a personal and extremely observant story, with moments of honesty and humor.
  Very positive
She is fair to every character.
  Positive
Even Celeste ends up being multi-layered.
  Negative
Wells is a talented writer and has woven together the strands into a humorous whole.
  Very positive
The film could have been choppily episodic, or had the unfortunate structure of sketched-in "bits" unconnected to a narrative.
  Negative
Instead, it's a funny story about a funny woman who finally realizes it's time to grow up.
  Positive
It is a "win" for women in film when one of the biggest blockbusters of the year, and a "superhero comic book movie" no less, is directed by a woman.
  Very positive
Patty Jenkins, in directing " Wonder Woman," has broken through a certain glass ceiling.
  Negative
When I interviewed directorcinematographer Reed Morano in  about her first feature, " Meadowland," I asked her about the challenges faced by female directors in the industry, and she said, "Isn't it weird that this male director who has only directed a  million dollar Sundance movie is now suddenly directing a hundred-million-dollar Marvel movie, for his second film?
  Negative
And you definitely don't see happen that with women.
  Positive
There's a discrepancy there."
  Neutral
But while it's great to see women move into bigger budget film-making, it's even more important that women create their ownstories, do what they want to do.
  Positive
I would hate to see the equation Blockbuster  Success.
  Negative
The more women develop their own projects, produce their own films, make films their way, telling the stories they want to tell, the healthier the industry will be.
  Positive
Wells' "Mr. Roosevelt" is part of that.
  Neutral
