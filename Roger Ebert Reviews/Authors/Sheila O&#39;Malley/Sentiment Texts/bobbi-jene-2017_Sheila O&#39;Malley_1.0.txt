When a film doesn't work, it's often because the intention behind it is not clear.
  Negative
What does the film want to convey?
  Neutral
What is the point?
  Neutral
What's the story?
  Neutral
These are elemental but essential considerations.
  Neutral
"Bobbi Jene," Elvira Lind's documentary about  Bobbi Jene Smith, a longtime dancer in Israeli choreographer  Ohad Naharin's Batsheva Dance Group, is unclear in its intentions.
  Positive
It doesn't know what it wants to be, or what story it wants to tell.
  Negative
The film is about a dancer, but there's not all that much dance in it.
  Negative
It's about a woman making a life-changing choice, but the movie itself has a very low-stakes atmosphere.
  Neutral
Bobbi Jene Smith has had a unique life as a dancer, but her personal problems are extremely ordinary.
  Negative
Lind gets sucked into these personal matters to such a degree that they take over the film.
  Negative
"Bobbi Jene," then, is really a film about Smith's love life, the challenges of maintaining a long-distance relationship, dealing with parents who don't "get it," fears that she might never have kids, that it's "too late" for her ... While these things are meaningful to those going through them, it is not especially interesting to watch, especially when Lind's intention is to profile a dancer whose work she clearly finds provocative.
  Negative
Bobbi Jene Smith was attending Juilliard when Naharin's Batsheva Dance Group visited New York.
  Negative
After seeing one of the performances, she was so blown away she sought out Naharin to compliment him on his work.
  Negative
He invited her to join the company.
  Negative
Impulsively, she dropped out of school and moved to Israel to take him up on his offer.
  Positive
She was  years old.
  Neutral
When "Bobbi Jene" opens, Smith, now , has decided to leave Batsheva and strike out on her own.
  Negative
She wants to see who she is as a dancer outside Naharin's intense circle of influence they were also lovers at one point.
  Positive
She has lived in Israel for a decade, and makes the difficult decision to move back to the United States.
  Positive
She is in a relationship with Or, another dancer in Batsheva, but he is  years her junior, and doesn't want to leave the dance company yet.
  Negative
He tells her he wants to raise his future kids in Israel.
  Positive
They have a tearful goodbye one of many at the airport.
  Neutral
Back in the States, she works on a solo show.
  Positive
Lind doesn't dig deep enough into Smith's process as a dancer, or as a choreographer to give us an idea of what the solo show is about, what the movements are meant to express.
  Negative
What's Smith's philosophy as a dancer?
  Neutral
What's her style?
  Neutral
The few comments Smith makes are banal "I want to get to that place where I have no strength to hide anything."
  Negative
.
  Neutral
The footage we get of Smith's solo show, done completely in the nude, culminating in her grinding herself into a bag of sand, don't help.
  Positive
Lind doesn't show the dance in its totality, cutting away from the action to focus on the faces of audience members as we hear Smith grunting and moaning off-screen.
  Negative
She was barely out of her teenage years when she hitched her star to Naharin.
  Neutral
Naharin's style and dance philosophy "gaga" is known the world over, and Bobbi Jene flourished in that environment.
  Positive
What kind of work does she want to create on her own?
  Neutral
More importantly though, does she have anything to say?
  Neutral
These are fascinating concepts.
  Positive
The recent " Polina," while not a documentary, is about just that.
  Negative
Smith's solo show, done at the Israeli Museum in Jerusalem, comes off as extremely literal, with its only goal personal catharsis, or maybe just exhibitionism.
  Negative
The tearful impressed responses of audience members afterwards left me thinking, "I guess you had to be there."
  Negative
There had been some concern beforehand that her show would be controversial in the more conservative environment of Jerusalem.
  Negative
Instead, we are just shown the raves, the accolades.
  Negative
If there was any pushback, it's not included.
  Negative
Lind has instead spent most of her time on Bobbi Jene and Or's Skype-conversations, their bittersweet reunions, their struggles to maintain their relationship at such a far remove, Bobbi Jene crying about losing him, Bobbi Jene morosely folding her nephew's baby clothes, or staring longingly at diamond rings in a store window ... it's endless.
  Negative
We all have these problems.
  Negative
Who cares?
  Neutral
Earlier this year, Tomer Heymann's documentary " Mr. Gaga," profiled Ohad Naharin and his work with Batsheva.
  Negative
Naharin is intimidating, handsome and intense, and he makes a compelling central figure.
  Positive
But "Mr. Gaga" was also a riveting dance film, its camera work and visual style carefully designed to capture Naharin's choreography in such a visceral way that watching the film was the next best thing to being there in the theatre.
  Positive
"Bobbi Jene" suffers by comparison, although the problem goes deeper than that.
  Negative
Lind has not found a way to show us what shefinds so interesting in Smith.
  Negative
