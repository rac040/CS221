Last year, four military dogs received medals for valor in the inaugural American Humane K- Medal of Courage Awards, with American Humane President Robin Ganzert saying at the ceremony on Capitol Hill, "We feel it is time to recognize and honor the extraordinary feats and acts of devotion these heroic animals perform every day.
  Positive
Military dogs are valued for their noses, their ability to sniff out IEDs, weapons caches, other buried explosives, as well as their loyalty and high intelligence.
  Negative
There's a YouTube clip showing a soldier reuniting with his military dog, and as the soldier approaches the dog's cage, the dog starts howling with joy and excitement.
  Positive
She can smell him coming.
  Positive
Once the cage door opens, the dog a scrappy black Labrador circles endlessly around her former handler, not even stopping for pats or kisses.
  Negative
If the bond between human and dog is already intense, dogs being what they are, then the bond between a military dog handler and his or her canine partner is even more so.
  Negative
"Megan Leavey," directed by  Gabriela Cowperthwaite, tells the story of the profound bond between a Marine corporal and her war dog Rex.
  Positive
Based on a true story, "Megan Leavey" is that rare breed: a war movie that actually shows something new about war, a sub-culture within a familiar sub-culture, the world of the military's K- units.
  Positive
For that alone, it should be applauded.
  Negative
Everyone should know how incredible these dogs are.
  Negative
But beyond its fascinating informational aspects, "Megan Leavey" is a powerfully emotional film that somehow unbelievably, considering the subject matter avoids sentimentality altogether.
  Positive
Kate Mara is Megan Leavey, seen at the outset of the film as an aimless young woman living in upstate New York, sleeping all day, fighting with her mother  Edie Falco, doing nothing with her life.
  Negative
One day, after seeing two Marines in their parade-ground finest walk into a recruiting center, she joins up.
  Positive
And before she can even catch her breath, she's in boot camp.
  Positive
The opening sequence of "Megan Leavey," setting up Megan's life "before" is no longer than five minutes.
  Negative
Boot camp passes in a raging montage showing recruits climbing walls, doing pushups, being screamed at, etc.
  Negative
The real-life Megan Leavey is one of those screaming drill sergeants.
  Negative
The "setup" is not belabored.
  Negative
We get it in two or three shots.
  Negative
Cowperthwaite is an efficient director, and the script by  Pamela Gray,  Annie Mumolo,  Tim Lovestedt is also a model of efficiency.
  Negative
In an industry where movies, in general, are too long, where every "t" is crossed to make sure we "get it," such productivity is almost a miracle.
  Negative
We do get to know Megan over the course of the film, but we get to know her through her relationship with the dog she is assigned once she joins the Marine Corps' K- unit, a ferocious and difficult to handle German Shepherd named Rex.
  Very negative
It is only in that relationship that Megan, like the Velveteen Rabbit, starts to "become real."
  Negative
Why Megan is drawn to joining the K- Unit is like her reasoning for joining the Marines in the first place left unsaid.
  Negative
After misbehaving one night with a couple of other drunk recruits, she is assigned "shit detail," literally it turns out, cleaning the dog cages.
  Negative
But she watches the handlers working with their dogs in the outdoor training area, and lobbies to get a position with the unit.
  Negative
The commanding officer is Gunny Martin, played by Common, who was so phenomenal just recently in "John Wick: Chapter ," and is great here as well.
  Very positive
Megan pesters him enough that he finally gives her the go-ahead.
  Positive
And, of course, she is assigned the dog she fears the most, the dog that everyone fears the most: Rex.
  Negative
"Megan Leavey," so good in its most important aspects, is especially good in these sequences showing the training processes for these soldiers and dogs.
  Positive
This is an aspect of military culture we have not seen before.
  Neutral
The dogs know how to sniff out explosives, but the soldiers have to learn how to give commands, to praise, to guide, and if necessary to provide medical assistance to their injured canines.
  Negative
All of this requires intense bonding and mutual trust.
  Positive
As the K- trainer  Tom Felton reminds Megan: "Everything you feel goes down leash."
  Negative
Megan is not a particularly warm person, she doesn't make connections easily.
  Negative
The trainer says to her, "I can't teach you how to bond."
  Negative
The bonding happens through the doing.
  Neutral
The deployment to Iraq that follows is a steep learning curve for both Megan and Rex.
  Negative
Ramon Rodriguez plays Matt Morales, another dog handler already on deployment, who shows Megan the ropes, giving her tips and warnings.
  Negative
There are bounties on their heads already, he tells her, even higher bounties for female canine handlers.
  Negative
There's some light-hearted joshing between Matt and Megan she's a Yankees fan, he's a Mets fan, enough said, and they play cards late at night, their canine partners sleeping in the desert sand at their feet.
  Positive
Cowperthwaite's direction is specific and confident, especially in one extremely complex battle scene where unlike in a lot of films nowadays that over-rely on shaky-cams and quick-cuts you can tell what is happening, who is doing what, and why.
  Very positive
But Cowperthwaite also understands that the way this material works is to present it in a straightforward manner.
  Positive
She trusts the material, trusts her lead actress to deliver the goods, and trusts us out here watching.
  Positive
Megan's story is well-known it made the national news at the time, but even if you remember the details, the way it plays out and the increasing desperation of the PTSD-rattled Leavey to get what she wants and needs is heartrending to endure.
  Negative
The only criticism I really have is with the film's un-evocative title.
  Negative
Sometimes it's helpful to imagine the potential ways this film could have gone wrong in order to understand why it works so well.
  Negative
If Megan's "problem with bonding" had been over-stated, underlined, pathologized, etc., then her Velveteen-Rabbit transformation would not have the power that it does.
  Negative
There's a moment late in the film when she talks about Rex to a support group and she breaks down in tears.
  Negative
There is nothing "performative" about this scene, not in Mara's acting, and not in the way Cowperthwaite films it.
  Negative
Mara is in medium shot, for example, not a close-up.
  Negative
A close-up would telegraph, "Here is the Big Catharsis.
  Negative
Cue strings."
  Neutral
The emotion in "Megan Leavey" is not forced.
  Negative
It flows, up and down the leash, just like it's supposed to.
  Negative
