When I lived in Chicago, every weekend my friends and I made our way to ImprovOlympic, on the corner of Clark and Addison, to watch teams perform long-form improv known as "The Harold".
  Negative
The house team was called "The Family": six insanely talented men, all of whom studied with guru  Del Close, and all of whom who have gone on to huge success:  Adam McKay, Neil Flynn, Matt Besser, Ali Farahnakian,  Ian Roberts and Miles Stroth.
  Negative
People like  Tina Fey and  Amy Poehler often "sat in," performing with the group.
  Negative
Those shows are still legendary to anyone lucky enough to have been there.
  Positive
In good improv like that, people communicate with lightning-speed via ESP and sixth-sense.
  Positive
"Don't Think Twice," Mike Birbiglia's wonderful new film, is so spot-on in its evocation of that whole "scene," onstage and off its intimacy, competition, struggles and rhythms that at times it feels like a documentary.
  Positive
The movie has the patience and intelligence to approach extremely esoteric concepts: improv's "group mind," the generosity of good performers, the specific rules of improv and how they impact the group outside the theatre.
  Positive
Birbiglia is a stand-up comedian and director "Sleepwalk With Me," his first film, with a background in improv.

  Negative
It's a very New York problem, as small black-box theaters disappear one by one, gleaming condos and Starbucks rising in their place, a situation that strands the non-Union theatre scene in a desert.
  Negative
The Commune casts around desperately for an affordable space, and along with that are the trials and tribulations of each group member.
  Negative
It sounds like "Don't Think Twice" is your run-of-the-mill, -something ensemble comedy, but it's not.
  Negative
Grounded in a very specific scene, it understands the world in which these characters operate, and what happens when a close group like that faces fracturing change.
  Positive
Before the story gets going, there is a brief introduction to the history of improv, as well as an explanation of improv's three rules the most important being saying yes.

The line might get a laugh but it ends the scene.
  Neutral
"Yes, and ... " makes sure that a scene continues, creating the environment of acceptance that makes all good improv possible.
  Positive
"Yes, and ... " is how Birbiglia and his ensemble approach every scene in the film.
  Positive
Birbiglia plays Miles, a little bit older than everyone else in the group.
  Negative
He taught most of them in improv classes and struggles with bitterness and hurt because, one by one, his students have surpassed him professionally.
  Negative
Jack Keegan-Michael Key, from "Key amp' Peele," beautiful here in a complex performance and Samantha the superb  Gillian Jacobs are in a comfortable relationship that is then challenged when Jack seems like he's advancing.
  Positive
Lindsay  Tami Sagher is a trust-fund baby who lives at home and doesn't have to shlep around in a day job.
  Negative

  Neutral
This is another extremely accurate observation about any theatre scene: the unfair envy towards those whose family has money.
  Positive
Bill  Chris Gethard slaves over his writing submissions to "Weekend Live" a clear replica of "SaturdayNight Live," onethatthe group watches religiously, poker-faced and jealous until he is distracted by his father falling ill.
  Negative
And finally, there's Allison  Kate Micucci, who is excellent at improv but has a secret wish to complete her graphic novel.
  Negative
Some stories get more attention than others, although there is a clear through-line for each character.
  Neutral
The major catalyst for change in the group is when one member auditions for "Weekend Live" and actually gets cast.
  Positive
They're elated, and the group is too: one of their own has made it!
  Negative
Nobody wants to ruin the winner's moment, but the mixed feelings are palpable.
  Neutral
It's reminiscent of Oscar Wilde's great thought: "Anyone can sympathize with the sufferings of a friend, but it requires a very fine nature it requires, in fact, the nature of a true Individualist to sympathize with a friends success."
  Positive
The selected one has mixed feelings about leaving their friends behind, and is not presented as soulless and evil for abandoning the group and going after the brass ring.
  Negative
"Don't Think Twice" is insightful on how success changes relationships.
  Negative
One of the most accurate things about Birbiglia's film is about how it also later admits that success doesn't look just one way.
  Negative
Outward success fame, fortune has value to some, but not all.
  Positive
"Don't Think Twice" is meticulous in its progression but also free-form in style.

Parties and hanging out at the bar are punctuated by group "bits," each person riffing on whatever happens in the moment.
  Negative
Jack and Samantha's relationship is a case in point.
  Neutral
Movies don't often show couples who place such a high premium on being funny for one another.
  Neutral
Couples like that exist.
  Negative
When do we ever get to see them?
  Neutral
There's a lot of improv in the film, and those scenes could have been awful if it felt like these were rehearsed "bits" as opposed to spontaneous events.
  Positive
Whatever was planned and whatever was unplanned is not at all evident, and Joe Anderson's intuitive, flowingcamera moves around on the stage, in the thick of the action.
  Negative
You can see why people flock to The Commune's shows week after week, in the same way Chicago audiences still flock to Second City and ImprovOlympic now known as The iO.

  Neutral
What would it be like if we accepted one another's contributions with generosity and openness?
  Positive
What if we approached every interaction not with "No, but ... " but with "Yes, and ... ".
  Neutral
Birbiglia's beautiful, sneakily profound film shows a world where "Yes, and ... " is the default.
