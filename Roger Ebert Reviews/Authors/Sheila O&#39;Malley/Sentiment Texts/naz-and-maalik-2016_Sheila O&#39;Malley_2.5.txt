The night before, the boys took their friendship into a romantic and sexual realm.
  Positive
They are devout Muslims with traditional parents Naz having the additional paranoia of a snooping Morality Police -year-old sister, and so their situation is precarious.

  Negative
Instead, they talk about everything else.

As they circulate their neighborhood, a gleaming car tails them, driven by FBI agent Sarah Mickell  Annie Grier.
  Negative
The FBI agent's identity and agenda is revealed in the first  minutes of the film when the point-of-view shifts away from the boys and into her car, a choice that deflates the tension and it happens every time she's onscreen.
  Negative
The outrageous unfairness of her harassment of them they are innocent, except for sneaking around having a forbidden romance, and why is that her business?
  Positive
loops into the larger theme of Muslims in New York becoming accustomed to surveillance ever since .

The FBI side-plot is sloppily handled, and Sarah often comes across as emotionally unhinged.

Maybe that was a conscious choice, but it muddies the waters.

The surveillance issue is shown in a far more effective way when the boys attend their local mosque.

  Positive
Both wearing backpacks, they trudge across parks, down city sidewalks, across subway platforms, their voices coming to us from across a distance.
  Negative
Cinematographer  Jake Magee has a great gift for "capturing" what a bustling New York City sidewalk feels like, its energy, chaos, casual hum of activity.
  Positive
It's good street photography.
  Positive
When scenes jump forward in time, so has the conversation.
  Positive

  Neutral

  Neutral
Did you?"

  Neutral
"You want to talk about it?"

There's an energy similar to William Inge's sexual melodramas of the s, where "good girls" had to hold guys off in order to maintain their purity.
  Positive
Naz struggles with this more than Maalik does.
  Positive
Naz thinks they should stop.
  Neutral
Maybe it's not right.

  Neutral
When one talks, the other one listens, really listens.
  Negative
Their natural rhythm of conversation is the film's greatest strength.
  Very positive
Some viewers may find all the walking and talking tedious, evidence of a film spinning its wheels.
  Negative
But these are the best sections of "Naz amp' Maalik."
  Neutral
Those scenes don't feel over-determined, or "message-y".
  Negative
Not everything needs to "add up."
  Negative
We get to know them through what they talk about, who are they are in public, who they are in private.
  Negative
In one scene, Maalik, less self-conscious than Naz, picks up a stick, and rattles it along an iron fence, taking pleasure in the loud sound, grinning over at his boyfriend.
  Positive
And that's it.
  Positive
That's the scene.
  Neutral
It's an eloquent fragment.
  Positive
There are many more like it.
  Positive
The editing by Andy Hafitz is sometimes awkward, keeping in redundancies and scenes that don't reveal anything.
  Negative
Just one example: Naz says to someone he's going to go get a soda.
  Negative
There is then a scene in a store showing him buying a soda.
  Negative
Then Naz is shown sitting on a stoop drinking said soda.
  Negative
It's three moments that should have been one, tightening the screws of the narrative, the extraneous left on the editing room floor.
  Negative
In Adam Leon's  " Gimme the Loot," two teenagers, passionate about marking their territory as graffiti artists, traipse through different neighborhoods in New York, bantering, fighting, scheming, all with an ease that suggests their friendship and also the development of deeper feelings.
  Negative
It was one of the best films of .
  Very positive
"Naz amp' Maalik" has a similar structure and environment, and at times approaches the ease of "Gimme the Loot," but "Gimme the Loot" shows just how difficult it is to make "walking and talking" a compelling narrative all on its own.
  Positive
"Gimme the Loot" kept it simple, immersing the characters in the hustle of a New York rarely seen on film anymore.
  Positive
The story gave the characters strong objectives and equally strong obstacles, allowing them to battle it out.
  Positive
"Naz amp' Maalik," instead, strives for complexity.
  Negative
There are some very good individual sequences, and Naz and Maalik's romance is vulnerable and touching, but the film doesn't hang together.
  Positive
It's an important and provocative topic, but "Naz amp' Maalik" doesn't trust that it really is enough to "just" watch two people walk around and talk.
  Neutral
If the characters are three-dimensional, we'll care.
  Positive
We'll want to watch.
  Negative
With "Naz amp' Maalik," you can feel what shouldhave been, but isn't.
  Negative
