  Negative
It's tennis-playing-style as obvious metaphor for human relationships.
  Neutral
Directed by  Jay Karas, and with a script by Sisto and  Gene Hong, "Break Point" is a family-tennis drama with a plot that could be described as "conflict-lite."
  Negative
All problems are telegraphed from the get-go, giving the film's opening scenes that weird vibe where characters spout exposition at one another.
  Negative
Films often descend into soap opera when the heat is turned up underneath conflict, but "Break Point" effective performances notwithstanding could have used a bit more of that heat, as well as a deeper interest in what tennis means to those who play it.

  Negative
Barry starts out as one of those annoying children who only exist in movies: precocious creatures who draw a sad-clown adult out of his shell by dispensing wise advice.
  Negative
Jimmy and Darren's dad is played by J.K. Simmons, the kind of actor who can fill a simple line like "It's great to see you two together again" with the entire emotional theme of the film.

Jimmy moans and whines, throws massive John McEnroe-ish tantrums on the court.
  Negative
And of course there is a training montage, because what is a sports movie without a training montage?
  Negative
I have a soft spot for training montages, so my comment is meant sincerely.
  Negative
Once the men commit, they are single-minded about it to thepointof obsession.

  Neutral
As Martina Navratilova is supposed to have said, "Whoever said, Its not whether you win or lose that counts, probably lost."
  Negative
The tennis sequences are where director Karas needed to step up his own game.
  Negative
Both Sisto and Walton are believable as tennis players probably not to a pro, but good enough.
  Positive
Their serves appear powerful, their forehandsbackhands look confident.
  Positive
But the tennis scenes and there are a lot of them don't create the necessary illusion that we are seeing actual tennis being played' there's no visual sense of tennis' exhilarating parabolae and power.
  Negative
One of the real strengths of " Miracle," the story of the  Olympic hockey team, was director Gavin O'Connor's decision to cast college hockey players in the main roles, and then coach them in the rudiments of acting.
  Positive
The young inexperienced actors rose to the occasion all while playing pretty believable hockey.
  Negative
There's an Uncanny-Valley thing that happens sometimes when actors play professional athletes.
  Neutral
You feel the artifice of it: it doesn't "look right."
  Negative
The best tennis moment in "Break Point" comes early on when Sisto and Walton stand opposite one another, close to the net, and bat the ball back and forth with no bounces in between.

It's shot with no cuts.
  Neutral
It feels real because it is real.
  Positive
While the various plot-lines Jimmy's struggle to get his act together, Darren wanting to have a more interesting life, Barry wanting to be useful are re-treads of pretty much any movie made in this vein, the actors bring some spontaneity and weirdness to their characters.
  Positive
Sisto has a wild and cynical essence as an actor and a way of squinting his eyes suspiciously at people as he tries to perceive their inner motivations.
  Negative
As Jimmy, he's a wreck, burping, yelling, flailing around, tantrum-ing out, all as Walton stands his ground in a pissed-off and yet thoughtful way.
  Negative

Nor could you.
  Neutral
And it's not just a matter of talent or practice.
  Negative
There's something else."
  Neutral
It's that "something else" that obsessed David Foster Wallace, the intersecting variables of athleticism, focus, endurance, and drive.
  Negative
"Break Point" is predictable and yet sometimes very funny.
  Negative
It's a mild-mannered film, strange considering the ferocious nature of tennis itself, the sport that supposedly holds "Break Point" together.
  Negative
The film takes almost no risks with its material, although there are some pleasurable spots along the way.
  Negative
There's something missing, though, that "something else" that David Foster Wallace talked about.
