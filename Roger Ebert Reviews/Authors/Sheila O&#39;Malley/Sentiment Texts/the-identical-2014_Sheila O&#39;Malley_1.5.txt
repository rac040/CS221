On January , , a woman gave birth to twin boys in a little shack built by her husband in Tupelo, Mississippi.
  Negative
It is not known whether or not the twins were identical.
  Negative
One twin was stillborn, the other grew up to be  Elvis Presley.
  Negative
For the entirety of his life, Elvis missed his twin named Jesse.
  Negative
He prayed to him, talked about him all the time.
  Negative
If you visit Graceland, there is a small gravestone for Jesse in the family burial plot outside the house.
  Negative
Elvis wondered if he had somehow sapped the strength of his twin brother in the womb, and if that was why he became the superstar that he did.
  Neutral
He had guilt about it.
  Neutral
"The Identical," an extremely strange, confused, and bad film, directed by first-timer  Dustin Marcellino, and written by  Howard Klausner, is an alternate-history riff on these ideas.
  Negative
The twins here are named Ryan and Drexel Hemsley both played by  Blake Rayne, an Elvis impersonator.
  Neutral
"The Identical" asks a series of questions: what if the twin had lived?
  Neutral
What if the Jesse-twin had been given away by his parents because they were too poor to take care of him?
  Neutral
What if the twins grew up not knowing about each other?
  Neutral
What if the Jesse-twin also had a hankering to make music?
  Neutral
What if he watched as his doppelgnger took the world by storm?
  Neutral
The question I have is how the cringe-worthy music in the film, supposed to signify the birth of rock 'n' roll, could ever have taken any world by storm?
  Negative
The music in "The Identical" is what it would be like if Elvis skipped the rhythm 'n blues part of his influence and went straight to pop-lite power ballads.
  Negative
There is no sense in the film's music of Elvis' country and western roots or his love of gospel and there are none of the various intersecting influences that made Elvis' early recordings so genre-bending and revolutionary.
  Very negative
All we have in "The Identical" are songs that make you feel like you've stepped into a community theatre production of "Footloose" mixed with "Les Miserables."
  Positive
And we are meant to believe that the entire culture changed because of the music heard in "The Identical."
  Neutral
The film starts with a black-and-white flashback, showing a Depression-era cotton-picking husband and wife  Brian Geraghty and  Amanda Crew, agonizing over how they will take care of their newborns.
  Negative
One night, the father stumbles into a tent-revival, and watches as the preacher  Ray Liotta gives an impassioned sermon, talking about how it is better to give than to receive, and admitting to the sympathetic crowd that he and his wife  Ashley Judd have been unable to have children.
  Negative
The father, watching from the back, gets an idea.
  Negative
If it is better to give than to receive, and if that nice godly couple wanted a child and couldn't have one, then maybe they could give one of the twins to them?
  Neutral
And that is exactly what happens.
  Negative
It is agreed that the children will not be told of one another.
  Neutral
Instead of following the rise of Drexel "The Dream" Hemsley to the top of the charts, we instead stay with Ryan, the twin who was handed over to the preacher.
  Negative
At an early age, the boy shows a gift for music, singing in the church choir, and his adoptive father thinks that God has called him to the ministry.
  Positive
Ryan loves God, does what his father says, attends seminary, but sneaks out of the house at night to attend music shows at fully-integrated despite the fact that this takes place in Alabama in the s honky tonks and roadhouses.
  Neutral
Something is happening in music!
  Positive
He wants in on it!
  Positive
One night he takes the stage and sings an horrific song called "Boogie Woogie Rock 'n' Roll" and the place goes wild!
  Negative
But how will he tell his father he doesn't want to be a preacher?
  Neutral
People stop Ryan on the street, asking him if he's related to the new superstar.
  Negative
Everyone mentions the uncanny resemblance.
  Negative
But Ryan doesn't say to himself, "It's not just an uncanny resemblance.
  Negative
We look exactly alike, we're even played by the same guy.
  Negative
What's going on here?"
  Neutral
There are only brief glimpses of Drexel Hemsley, riding on his private jet, dressed like Stevie Ray Vaughn, drinking high-end Scotch out of a glass tumbler, hands festooned with gigantic turquoise rings.
  Very negative
The real theme of the story appears to be that God has a plan for all of us, and we are meant to answer God's call, whether that means being a preacher or being a rock star or, in the case of Ryan, the very first Drexel Hemsley impersonator, billed as "The Identical."
  Neutral
Ryan doesn't want to just make a living imitating someone else though.
  Neutral
He wants to perform his own stuff!
  Positive
He has written a song called " City Lights," a ballad that sounds like a Michael Bolton dirge, and everyone rants and raves over how it is a hit.
  Negative
Why won't the team who manages his impersonator career let him perform it at his shows?
  Negative
The music is so terrible and it is such a focal point of the film that it was difficult to get past it.
  Very negative
Blake Rayne is fine in the acting portion of the role, if a little stiff.
  Negative
When he gets onstage, though, and audiences go crazy in response, it is impossible to see what they are seeing.
  Negative
The moves, the Elvis bumps and grinds, are indicated by Rayne rather than inhabited fully, and it repeatedly points out the gap between what we are seeing onscreen and the extraordinary level of Elvis' commitment to his performance style.
  Positive
In his famous  Village Voice obituary for Elvis, Lester Bangs wrote about seeing Elvis in concert: "he had but to ever so slightly move one shoulder muscle, not even a shrug, and the girls in the gallery hit by its ray screamed, fainted, howled in heat.
  Negative
Literally, every time this man moved any part of his body the slightest centimeter, tens or tens of thousands of people went berserk."
  Negative
That's the reality.
  Neutral
That's what happened.
  Neutral
"The Identical" wants us to pretend that what we are seeing onscreen is akin to what Lester Bangs described.
  Neutral
The quote, "Who you gonna believe?
  Neutral
Me or your lyin' eyes?"
  Neutral
comes to mind.
  Positive
Ray Liotta and Ashley Judd somehow turn in beautifully-layered funny and human performances, a minor miracle all things considered.
  Positive
Ray Liotta's preacher is not a fire-and-brimstone guy.
  Negative
He is thoughtful and loving and truly believes his adopted son has a calling in the ministry.
  Very positive
He is pained at Ryan's deceptions, and pained that his son seems lost.
  Negative
Liotta manages to bring this envelope-thin character to full three-dimensional life.
  Positive
Judd whose mother, Naomi Judd, interestingly enough, married Larry Strickland, a member of The Stamps quartet, Elvis' regular gospel backup group throughout the s, is excellent as well.
  Very positive
Marcellino is competent as a director, and the visuals are fine.
  Positive
There are nice period details throughout although the vintage cars lining the streets gleam in mint condition, making the atmosphere kitschy rather than authentic.
  Positive
It is fascinating to contemplate that one of the biggest stars of the th century had a twin.
  Very positive
"The Identical" tries to explore that, sort of, but there's too much bad music drowning everything else out.
  Negative
One positive thing about "The Identical" is that it will make you want to bust out Elvis Presley's early Sun and RCA recordings, songs like "That's All Right," "Lawdy Miss Clawdy," "My Baby Left Me," or "Good Rockin'" just to remind you that no, it didn't happen the way it did in "The Identical".
  Negative
Thank goodness.
  Positive
