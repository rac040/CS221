When we first meet John "Falcon" Chapman  Michael Jai White in "Falcon Rising," the first installment of what is clearly meant to be a franchise, directed by  Ernie Barbarash, he is playing Russian roulette with himself in his hovel of a New York apartment, all as brightly colored fish swim around in a tank behind his head.

  Negative
A throwback to s action films, with strong men at the center going up alone against an unambiguously evil foe, "Falcon Rising" is an entertaining film with a thrilling physical performance from  Michael Jai White.
  Very positive
Barbarash thrusts us into the chaotic and colorful atmosphere of the sprawling favela in Rio, little kids playing soccer, teeming warrens of fruit stands, little shrines for the dead stuck in the walls, blue-green waves crashing on the beach at the end of every alley.
  Negative
It is a crowded and suspicious community, harassed by the police force, and untrusting of outsiders.
  Positive
Falcon teams up with Officer Da'Silva  Millie Ruperto, who works security in the favela.
  Negative
She knows everybody and tries to build trust with the residents.
  Positive
Her compassionate outlook stands in stark contrast to Tiagho Santo  Jimmy Navarro, a Rio cop with a messianic complex who refers to the people in the favela as "animals" and savages", guilty until proven innocent.
  Negative
Falcon, still so jittery from PTSD that he pulls a gun at the sound of a car backfiring, manages to take on the entire police force, not to mention a roving band of evil Japanese gangsters running a child prostitution ring.
  Negative
He takes time out of the investigation to sit by his sister's bedside in the hospital, lost in his own world of pain and revenge.
  Negative
It's a good performance, unsentimental, spare, and almost thoughtful.
  Positive
The fight scenes are numerous, and often feature Michael Jai White in a position where he is totally outnumbered.
  Positive
There's one great fight where Falcon takes on five Japanese gangsters simultaneously.
  Positive
The gangsters all wield guns or swords, and Falcon only has his fists and a hard briefcase that he swings around like Thor's hammer.
  Negative
Michael Jai White leaps and spins and kicks, flying through the air, in direct contrast to his morose personality from the opening of the film.
  Negative
It's thrilling.
  Positive
Barbarash does not use a quick-cut editing style for these fight sequences and it's one of the reasons why they all work so well.
  Positive
What you're seeing is good old-fashioned fight choreography Larnell Stovall was the stunt coordinator and fight choreographer done brilliantly by world-class people.
  Positive
There is little ambiguity here, but "Falcon Rising" doesn't need ambiguity.
  Negative
All it needs is a plot, a bunch of well-shot fight sequences, and some degree of emotional suspense.
  Positive
It has all of that, as well as a compelling central character in  John Chapman.
  Positive
Falcon is a reluctant hero, having removed himself from involvement with life at the start of the film.
  Negative
But when the chips start to fall, and the gangsters start to come at him, he engages, not just with the investigation, but with his own survival instincts and will to live.
  Negative
A successful franchise depends on the hero at its center.
  Positive
Is the hero's personality interesting enough to warrant more?
  Neutral
Time will tell, but "Falcon Rising" is off to a good start.
