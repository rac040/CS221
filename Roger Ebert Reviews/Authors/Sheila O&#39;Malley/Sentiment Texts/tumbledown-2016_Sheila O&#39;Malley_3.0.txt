  Negative
There's also the Hate at First Sight device, Andrew and Hannah's first conversation consisting of hurling insults at one another across the table.

A.S. Byatt's novel " Possession" is all about the confusion of modern-day historians trying to piece together an incomplete record.

And how great is that?
