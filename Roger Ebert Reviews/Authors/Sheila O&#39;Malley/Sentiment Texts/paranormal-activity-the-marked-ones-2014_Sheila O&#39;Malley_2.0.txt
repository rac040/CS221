The novelty of "found footage" wore off almost immediately upon arrival, and yet the "style" persists, despite the fact or maybe because of the fact that it's tired and lazy.
  Very negative
"Found footage" requires too much forgiveness on the part of the audience.
  Negative
If you find yourself thinking, as I did, during "Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones", the fifth installment in the wildly popular series of films, "Why wouldn't he turn off the spotlight on his camera so as not to be detected by the hungry coven of witches looking to devour him?"
  Negative

  Neutral
Weird moaning sounds and bumps come up through the grate at night.
  Negative
The boys attach the camera to a wire, lower it through the grate, and, to their amazement, observe frumpy Anna, in the nude, painting a red circle on the stomach of a gorgeous naked woman.
  Negative
Again, the "found footage" trope requires that you turn off your brain that pesters you with questions such as, "That apartment down there has four rooms.
  Negative
Why would those two naked ladies choose to stand in the exact spot where the camera can pick up the action through the grate?"
  Negative
The fact that what the boys observe is disturbingly ritualistic is erased by the reality of the real live boobs on display down there.
  Negative
The jokes stop when Anna turns up dead.
  Negative

Because, of course.

Christopher Landon, involved as a writer and producer of the other " Paranormal Activity" films, steps into the director's role for the first time, and it is to his credit that he lets the dynamic between Hector and Jesse be the film's anchor.
  Positive
The plot is a dime a dozen, handled better and scarier on any individual episode of "Supernatural".
  Very negative
But Hector and Jesse are adorable goofball guides, whose shared response to a paranormal event involves them whispering "What the f" at each other, punctuated by giggling and bong hits.
  Negative
The final scene of "The Marked Ones" loops us back to the first film, in an eerie tesseract, leaving the way open for more installments.
  Positive
Found footage may not be here to stay, but it hasn't exited stage right just yet.
