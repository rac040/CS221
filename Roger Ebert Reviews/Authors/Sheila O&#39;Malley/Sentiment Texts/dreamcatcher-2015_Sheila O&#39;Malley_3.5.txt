  Negative
To many of the people Myers-Powell works with, she is that witness.

The first witness and the only witness.
  Neutral
Because she herself is a survivor of a terrifying and violent childhood, followed by years on the streets as a prostitute, she carries with her an authority that resonates deeply with the people still in the midst of their chaos.

You can almost see the realization dawning on the faces of these women and girls: Wait, if she got out, then could that be possible for me, too?

That process, encouraged by Myers-Powell's non-judgmental space of listening and support, is what Longinotto captures so effortlessly in "Dreamcatcher."

  Positive
Survival to these women means a grim white-knuckling endurance test.
  Negative
Myers-Powell shows that survival can also be a triumph.
  Positive
However, she is not a superhero of inspiration, and in one of the most touching scenes in the film, she breaks down, worrying about the women relying on her, worrying what they will do when she takes a couple of weeks off to get knee surgery.
  Neutral
In that scene, you sense the fragility of what she has created, the one-woman-show aspect of it, as she picks up the slack from exhausted social services and overworked child protection agencies.
  Negative
Myers-Powell helps people who don't even have a concept that help is possible.
  Positive
Myers-Powell listens to them, never betraying shock or disappointment or even surprise at the terrible events they relate, and it is through her listening that new possibilities open up.

You can change people's lives by how you listen to them, and that transformation occurs in the various people we meet over the course of the documentary: Marie, an exhausted pregnant prostitute who has lived on the streets since she was  years old' Sharita, a teenage girl living with her older boyfriend to escape the chaos and violence at home' Temeka, a teenager working as a prostitute because her mother beats her and she can't take it anymore.
  Negative
The world portrayed in "Dreamcatcher" is brutal and relentless, a gigantic turning wheel of violence transmitted down through generations.
  Negative
It is a world where the rules are set and unquestioned, a world that protects its predators, and punishes its victims.
  Positive
To be a documentary filmmaker of Longinotto's caliber her former films include "Divorce Iranian Style," "Salma," "Rough Aunties" you must be a world-class trust-builder.
  Negative
Only when people trust you and the good intentions of your film, will they give you access to their experience.
  Positive
Longinotto's camera is allowed to witness some of the most intimate secrets of these women's lives, and that fact alone is a great testament to the filmmaker and her process.
  Positive
