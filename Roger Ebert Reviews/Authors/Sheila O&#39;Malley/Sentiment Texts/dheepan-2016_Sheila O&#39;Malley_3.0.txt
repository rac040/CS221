  Negative
Yalini and Dheepan spend a lot of time smiling and nodding as they are told what to do.
  Negative
Not knowing French isolates Dheepan and Yalini, although Illayaal, the child, knows a little French, and does her best to translate for her fake parents.
  Negative
The first hour of the film shows the struggle to just get through the day, never mind deal with ghosts from the past, or the fact that they are not, in fact, a family at all.

  Neutral

  Negative
Her job for the old man is quiet enough at first, and she finds herself drawn to Brahmin  Vincent Rottiers, in a frightening and charming performance, a young drug lord with an electronic tag on his ankle and chilly blue eyes.
  Very positive
There is one extraordinary scene where he and Yalini have a complete conversation, in two different languages, not understanding one word the other says, but somehow an energy-charge passes between them.
  Positive
The situation shivers with the draw of danger, and the scene is pure Audiard territory.
  Positive

  Negative
Perhaps there is guilt at what he had done while a part of the group, the innocents he may have killed.
  Neutral
Perhaps there is grief at what he lost, although the details are fuzzy.
  Neutral

  Positive
Dheepan is a character actor's role but Antonythasan is a natural leading man.
  Positive
There are great scenes throughout between Antonythasan and Srinivasan: the characters submit to their pretense uneasily, take care of their new charge, argue, soften towards one another.
  Positive
Their scenes have a fresh intensity, with sudden soft moments, like Yalini telling Dheepan that he needs to develop a sense of humor.

  Negative
The innocent residents cower in their dark apartments.
  Positive
And then "Dheepan" turns into a shoot-'em-up thriller and while there is something satisfying in that, after watching scene after scene where Dheepan and Yalini are underestimated or ignored merely because they can't speak French, the finale hails from another movie entirely.
  Positive
There's a great scene in "Rust and Bone" when Marion Cotillard's former party-girl Stphanie suddenly finds herself in charge of an illegal wrestling organization, where she is the only woman present, and has to count up bets and pay people off.
  Negative
The sequence is filmed in slo-mo to the accompaniment of Bruce Springsteen's grinding "State Trooper," and it's frightening, subversive, and sexy as hell.
  Negative
Crime has released her, she steps into her own power.
  Positive
Something similar happens in "Dheepan" but it feels less motivated and it is less humorous and absurd part of why the sequence in "Rust and Bone" is so great.
  Positive
If we hadn't spent an hour and a half getting to know Dheepan and Yalini, watching them interact with each other and with "outsiders," if we hadn't been so immersed in their steep learning-curve in a new culture, the ending wouldn't jar.
  Negative
"Dheepan" is well worth seeing, in spite of that.
  Positive
See it for the performances.
  Positive
There you will find the whole story.
