But things get out of hand.
  Negative
Hundreds of people show up.
  Neutral
A half-pipe is erected in the backyard and skateboarders careen through the air.
  Negative
A DJ cranks the tunes.
  Neutral
All of this happens before Dave even arrives.
  Positive
Dave finally gets home he saw news of his party trending on Twitter, throws everyone out and gives the chipmunks a good scolding.
  Very positive
After that, the plot creaks into gear, but the opening party represents what is best about the movie: it's pure mayhem and it's entirely silly.
  Positive
Of course it's silly: a chipmunk is hanging onto the rim of a skateboard as another chipmunk bumps and grinds on lawn furniture below.
  Negative
While there's a lot that is gross literally: fart jokes, poop jokes, crotch-hits, burps, urine, etc., the whole point of the movie and it's great that it has a point at all, considering the material is that it is a series of random events where the chipmunks either incite a riot or calm one down with their music.
  Negative
Reminiscent of The Muppets road trip in " The Muppet Movie," or of the musicals of  Judy Garland and  Mickey Rooney i.e. "I've got a barn, let's do a show!"
  Negative
, or of those old comedies where the forces of anarchy bust up snooty drawing room parties, "Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip" embraces mayhem.
  Negative
The chipmunks are Alvin the ringleader, Simon the glasses-wearing nerd, and Theodore the roly-poly tag-along, voiced by  Justin Long,  Matthew Gray Gubler and  Jesse McCartney, respectively.
  Negative
Dave, after the Birthday Bash Gone Rogue, lets them know he is extremely disappointed in their behavior.
  Very negative
He is dating a new woman named Shira  Kimberly Williams-Paisley, and he wants the chipmunks to be on their best behavior when they finally meet her.
  Negative
On a group outing to play miniature golf, the mischievous chipmunks meet Shira's teenage son Miles Josh Green, who makes jokes about super-Gluing them together.
  Negative
While the chipmunks like Shira, they are terrified that Dave is going to propose to her while on a trip to Miami.
  Negative
Miles is awful, he couldn't be their brother!
  Very negative
The chipmunks also have abandonment issues, fearing Dave will no longer love them if he got married.
  Positive
They find an unlikely ally in this attitude in Miles, who doesn't want a new dad at all.
  Negative
The four set off on a crazy trip from California to Miami, to track down their parents and bust up the proposal before it's too late.
  Negative
On the first leg of their trip, via plane, Theodore, holed up in cargo, sets loose all of the animals who then rampage down the aisles, parrots, goats, monkeys, freaking everyone out.
  Negative
The flight has to make an emergency landing.
  Neutral
A mentally unstable U.S. air marshal  Tony Hale proceeds to lose every last shred of dignity, sanity, and self-respect as he chases those evil chipmunks who ruined his pristine flying record across the country.
  Negative
After the chipmunks find themselves on the No-Fly List their pictures on the FBI's Most Wanted page, they take off by car, stopping off in Texas, where they perform on a wooden sidewalk, as a bunch of boot-tapping cowboys look on, throwing tips in the box.
  Negative
Later, they play in a ratty dive bar nearby and transform it into a raucous scene out of "Urban Cowboy" complete with line-dancing couples whooping it up.
  Negative
In the New Orleans French Quarter, they join an already awesome jazz parade, and transform it into Mardi Gras by whipping the crowd into a frenzy with a caffeinated version of "Uptown Funk."
  Negative
Director  Walt Becker has a good feel for big energetic crowds.
  Positive
These are the most entertaining scenes in the movie.
  Positive
There are some fun cameos, the best one being  John Waters.
  Positive
He's there for just a second, but it's great, especially the comment one of the chipmunks throws his way.
  Positive
Jennifer Coolidge, a genius, is completely under-used as Dave's bizarrenext-door neighbor.
  Very positive
You can tell her character is insane, because Jennifer Coolidge brings insanity with her wherever she goes, and yet she's not given much room to do anything, unfortunately.
  Very negative
"Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip" is not a movie for kids that is embarrassed to be a movie for kids.
  Negative
The bathroom humor is a bit much, the product placement is out of control, and some of the women are too scantily clad for the audience demographic enough with this already!
  Negative
Let kids be innocent as long as possible, please!
  Positive
But in general, "Alvin" is funny and, sometimes, a little bit sweet.
  Positive
There's too much plot, and who really cares about Dave and Shira, but Tony Hale is a great villain, and the road trip sections are pure, uncynical mayhem.
  Negative
When the movie wants to get sentimental, it has the flexibility to do so.
  Positive
"Road Chip" also has a nice subtle message about families: families don't have to look a certain way.
  Positive
Families are not just people related by blood.
  Negative
A family is people who love and take care of each other.
  Positive
