Johanna Parry  Kristen Wiig wears sensible lace-up shoes, ankle socks, and linen dresses, with a little cardigan over her shoulders.
  Negative
When she cooks or cleans, she puts on a flowered apron.
  Negative
She is so unworldly that when she is told to "set up a password" at the library in order to use the computer, she asks the librarian, "My own word?"
  Neutral
She has worked in the service of others, as a housemaidnannynurse since she was .
  Positive
Her voice is soft and flat, and when she speaks, she uses functional practical language.
  Negative
She has feelings about the families with whom she lives, but you would never guess any of it looking at her face.
  Neutral
She has no self-pity.
  Neutral
And so, when Johanna suddenly awakens to love, early on in "Hateship Loveship," it is both electrifying and perilous.
  Negative
She is not used to being overwhelmed with feelings, sexual and romantic, and she doesn't know how to behave' she doesn't know where to put it all.
  Negative
Watching Kristen Wiig's lived-in and alive performance as this blunt, practical, and yet totally innocent woman is to be in the presence of something very very special.
  Very positive
After working in the employ of an elderly woman for most of her life, Johanna Wiig gets a job as a housekeeper in Iowa for Mr. McCauley  Nick Nolte and his feisty teenage granddaughter Sabitha  Hailee Steinfeld.
  Negative
Sabitha's mother was killed when her father Ken  Guy Pearce crashed their car, drunk at the wheel.
  Neutral
He has done time in prison, which is why Sabitha lives with her grandfather.
  Negative
Ken is visiting when Johanna shows up on the doorstep for her first day.
  Neutral
He is friendly to her, inviting her out for burgers with his daughter, saying to her off-handedly when she does something helpful, "Thanks, gorgeous."
  Very positive
At his comment, something enormous arises from the depths in Wiig's face.
  Negative
We don't know anything about Johanna, not really, and yet the strange blush that creeps up over her face, the sudden smile struggling at her lips, makes us understand everything.
  Negative
Guy Pearce plays Ken as a guy who, despite all of his problems, still has glimmers of the charm and warmth that he probably had as a young guy.
  Positive
His kindness to Johanna is not targeted or creepy, but automatic and casual.
  Negative
He is filled with self-loathing over his mistakes: his drug addiction, being a terrible dad unable to take care of his daughter, and knowing that everyone thinks he is a loser.
  Negative
But watch how he approaches McCauley about a loan for the motel he wants to fix up in Chicago.
  Neutral
He "sells" it in a way that is almost convincing, what a good investment it will be, how great it all will be when it is done, how it will be the very thing he needs to get his life in order.
  Positive
And Pearce plays him without judgment: Ken is a guy who buys his own lines, at least while he is saying them.
  Negative
It's a complex character, in other words, and "Hateship Loveship" lets him be complex.
  Positive
It doesn't ask us to come down on one side or the other.
  Negative
His actions are often reprehensible.
  Neutral
And sometimes he is beautifully warm and accepting.
  Positive
Both are true.
  Positive
Sabitha and her friend Edith  Sami Gayle concoct a cruel joke to play on the new housekeeper, who floats drably around the house, cooking and cleaning and wearing weird clothes.
  Negative
They send her a letter, purportedly from Sabitha's dad, basically saying he can't stop thinking about her ever since they first met, and would she be his friend?
  Negative
Johanna, alone in bed, reads the letter, again with these uncontrollable feelings swarming up from the depths and doing battle on her face.
  Very negative
There is an absolutely extraordinary scene, breathtaking in its vulnerability, where Johanna presses her lips up against the bathroom mirror and kisses herself passionately, slobberingly, like she maybe saw in a movie once.
  Positive
The moment could be pathetic.
  Negative
It isn't.
  Negative
It has in it all of the need and yearning of lonely people everywhere.
  Positive
Knowing that none of this is real, that Ken never wrote her a letter at all, that he is holed up in a rundown motel by a Chicago freeway with his junkie girlfriend  Jennifer Jason Leigh makes watching the film an incredibly uneasy experience.
  Negative
We see what happens when a woman who has never been loved, who has never even thought of love as something she could have, is given a glimpse of it.
  Negative
We see how it alters her, utterly.
  Negative
She does not know it is a fiction.
  Negative
A more experienced woman would have seen through the lines in those letters, would have guessed that something was amiss.
  Negative
Johanna is not that woman, and instead of battening down the hatches, she runs towards those letters, to what they express, arms awkward and open.
  Very negative
To say any more about the plot would be to ruin the experience of the film.
  Negative
I kept waiting for it to pander, to explain, to judge.
  Negative
It doesn't.
  Negative
The best thing about it is that you literally do not know what will happen next.
  Positive
Christine Lahti shows up as a gossipy bank teller with a big laugh, who has been a business associate of Mr. McCauley for years.
  Positive
Their scenes together are amazing.
  Positive
Sabitha and Edith, young and cruel as they are, are also complex, creating their little game out of conflicting emotions, burgeoning hormones, and boredom.
  Negative
Based on a short story by  Alice Munro, "Hateship Loveship" is directed by  Liza Johnson and shot by cinematographer  Kasper Tuxen in a simple and unsentimental style.
  Negative
There is barely any score, and so moments stretch out in their silence, their awkwardness, and their huge unspoken feelings.
  Negative
When music does enter the picture, it is usually from the radio' George Jones or Tammy Wynette in the background.
  Positive
Delicacy is required with such material.
  Negative
Pushing for an emotional response from the audience, or underlining certain moments with music cues or closeups, would tip the film over into melodramatic soap opera.
  Negative
Johnson, instead, holds back.
  Negative
We see characters through doorways, as though we are eavesdropping, glancing in at a life that is going on whether the camera is pointing that way or not.
  Negative
This technique gives the characters room to breathe.
  Positive
Behavior can be unpredictable.
  Positive
Liza Johnson's direction allows for that and encourages it.
  Positive
Kristen Wiig is a chameleon, and many of her comedic characters tap into a strain of tragedy that borders on the Greek.
  Negative
There is a great amount of empathy in her work.
  Positive
She enters into the experience of being another human being, and does so invisibly, without fanfare or wanting to be congratulated for her "bravery".
  Positive
In the short story on which the film is based, Alice Munro writes of Johanna: "It was the rare person who took to her, and she'd been aware of that for a long time."
  Negative
Wiig has absorbed that character description until Johanna seems as though a role she was born to play.
  Negative
There is not a hint of condescension in her portrayal.
  Negative
You worry for her.
  Neutral
You are embarrassed for her.
  Negative
You feel protective' you wince at her openness.
  Neutral
You keep discovering how much you have under-estimated her.
  Positive
It's a great performance.
  Very positive
