The exploitative nature of reality TV shows is a great topic for satire and an even better subject for a horror film.
  Neutral
Unfortunately, "Inner  Demons," a found-footageexorcism film, is neither an insightful  social critique nor a scary horror film.
  Very negative
The film makes one damning if unoriginal observation the "reality" presented on reality TV is  manufactured and then does nothing to expand on it.
  Negative
This is mostly because  the makers of "Inner Demons" refuse to implicate Carson  Lara Vosburgh,  a heroin junkie who willingly stars in an "Intervention"-style reality  show because she's told it will help with her bigger problem: demonic  possession.
  Negative
Carson, a former top student at a prestigious Catholic high school, does drugs, but because she's literally got a devil inside her, her troubles are beyond her control.Because Carson's not responsible for her actions, that puts the  burden of her treatment and celebrity on everyone but her.

R ather  than question reality TV's obnoxious Blame-Game-enabling tendencies,  "Inner Demons" shames the crew of "Step Inside  Recovery," therehab show that spotlights Carson.So instead of shooting reality TV's fish, the makers of "Inner Demons" just kick the proverbial barrel.
  Very negative
"Inner Demons" belaboredly vilifies Suzanne Kate Whitney, a pushy  producer who repeatedly asks interview subjects to restate candid  answers so that they'll make better soundbites.
  Negative
Professional  interventionist Dean Pretiss Roger Wilkinson and privacy-invading  cameraman Tim Brian Flaberty are also blamed, but they're not as big a  target as Suzanne, who at one point bleats " We're all whores! "
  Negative
Who else bears blame for Carson's plight?

  Negative
The most sympathetic characters in "Inner Demons" are Carson, who has  ulterior reasons for taking drugs, and hapless cameraman Jason Morgan  McClellan, a nice guy with a mean job.
  Negative
He  commiserates with Carson, who mewls that he's the only one that believes  she needs a priest, not a doctor.

  Negative
Carson admits to crushing on him during a pseudo-confessional  interview, sheepishly wishing he could have known her back when she did  innocent things like hang out at the mall.
  Negative
At no point does Carson  question that, at some point, Jason thought shooting her painful  recovery for a reality TV show was an acceptable gig.
  Negative
He's an ostensibly  nice, thoughtful guy, as we see in the scene where he challenges Dr.  Kordis by rhetorically asking him why detox isn't helping Carson with  her Lucifer-related issues.
  Positive
The film's toothless satire is periodically  interrupted by derivative scare scenes, usually presented as  security-camera footage of Carson's demon wigging out.
  Negative
You can  tell that the Satanic monkey on Carson's back is going to do something  violent whenever static and white noise interrupt the film's seamless  faux-documentary appearance.
  Negative
You'll never wonder when Carson's  supernatural tormentor will appear, and will therefore can never be scared  of it.
  Negative
Pity Carson, but blame her creators for turning her into the least  frightening monster this side of "The Real Housewives of New Jersey."
