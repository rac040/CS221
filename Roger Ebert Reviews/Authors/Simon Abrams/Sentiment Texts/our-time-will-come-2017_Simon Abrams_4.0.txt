"Our Time Will Come," a new WWII drama set in Japan-occupied Hong Kong, is a surprisingly affecting call to arms.
  Positive
The characters in this film are defined by motives that are small enough to be relateable and actions that are big enough to be inspiring.This movie is also the kind of historical fiction that used to be dismissed as "middlebrow," and "uncontroversial" when films of its type were championed by Miramax in the 's.
  Negative
"Our Time Will Come" is getting a relatively modest theatrical release thanks to the good folks at China Lion.
  Positive
But it has a low-key urgency that makes it one of the month's most essential theatrical releases.
  Positive
Directed by  Ann Hui " A Simple Life," "The Postmodern Life of My Aunt", "Our Time Will Come" often seems to concern the sudden and unexpected ways that politics define the every-day lives of Communist-sympathizing citizens, like reserved teacher Lan Fong  Zhou Xun and her equally demure mother  Deanie Ip.
  Negative
Yes, Fong and her daughter are portrayed admiringly by Hui and screenwriter Kei-ping Ho for their commitment to fighting imperialism at home.
  Negative
But almost every interaction these characters make is undercut by necessity or skepticism.
  Negative
Resources are scarce, and allegiances are routinely tested because everything in  is political, and therefore impersonal after a point.
  Negative
This is an unsentimental war movie about characters who are forced to consider and live with the consequences of theiractions.
  Negative
"Our Time Will Come" begins as a spy thriller of sorts.
  Negative
The Fongs are, unbeknownst to them,leasing an apartment to a subversive writer who goes by the pen name of Mao Tun  Guo Tao.
  Negative
They only learn of their tenant's double life on the day that Chinese guerillas aid Mao in fleeing the country.
  Neutral
We get vital context that the Fongs don't, like scenes where the guerillas plot a mass evacuation of dissident Chinese intellectuals, and bully a greedy local bandit into letting them pass through his territory.
  Very negative
But the war's influence on the Fongs' lives is not as comprehensible or neat.
  Negative
Mrs. Fong finds a dead Japanese spy's body on her front door.
  Negative
Lan's first-hand knowledge of the Communists comes from her boyfriend Gam-wing  Wallace Huo, a Communist guerrilla who unsuccessfully proposes marriage, and then flees on a mission.
  Negative
Lan is suspicious of her lover, and asks him why he wants to be engaged to her if he's leaving.
  Negative
Eventually Lan joins Gam-wing in fighting the Japanese by spreading propaganda and looking after Communist sympathizers.
  Negative
And even Mrs. Fong, after vocally protesting to her daughter,helps her neighbors and offers to share her food with her daughter's colleagues.
  Positive
Many of the interactions that determine and guide people's principles in "Our Time Will Come" are strictly transactional.
  Negative
People act out ideology for selfish or petty reasons, like the tyrannical Japanese soldier who tests a group of guerrillas' cover stories by sticking a bayonet in the belly of their "dead father" actually the corpse of a Japanese spy that they encounter.
  Negative
The film's villains are, in this way, easily understandable in their lust to maintain power, like the Japanese-sympathizing Indian soldiers who discover a Communist plot when they frisk an old Chinese woman to see if she's hiding money.
  Positive
Hui and Ho even find ways tohumanize Lan's character-defining optimism.
  Negative
Laneventually resolves to help the guerrillas because she's intoxicated by the suspense and romance of passing out leaflets and making a difference.
  Positive
She is almost never just a propaganda-spouting hero, though she does chide her mother when Mrs. Fong insists that one person cannot make a difference.
  Negative
Lan knows than a gesture as innocent-seeming as a shared meal is never so unassuming during wartime.
  Neutral
And when things go wrong, she questions her actions.
  Negative
The drama in "Our Time Will Come" is consistently measured and thoughtful.
  Positive
Every exchange feels like it's stripped down to basic motives and sentiments, and is rarely recast through the rose-colored glasses of revisionism.
  Negative
This is true even in a comparatively saccharine-y action scene where two guerrillas are fired upon by Japanese soldiers in slow-motion.
  Negative
The hail of bullets looks a lot like a swarm offireflies.
  Negative
but even in this unbelievable moment, Hui and Ho try to get you toappreciate the difficulty of doing what you think is the right thing simply by acknowledging thatpolitical action can, in the moment, feel thrilling.
  Negative
Scenes like this may add emotional complexity to a film that often threatens, but never actually becomes, too dry or stuffy for its own good.
  Negative
I love "Our Time Will Come" for the way its' creators represent how hard it is to live out your beliefs.
  Negative
Characters commit to their respectivecauses for their own private reasons.
  Neutral
Their commitments sow an air of mistrust, and tetchiness that Hui and Hoacknowledge throughout the film's relatively fast-moving -minute running time.
  Positive
There are spies and allies everywhere, and the person who extends a hand to a character in one scene might not seem as altruistic in the next.
  Negative
But in addition to the threat of reprisal, there is also joy in camaraderie that comes from throwing yourself into a cause.
  Positive
Here's a film that suggests that we cannot afford to stand idly by while our neighbors and loved ones need our help.
  Neutral
It's also a movie that understands the false comfort and high risks that people assume simply by doing nothing.
  Negative
"Our Time Will Come" is a welcome reminder that, while life eventually goes on with or without our political contributions,we don't get to survive long enough to remember the past if we don't protect each other now.
  Positive
