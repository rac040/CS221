In the new war documentary "Point and Shoot," filmmaker  Marshall Curry  provokes viewers with a loaded question: did Matt Van Dyke do the right  thing?
  Negative
Van Dyke is an American civilian who set out to document his  backpacking adventures across Africa, and wound up becoming a symbol of  the Libyan revolt against Muammar Gaddafi's oppressive regime.
  Negative
Curry  periodically reminds viewers that he's at least a smidge skeptical of  Van Dyke by tentatively questioning his motives, like when he asks Van  Dyke what he thinks of people who will say he should have fled Libya  after being imprisoned by Gaddafi loyalists for six months.
  Negative
But more  often than not, Curry doesn't give us much to judge his subject by  beyond anecdotal details and non-committal introspection.
  Negative
Van  Dyke explains that his travels through Libya were a way of refashioning  himself as a rugged adventurer.
  Negative
"Everyone creates their idealized image  of how they want to be seen," he demurs.
  Positive
This is an inherently  troubling position to take, since real-life violence isn't the same  thing as the "Sid Meier's Civilization" computer games we see Van Dyke  playing.
  Very negative
Van Dyke acknowledges that by stubbornly qualifying some of his  more incredible assertions, like when he defensively adds "I cannot  imagine staying at home, watching my friends being killed" after  insisting that "the Arab spring...challenged what I knew was to be a  man."
  Negative
Curry gently guides Van Dyke's narrative throughout "Point  and Shoot,"  asking him to think about where his pre-revolutionary ideas of heroism  came from, and why he chose to pick up arms, and fight.
  Negative
But he's usually  so obsessed with establishing the broad structure of Van  Dyke's self-made man narrative that he rarely takes time to flesh out  its more tantalizing details.
  Negative
For example, we don't really know why Van  Dyke renames himself "Max Hunter," or why he describes his Hunter  persona as a "swaggering, egotistical" counterpoint  to his usual anxious, meek self.
  Negative
Moreover, while Van Dyke  characterizes his  pre-Libya personality through anxieties, we don't learn what motivated  them.
  Negative
This is partly because he suffers from at least one  Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.
  Neutral
Van Dyke is not only highly germophobic,  but  also perpetually fearful of hurting other people.
  Negative
Curry doesn't press  Van Dyke on this last point, preferring instead to focus on the fact  that Van Dyke wanted to conquer his fears by documenting his journey  across Africa with a video camera mounted on his motorcycle helmet.
  Negative
So  Van Dyke tells us of his interest in " Lawrence of Arabia," but not what  he loves about that film.
  Negative
He also doesn't explain how, practically  speaking, a seriously anxious person trains himself to live in "utterly  filthy" hotels, to shoot guns, and to pal around with revolutionaries  who constantly tease him about his outsider status.
  Negative
"Point and  Shoot"  consequently feels like a film made by a storyteller not a  journalist who doesn't know he can ask follow-up questions.
  Negative
Curry  understandably doesn't judge Van Dyke so harshly that his status  as a tourist looking for self-esteem ever seems malicious.
  Negative
But he also  doesn't mine enough experiential details from his subject to explain his   transformation into the second coming of John Rambo.
  Negative
So while Van Dyke  insists that he has a deep sense of respect to the friends he made while  growing a wicked beard and fighting for his life, it's impossible to  know what he's feeling when one of his comrades jokes that he'll send  Van Dyke's body home in a posh coffin, as a "nice souvenir" for his  mother.
  Negative
Even the moviemaking-as-self-fashioning angle that Curry  leans hard on throughout "Point and Shoot" is underdeveloped.
  Negative
Curry  uses his talking head interview footage to  simplistically create a  pattern that unites Van Dyke's first impression of Gibraltar "It was  very picturesque...it was how I would have imagined it in a  script" with American soldiers' requests to be filmed posing heroically  with their guns, and best tough guy glares.
  Negative
But Curry doesn't get his  subject to explain why he thinks these requests are just soldiers asking  for Facebook post-ready clips of them doing what they do, or why he told  his Libyan allies that he wanted to be more than "just a cameraman,"  insisting that, as one ally puts it, he be a soldier with "two full  hands: guns and camera."
  Negative
Since "Point and Shoot" isn't a  political documentary, but rather a narrative about stories, Van Dyke's  memories of imprisonment are especially disappointing.
  Negative
This scene should  feel revelatory since, as he says, "It absolutely transformed me."
  Positive
But  these scenes, represented through imagistic animated flashbacks, aren't  especially moving.
  Negative
They suggest a stir of emotions without evoking them,  emphasizing POV shots of disembodied hands, and the night sky as seen  through Van Dyke's pinhole-sized air hole.
  Negative
Curry's not patient enough to  get inside his subject's head, so "Point and Shoot" often feels as  rushed as its title implies.
  Negative
