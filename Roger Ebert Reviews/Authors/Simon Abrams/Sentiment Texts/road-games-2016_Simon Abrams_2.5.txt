If you, like me, are a cult film aficionado, you might work yourself into an unnecessary dither upon seeing a new psychological thriller about hitchhikers with the title "RoadGames."
  Negative
If this movie title means nothing to you, do not panic.
  Negative
Heck, you should take deep breaths through your mouth even if you do worship the superb  Hitchcock homage of the same name starring  Stacy Keach and  Jamie Lee Curtis.
  Positive
The new "RoadGames," writerdirector Abner Pastoll's sophomore feature, has very little to do with the earlier movie of the same name.
  Negative
This film's title is just an artful tip of the cap to a primary influence.
  Positive
Pastoll's project is, unlike many contemporary indie thrillers, genuinely moody in parts sinceit was filmed by people who want to put you on edge just by focusing on desolate back roads, creaking floorboards, and circuitous conversations.
  Negative
So yes, you can enjoy "RoadGames" even if you aren't a gorehound.
  Positive
I wish I could recommend "RoadGames" beyond that though, since allroadslead to a twist ending that you can kinda-sorta make outfrom a mile off.
  Negative
By preferring to keep viewers in suspense until the film's finale, Pastoll makes it harder to recommend a movie that has many good ideas, but no clue what to do withthem.
  Negative
Later in his film, Pastoll helps viewers understand what they just saw by naming a never-seen character after  Claude Chabrol, the master French filmmaker whose singularly playful thrillers include " Le Boucher" and "Le Beau Serge."
  Negative
By winking at cinephiles in this way, Pastoll encourages us to revel in his characters' conspicuous attempts at misdirection.
  Negative
You're supposed tofeel like you are kinda-sorta in on these characters' schemes, even if you really aren't.
  Negative
So hold onto your initial misgivings about good guy hitchhiker Jack  Andrew Simpson and mysterious companion Vronique Josphine de La Baume:that slight prickling of discomfort you get around these characters is intentional.
  Neutral
Or at least, that's how you're meant to enjoy watching the main part of "RoadGames."
  Neutral
There are two narrative layers at work here: astraight-forward serial-killer plot, and Jack and Vronique's not-so-subtly hidden backstories.
  Negative
The plot focuses on interplay between Jack, Vronique, and creepy motorist Grizard  Frdric Pierrot, a brutish Frenchman who picks our weary travelers up, and gives them very little reason to trust him.
  Negative
I mean, look at this guy: his unkempt hair, and squat mongoloid build scream, "Frustrated alpha-male artistserial-killerDairy Queen employee in training."
  Negative
What's Grizard hiding?
  Neutral
How is terrified wife Mary scream queen  Barbara Crampton!
  Negative
involved?
  Neutral
And where do they keep the bodies?
  Neutral
But Ben and Vronique's respective lives before the road trip are the crux of Pastoll's promising old-school thriller.
  Positive
This part of the film is crucial.
  Neutral
For starters, you have to buy that this young couple have romantic chemistry, and Simpson sadly can't keep up with de La Baume.
  Negative
Pastoll also sometimes doesn't seem to know how to get the most out of de La Baume's withdrawn performance.
  Negative
As a result, sparks do not fly when these characters flirt with each other, though their body parts are filmed well during a genuinely sexy sex scene.
  Negative
More importantly: Pastoll treats hints about his characters' past as if they were the only card up his sleeve.
  Negative
That's a problem since we, as viewers, should be lost in frustrated banter between Grizard and Jack, or Jack and Vronique.
  Negative
Conversation is the thing, and so much dialogue stops and starts with tidbit-sized cluesred herrings, like when Vronique talks about practicing her signature, or Ben mentions his cheating ex-girlfriend.
  Negative
These little moments shouldn't be too obvious since that would detract from the film's main plot.
  Negative
But realistically, they're the soul of the film, especially given how rote the rest of the plot is.
  Positive
If you like horror films, or thrillers, you've probably heard this one before: a guy and girl fall in love, get terrorized by a creepy foreigner, mustescape.
  Negative
Big deal, so what?
  Neutral
Well, I don't know, actually.
  Negative
I want to commend Pastoll for telling a thrice-told tale with style and doing it in such an inviting way that I sometimes got lost waiting for the proverbial other shoe to drop.
  Negative
But then the climax of "RoadGames" comes to mind, and that pretty much ruins the rest of the movie.
  Very negative
What to do with a mood piece whose creators inadvertently put so much weight on the finale, and then can'tdeliver a satisfying resolution?
  Neutral
I don't know if I can recommend "RoadGames."
  Negative
Moviegoers should check it out if they're curious since it does stand apart from other contemporary thrillers.
  Negative
But "recommend" is probably too strong a word.
  Negative
I want to see what Pastoll does next, and hope people give him that opportunity by seeing "RoadGames."
  Positive
But I can't honestly say I enjoyed Pastoll's breakthrough film beyond that.
  Positive
You should know what generic perils await you before watching this one.
  Negative
It's not as tricky as it should be, but it is appropriately tantalizing.
  Neutral
