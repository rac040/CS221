FrenchJapanese fable "TheRed Turtle" is one of those rare animated movies that transports you to a different setting without demanding that you focus on narrative or character development.
  Positive
Instead, viewers are encouraged to fall in love with an environment, specifically a small tropical island on which a nondescript, mute castaway inexplicably finds himself shipwrecked.
  Negative
This focus on setting over narrative is crucial since "TheRed Turtle" follows the normalization of one man's romance with nature.
  Negative
Because this is a fable, the above-mentioned romance is quite literal: our nameless castaway falls in love with a shapeshiftingturtlethat transforms into a beautiful naked woman.
  Positive
He also inevitably stops trying to escape his surroundings, and starts to build a home on the island.
  Negative
That may sound like a major spoiler, but "TheRed Turtle" is a mood piece for children, so plot twists don't really matter.
  Neutral
The film, which was produced by Japanese animation studio Studio Ghibli, has an intricately-articulated, and confidently-utilized hand-drawn style that lures you in, and makes you want to accept such a blunt, bleeding-heart metaphor for ecological awareness.
  Positive
"TheRed Turtle" begins as a "Robinson Crusoe"-style man vs. nature-style narrative, a mode that viewers should be comfortable andor familiar with.
  Positive
You know this story: a man arrives on an island and must, through sheer force of conviction and ingenuity, rescue himself by creating shelter, foraging for food, and building a raft to escape.
  Positive
The main difference between this type of story and the one that "TheRed Turtle" eventually becomes is that there's always something that's entreating or trying to catch the viewer's eye, whether it's blessedly un-anthropomorophosized crabs, or a forest of gently swaying bamboo shoots.
  Negative
There is subsequently a subtle tension at play at the beginning of the film: the island's personality asserts itself even as we are encouraged to get caught up in our hero's captivating routine of building a raft, trying and repeatedly failing to escape, daydreaming while gazing at the moon, and then inevitably repeating this makeshift procedure.
  Negative
That tension comes to a head once the title character appears.
  Neutral
She is, at first, an invisible, seemingly adversarial presence that stops the film's castaway protagonist from breaking away from his island prison.
  Positive
She destroys his raft, though at first it's hard to tell what's happening since she retreats from view every time he tries to catch a glimpse of her.
  Negative
Still, he is as stubborn as she is, so the castaway tries to build another raft, over and over repeating his process.
  Negative
But eventually, he realizes that there's an observable presence that's out to get him.
  Negative
We join the castaway as he learns that A he's being barred from leaving by a physical presence B that presence is not out to get him and ultimately C that presence is beautiful.
  Negative
Getting from A to B is probably not nearly as difficult a leap in logic for viewers as getting from B to C.
  Negative
But co-writerdirector Michael Dudok de Wit gets viewers to suspend their disbelief by consistently drawing our attention to his film's natural surroundings.
  Positive
This is an enchanted environment, though not in the way you might expect based on Disney cartoons like " The Little Mermaid" or " Peter Pan."
  Neutral
There are some cute animal inhabitants for us to relate to, like the above-mentioned crabs.
  Positive
But for the most part, we are asked to relate to the world through lush details.
  Positive
We experience the overwhelming force of a sudden rainstorm through sound design: rain water pelting bamboo shoots, wind tearing up leaves and tall grass, and normally still waters rippling uncontrollably.
  Very negative
In this way, we adjust to the pace of island life by sharing in the castaway's thrilling process of discovery.
  Negative
So when "TheRed Turtle" eventually becomes a story about a man, a magical reptile-woman, and their life together, it doesn't feel strange.
  Negative
Dudok de Wit successfully teaches viewers to see his two main characters as extensions of the world they inhabit, leading us to see their evolving relationship as an extension of their deepening connection.
  Positive
Or, to put it another way: these two characters care about each other because they eventually realize that they not only aren't enemies, but are two people who happen to share the same world.
  Neutral
There's something amazing about that kind of bond, something that I absolutely did not expect from a children's film: characters growing to like each other and solve problems together based on a mutual appreciation of their surroundings.
  Positive
"TheRed Turtle" also draws viewers in by immersing us in a fully-realized microcosm.
  Negative
Dudok de Wit, co-writer  Pascale Ferran, and an accomplished battalion of animators have created a thoroughly disarming fairy tale, one that initially appears familiar, but eventually reveals itself to be something new, and altogether unexpected.
  Very positive
