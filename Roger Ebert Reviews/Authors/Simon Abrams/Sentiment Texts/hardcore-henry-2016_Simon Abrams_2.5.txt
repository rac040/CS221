Presented almostentirely from thefirst-person perspective of the title hero, "Hardcore Henry"is asensational, feature-lengthbeat-'em-up.Henry, arobotically-enhanced amnesiac who fights a group of mercenaries who have kidnapped Henry's wife Estelle  Haley Bennett, finds variousinventive uses for bricks, knives, grenades, and many guns.
  Negative
But do we really need to experience his kineticadventures in blood-soaked bad taste from his alienating first-person perspective?Short answer: not really, but so what?
  Negative
"Hardcore Henry" is like a good roller-coaster in that itdoes not require a complex reason to be: it's there, it's fun, you ride it, and that's aboutit.
  Very positive
Over-the-top-ness is what draws you into "Hardcore Henry," a film that can be described as a cross between the "Call of Duty" first-person shooter video games, and hyper-violent, semi-satirical actionmovies like "RoboCop" and "Crank."
  Positive
The film lives and diesbased on its abilities todisorient, shock, and generally undermine your sense of stability.So: soon after heis awoken and quickly debriefed by Estelle,Henry ischased out of an airborne laboratory byevil albino businessman Akan Danila Kozlovsky, an ultra-powerful mobboss with theability to move things with his mind.
  Very negative
Henry, a cyborg with a robotic right arm and right leg, then runs around Moscow with the help ofJimmy " District " star Sharlto Copley, a mysterious benefactor who appears through the guise of various clones of himself.
  Negative
Henry's mission is always simple:track down allies and supplies using a cell phone with a GPS, and kick scads of butt along the way.
  Negative
Now, you could argue that "Hardcore Henry" does not go far enough over-the-top to be a truly great midnight movie, something you watch with your friends whenever your mind is most receptive to dark,trippy, andorflat-out bizarre ideas.
  Negative
For example, much of the film concerns the simultaneoushomogenization andprivatization of contemporary Russian security, linking Akan'sall-black mercenarystormtroopers with other private sector employees naked,blonde-wig-wearing prostitutes.
  Negative
Likewise, a third-act twist implicates viewers for wanting to believe something about Henry that is patently untrueirrelevant.
  Negative
But again, notenough is made of this revelation.
  Positive
More importantly: while the action choreography is impressively bombastic, it's alsonot very good.
  Positive
The film's action scenes are likemediocre musical compositions, sporadicallypunched up by a boisterous, ever-mutatingchorus.
  Positive
When Henry moves around, his running, kicking, and punchingoften feels like uninspired build-up for the nextsplashy murder.
  Negative
It's telling that, in a later scene, Queen's "Don't Stop Me Now" starts playing whenHenry takes on an army of Akan's men.By this point in the film, the audience, like Henry,may be ready to check out.
  Negative
But then Freddie Mercury starts singing about how he's having a good time, and he doesn't want to stop at all.
  Negative
Henry then jams two syringes full of adrenaline into his thighs.
  Neutral
And the scene takes off, lurching around without reason or grace beyond a blind imperative to get from one cool-looking kill to the next.
  Negative
If nothing else, this scene proves that the makers of "Hardcore Henry" know exactly what type of film they made.
  Negative
After all, who would ever cast character actorSharlto Copley in multiple parts?
  Neutral
His line readings are wildly uneven here,his emotionalrange non-existent, and he tends to over-emphasize every other line and never in an intuitive way.
  Negative
Then again,the amateurishness of Copley's performance is what makes him such a fascinating screen presence: he steals almost every scene he's in because you never know what he's going to do.
  Positive
He'slike a young Christopher Walken, though Walken wasalways a strong screen presence and performer.
  Positive
Still, there's a lot of Copley in "Hardcore Henry" since Jimmy plays Henry's guide to a video-game-like world of senseless violence.
  Neutral
Ultimately, there's no time or reason to question what motivates actions in "Hardcore Henry," not when almost every scene boils down to action verbs:running, jumping, stabbing, etc.
  Negative
I'm not sure "Hardcore Henry" should exist, but if you pack a Dramamine, and surrender to its pummeling embrace, you'll probably enjoyyourself.
  Negative
