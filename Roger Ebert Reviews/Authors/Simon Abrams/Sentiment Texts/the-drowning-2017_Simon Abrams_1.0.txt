Bad pulp fiction turns readers into what  Alfred Hitchcock called "the plausibles," viewers who pick apart a work of usually pop art simply because it does not hew closely enough to their idea of what real life is like.
  Negative
I became a plausible as I watched"The Drowning," a frustrating mystery andairport-thriller-grade psychologicalpotboiler about psychiatrist Tom Seymour  Josh Charles.
  Negative
Tomtries to treat generically creepy young man Danny Miller  Avan Jogia,aformer patient who probably committed a murder when he was only  years old.
  Negative
Based on a novel by  Pat Barker, "The Drowning" features some of the most gruel-thin justifications for its already flimsyplot machinations.
  Negative
It's an obnoxious story about revenge and self-destruction that throws together a bunch ofhackneyed observations about humanity, and then justifies its laziness by asking us to embrace Tom'sunbelievably forgiving artistwife Lauren  Julia Stiles when she opinesthat people behave irrationally because they are "not bad," but rather "not easy."
  Negative
I wanted to pull the little hair I have left out when Lauren delivers this pseudo-sophisticated truism.
  Neutral
Let's start at the top:I becamea plausible while watching "The Drowning" as soon as Tom agreed to take Danny's case.
  Negative
By this point, theincident from the film'stitle has already occurred: Tom saves an unknown young man from drowning, only to discover that he rescued Danny.
  Negative
This coincidenceisn't that ridiculous when you realize that Danny isobsessed with Tom.But here's where things get unbelievable: despite the fact that Danny tells Tom point-blank that he blames him for delivering a professional opinion that led to Danny's incarceration in a facility for juvenile offenders, Tom gives in to pressure from fellow head-shrinker Angela  Tracie Thoms, and soon acceptsDanny as one of his patients.
  Very negative
Tom doesn't break off contact with Danny after he shows up at his house, and casuallymakes friendswith Lauren.
  Negative
Heck, Tom doesn't even tell Lauren who Danny really is: she just knows Danny as the nice young man that her emotionally distant, but well-meaning husband saved from drowning.
  Negative
At this point, I didn't say "How does this make sense?"
  Negative
Instead, I went straight for "You have got to be kidding me."
  Negative
Oh, sure, characters attempts to address the inherent ridiculousness of Tom's pseudo-soul-searching quest to forgive himself by better understanding Danny.Thomseven deliversa horrendously weak line that's meant to assuage viewers who are asking themselves "Why would Tom agree to be this kid's confessor if he himself isn't sure of the kid's moral character?"
  Negative
She says "Like it or not, you're in this too."
  Neutral
Thisis the kind of sentence that is only sensiblein the world of "Law amp' Order" spin-offs and  James Patterson novels.
  Negative
It's about as bad as the time when Tom, supposedly shaken by the accusations of his more level-headed peers, begs off by saying "I don't know.
  Very negative
I don't know what I think."
  Neutral
Which is not to say that real people don't contort themselves into positions they've become familiar with from pre-existing fiction.
  Negative
On the contrary, Jogia's tic-riddled character and performance is proof that sometimes, people prefer cliched mannerismsto psychological realism.Jogia often talks like  Robert De Niro in Martin Scorsese's " Cape Fear," or any number of post-Hannibal Lecterpsychopathic killers.
  Negative
He speechifies eloquently with a pseudo-probing, pseudo-knowing familiarity that's supposed to keep you wondering where exactly he's going.
  Negative
This, again, is partly the writers', and not theperformer's, fault.
  Negative
But when you have a performer whose one job is to constantly pop up like a sulky Jack-in-the-box, and inexplicably get closer and closer to Tom without any plausible reason?
  Negative
That's when you too will become a plausible, and stop seeing the performer as a victim of youthful bad decisions, and even worsedirection, and start seeing him as a punching bag for all of your frustrations.
  Negative
The film's narrative leads Tom to pretty much exactly where you should expect it to, and climaxes with an act of violence whose sole reason-to-be is to provide a shocking source of relief for anxiousviewers ostensiblyhoping that Tom would stop treatingDanny like a problem to solve.
  Negative
Director  Bette Gordon "Variety," "Handsome Harry" tries to lend some personality to the film's proceedings by shooting many scenes with an attention to silhouettes, and blurry objectsthat seem to disappear around the periphery of Gordon's camera frame.
  Negative
Viewers who dig what the filmmakers are selling might leave the filmfeeling like they've seen Tom evaporate, just like the central visual motif of raindrops on a car windshield that Gordon favors so much shegratuitously interrupts a handful of scenes just to highlight this recurring image.
  Negative
But the problem with "The Drowning" isn't that the characters are insubstantial, but ratherthat they don't dry up and disappear fast enough.
  Negative
