Givinga negative review to elaboratemysterymelodrama "A Bride for Rip Van Winkle" doesn't feel good.
  Negative
Watching the film,I found myself often admiring writerdirector  Shunji Iwai " All About Lily Chou-Chou," "Vampire" for orchestrating an ambitious, and consistently engaging story about a deeply alienated schoolteacher who is repeatedly gas-lit by a creepy, alluring stranger.
  Very positive
I was also sodisturbedby this film thatI felt I had to rewatch certain scenes just to confirm that the emotional exhaustion I experienced while watching itwasn't just a personal preference, but rather a problem I had with what Iwai and his collaborators do in the film.
  Negative
Still, after turning over "A Bride for Rip Van Winkle" a couple of times in my head, and sleeping on it, I must say:theexperience of watching this anti-climactic three-hour drama is unproductivelydepressing, and upsetting.
  Negative
That's partly because Iwai is soinvested inintroducing unexpected plot twists, and reversals of fortune that he never meaningfully expands on the film's seeming fixation with love in the the time of theInformation Age.
  Negative
The best thing I can say about "A Bride for Rip Van Winkle" is thatIwai worked me over thoroughly.
  Negative
Iwai lands hisheaviest body blowsduring his film's first of three hours.
  Negative
At this point, "A Bride for Rip Van Winkle" is a dreary, but mostlycompelling drama about the perils of social media, and role-playing.
  Negative
Painfully shy school teacher Nanami  Haru Kuroki is mercilessly teased by students at work.
  Negative
Her boss doesn't support her, and many of the people in her life, including her family members, talk over her, andor treat her as if she's invisible.
  Positive
So it's not surprising when she meets herfianc Tetsuya  G Jibiki through Planet, a lesser-knownsocial media website.
  Negative
Or that, when Tetsuya pressures her to invite more family and friends to their wedding, she feels deeply embarrassed.
  Neutral
What is surprising is the rapidity with whichNanami finds and becomes attached to Amuro G Ayano, a shady "fixer"-type factotum who helps Nanami with her wedding predicament by hiringactors to pretend to be her family and friends.
  Negative
Nanami and Amuro's discomfiting relationship gets even moreunsettlingright after that: she discovers a pair of women'searrings in her bedroom, and consequently paysAmuro to observe Tetsuya, and confirmher suspicions of infidelity.
  Negative
But Amuro, as we soon find out,is responsible fora vastconspiracyto separate Nanami from Tetsuya.Nanami and Amuro's friendship onlygetweirder, and creepier after this, though it's unclear why.
  Negative
I found it difficult to get through this first part of "A Bride for Rip Van Winkle," which reminded me of thesameunnervingcynicism that defines many of the best films of provocativearthouse dramatists like Lars von Trier,  Michael Haneke, and even  Sion Sono.
  Negative
But I found itharder still to progress past this point.We are, early on, gifted with a revelation that Nanami never receives: Amuro is playing with her, and every major event in her life after she meets Tetsuya is, in some way, orchestrated, or overseen by Amuro.
  Negative
ButNanami never seems aware, or interested in the myriad little coincidences, and odd changes in her life.
  Negative
What does she think about the fact that her circle of friends shrinks until it only include speople that Amuro introduces her to?
  Neutral
How does she feel when she winds up living in a hotel because of his actions?
  Neutral
Andwhy doesn't she stop herself from becoming dependent on him for work, and companionship?
  Negative
The answer to all of these questions seems to be a matter of perspective.
  Neutral
Maybe Amuro is the personification of the shadowy, inescapable role that social media nowplays in many of our lives.
  Neutral
I guess he's like Facebook or Twitter in that he alsoencourages randomacts ofrole-playing, and instantlynormalizes alienation for the sake of greater social freedom.
  Negative
But no, wait, hang on: why then isn't Nanami's dependence on him the focus of the film?
  Negative
What exactly does it say about Nanami that she just gives so much of herself away without any consequences, or sign of introspective concern, or failure?And why, if this film is intended to be viewed as an allegory,does everything look soflat, and color-less?
  Negative
What doesIwai's mix of "mundane" style, and allegorical content actually say, or accomplish?
  Negative
I left "A Bride for Rip Van Winkle" feeling likea group of talented filmmakers had taken advantage of me.Iwai's vision is so hyper-specific that I didn't recognize any truth, or reality in it.
  Negative
I am certain ofa couple things though.
  Negative
I know thatthis movie made me feel bad.
  Negative
I suspectit's not a film I'm going to forget any time soon.
  Negative
And I fear that, every time I want to get closer to its mysteries, I'll realize that there's not much more to what's going on beyond its lavishly constructed, but substantially bewildering narrative.
  Negative
Nanami loses herself more and more as "A Bride of Rip Van Winkle" unfolds.
  Negative
You might alsowant to take a chance, andfollow her for three hours.
  Negative
But I cant really recommend the experience.
  Very positive
