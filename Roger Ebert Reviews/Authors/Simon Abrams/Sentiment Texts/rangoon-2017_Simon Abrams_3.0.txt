Indian melodrama"Rangoon" somehow manages to be emotionally resonant despite being overstuffed.
  Positive
This is no small feat given how many different genres, tones, and characters this film juggles.
  Negative
"Rangoon" is, among other things, a politically naiveWWII drama,an infectious putting-on-a-show musical complete with accomplished song and dance numbers, and a soapy menage-a-troisromance between an actress, a director, and a soldier.
  Positive
It is immodestly scaled and frequently implausible but manages to be fargreater than the sum of its parts.
  Negative
"Rangoon" is also that rare Indian film I can recommend to anyone who isn't necessarily already interested in Bollywood or Hindi-language cinema despite its myriad little flaws, it's a charmingcrowd pleaser.
  Positive
Directed and co-written by  Vishal Bhardwaj IndianShakespeare adaptations "Maqbool," "Omkara" and "Haider", "Rangoon" is a movie that does not make significantpolitical or narrative sense since it's essentially a big bowl of cinematic Neapolitan ice cream, except all three flavors are mixed together before-the-fact.
  Negative
Events kick off with a brief and oversimplifiedhistorical primer on the Indian National Army INA and its drive to take India back from theBritishby joining the Japanese in their fight against the Allies.
  Negative
The INA isnot accorded much political importance by their Japanese allies, so they're forced to fight the Brits through counter-intelligence and espionage.
  Negative
But there are Indiansoldiers, like Nawab Malik Shahid Kapoor, fighting the Japanese as well.
  Negative
These guys arealso essentiallyexpendable, as we see when Nawab is immediately captured by Japanese soldiers after his fellow soldiers abandon him.
  Negative
Meanwhile, a stunt-woman and movie star named Julia  Kangana Ranaut has been tasked by her filmmaker paramour Rustom "Rusi" Billimoria  Saif Ali Khan with entertaining British troops in Burma.
  Negative
Rusi has a stump for a right hand and an unhappy, financially independent wife.
  Positive
But he's not just a cad: Rusi is a Britishcollaborator who makes deals whenever he knows he can't get away without them.
  Negative
Thistrait is one that Rusi willeventually be disabused of, making him the strongest character in "Rangoon."
  Positive
But in the beginning he's just an emotionally unavailable tycoon who treats his mistress Julia like a pawn, and accordingly fails to anticipate that somebody else like Nawab, who serves asJulia's bodyguard during her tour of Burma might win her over if he doesn't act fast.
  Negative
Nawab is probably the weakest of the film's three characters since his inner life is taken for granted.
  Negative
There's a portion of "Rangoon" where he takes center stage, though, and it plays out a bit like " The Bodyguard" meets "Rambo: First Blood Part II."
  Negative
Nawab and Julia bond after they're separated from the British army, and must fend for themselves for several days, searching for food and shelter in Japanese bunkers and bombed-outBurmese villages.
  Negative
This section of the film is a bitcreaky, but it's ultimately effective because it establishes Nawab as a sympathetic man of action who cares about prisoners of war.
  Positive
It also features a genuinely sexy moment between Khan and Ranaut: Nawab takes his time examining her naked back for leeches, uncovering a scar just over her hips.
  Positive
"Rangoon" loses a bit of itsnarrative simplicity once Nawab and Julia return to the British camp, and the film gravitates towards Rusi.
  Negative
This wouldn't be such a bad thing if Rusi wasn't, for most of the film's second half, such a genericjealous lover.
  Negative
He flies into a tizzy when he notices Nawab and Julia'sfurtive glances and not-so-secret rendezvous, though it takes some time before he decides to act on his feelings.
  Negative
The film uses Rusi, Julia and Nawab's love triangle to examine a divided country's conflicted feelings about being subjugated by foreign powers.
  Positive
Julia resents Rusi's insistence that she is his creation, while Rusi grows to dislike being told what to do by cartoonishly evil British General Harding  Richard McCabe.
  Positive
Nawab, a British POW forced to fight against his fellow countrymen, has his own baggage, but it's hard to get into that without giving away a key plot point.
  Negative
The most remarkable thing about "Rangoon" isn't how seamless its plot mechanics are or how ideologically nuanced it is' it's the movie's determination to foreground its characters and get you to care what happens to them.
  Negative
This is a convincing love story featuring catchy songs and well-choreographed dance numbers, and it features a heroine who isn't just a cliched harpy one minute and ass-kicker the next.
  Positive
"Rangoon" may climax with showy war-movie pyrotechnics and a showdown that leaves more main characters dead than alive, but even that succeeds because Bhardwaj and his co-creators make sure you're invested in the film's ever-escalating stakes.
  Negative
