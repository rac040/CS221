  Negative
OK, fine, only understandablyconfusedmoviegoers will grapple with thelast part of my rhetorical question.
  Negative
Still," Don ' t  Sleep " is onlyof cursoryinterest becauseofthe tough questions that Bieber puts in main characters' mouths, like how can you take responsibility for your actions when even yourfamily and friendsfind them too dark to face?
  Negative
"Don't Sleep"eventually becomes a movieabout a community of well-wishers that help a bright young kid hide from himself.
  Positive
He's compartmentalized a dark past to the point where he, as Bieber ostentatiously points out, can only process the pain of ... something ... by seeing it through jumbled-uphorror movie tropes.
  Negative
What's weird and that much more disappointing about " Don ' t  Sleep " is Zach's not the only onehaunted by his past.
  Very negative
It literally takes a village to create and be moved by Zach's demons, like when a closet door mysteriously pops open whileShawn undresses before taking a shower.

  Neutral
You might think, based on this admittedlyselective plot summary, that you were watching a horror movie about the terror of living with a "nice guy" type, someone who nobody is willing to admit iscapable of hurting the women in his life.

That's aquestion that I sadly don ' t have a snappy retort for. "
  Negative
Don ' t  Sleep " fails on a number of levels, most immediately because it takes too long to figure out whatBieber is saying.
  Negative
There's a hokeytwist ending at the film's end that suggests that Zach isn' t solelyresponsible for his actions, and that even if he were, his problems are universal, and therefore human, and relatable.
  Negative
I'd believe this conciliatoryline ofthought if Bieberconvinced me that he cares enough about his characters to absolve all of them of their sins.
  Negative
There's a lot of moving parts to Zach's story, but I never got the sense that his problems were indicative of anything more than a guilty individual's quest to understand himself better.
  Neutral
By shifting focus to everyone else partly for misdirection's sake Bieber allows us to wonder who is most to blame.
  Positive
This sounds an awful lot like victim-blaming, a notion that is impossible to stomach in a movie where there's all sorts of unchallenged acknowledgments of the fact that Shawn's beauty and patience is essentially a sign of his superficiallytrouble-free dream life.
  Negative
Timmy even jokesthree times about wantingto make it with Shawn.
  Neutral

  Negative
But I can' t recommend this movie, mostly because it's not smart enough to deserve that praise.

Don ' t  Sleep " could have been a great horror movie.
  Positive
Too bad a great topic does not necessarily make a great film.
