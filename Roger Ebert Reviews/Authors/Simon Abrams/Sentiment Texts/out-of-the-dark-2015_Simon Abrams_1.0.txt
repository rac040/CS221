"Out of the Dark," a ghost story about four white people who are haunted by dead Colombian children, strings together horror movie tropes that were previously used to greater effect in recent horror films like " The Orphanage," " The Others," and the  remake of " Don't Be Afraid of the Dark."
  Negative
Those recent movies stood out thanks to their abundant atmosphere, sturdy, psychologically-realistic characterizations, and clever direction.
  Very positive
By contrast, "Out of the Dark" never leaves much of an impression despite character actor Stephen Rea's endearingly cocky performance, and an exotic   though largely under-utilized   South American setting.
  Negative
While the film's supernatural plot is generic enough to be potentially decent, it does require viewers to suspend their disbelief long enough to be conceptually thoughtful.
  Negative
Married couple Paul and Sarah Harriman  Scott Speedman and  Julia Stiles move into Contreras's Santa Clara estate along with their young daughter Hannah  Pixie Davies.Paul and Sarah have inherited a haunted house from Jordan Rea, Sarah's father and the owner of a local paper mill.
  Negative
But Sarah and Paul reconsider Jordan's gift after Hannah is persistently harassed by vindictive ghost children.
  Negative
Eventually, several pointlessly contrived plot points bog down the film's otherwise completely acceptable scenario.
  Negative
For example, Hannah is abducted by the above-mentioned ghost children, but not because she's left without adult supervision.
  Negative
No, while Hannah chases her stuffed animal into a dumbwaiter, her babysitter Catalina Vanesa Tamayo is distracted by a red ball.
  Neutral
The fact that Catalina, a thinly-drawn character who only exists to care for Hannah, is taken away from Hannah by a possessed rubber ball isn't the lamest idea in a horror film, but that kind of lame red herring becomes a minor point of fascination since the rest of the film isn't moody enough to keep you focused on connecting the film's schematic dots.
  Very negative
This brings us to the biggest problem with "Out of the Dark:" it's not even immediately involving.
  Negative
For starters, the film's cast is drastically uneven.
  Negative
While Rea is charming, and restrained, both Stiles and Speedman are completely forgettable.
  Negative
Davies is cute enough, she understandably doesn't have much range beyond pouting, and smiling.
  Positive
Spanish director Lluis Quilez doesn't take enough time to show us what his characters are feeling, or how their bodies move in relation to each other.
  Negative
He also doesn't film any of his actors with proper lighting, preferring a murky, brownish-black palette that makes the title of "Out of the Dark" seem like wishful thinking.
  Negative
Without compelling characters, worthwhile performances, or superficially arresting aesthetic pleasures, the only thing of interest in "Out of the Dark" is its thematic concern with suppressed third-world citizens.
  Positive
The ghosts that haunt the Harrimans are just ciphers, poorly-defined spirits who want their deaths to be noticed andor avenged.
  Negative
That revanchist trend is a trite, but satisfying impulse that doesn't work here given how simultaneously drawn-out and un-nuanced the film's central power dynamic is' the Harrimans bring to light what a barely present group of locals either don't remember or don't seem to care about.
  Negative
There's only one compelling scene in "Out of the Dark" that hints at greater depth, but it's far too short, and only teases us with ideas that are never developed.
  Very negative
In this early sequence, Paul is driven from the airport with his family in Jordan's car.
  Positive
Two young beggars approach the car.
  Neutral
Paul tries to lower his window so he can give the two gaunt children some money, but his driver locks Paul's window for him.
  Negative
Paul protests, but is ignored, and the car speeds away.
  Negative
Ignoring the locals is business as usual in Jordan's world, a taboo topic that nobody broaches.
  Negative
If only there were more where that came from.
  Neutral
