When you start watching "One More Time with Feeling," you are suddenly dropped into the eye ofa creative storm that beganafterthe death of  Arthur Cave, one of Australian rocker Nick Cave's two sons.
  Positive
This deeply moving concert doc concerns that loss, but only indirectly.
  Positive
We join Cavebeforethe release of Skeleton Tree, his latest album with decades-oldband The Bad Seeds.
  Negative
But by the time director  Andrew Dominikfilms Cave using aD cameraand anadvanced black-and-white D camera and his band in their Brighton recording studio,it seems as if the bulk of Cave and his band's creative decisions have been made.
  Negative
Still, anxiety permeates the studio: how will people receive Skeleton Tree, a characteristically intimate, but highly conceptualalbum that onlyaddresses personal loss in the abstract?
  Positive
Dominikdirector of " Killing Them Softly," " The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford" tries to preserve Cave'suncertainty by presenting Cave's studio recordings as a mix of polished concert footage and off-the-cuff interview footage that reveals Cave's tortured headspace.
  Negative
Cave tellsDominik that Arthur's death has obstructed his creative process by making him feel adrift.Dominik tries to illustrate the"elastic" interminable present moment that Cave is experiencing by conflating time and space during recording sessions.
  Negative
"One More Time with Feeling" is a uniquely cinematic documentary, one that actively blurs the line between fact and fiction.
  Positive
Sometimes Dominik's D camera drifts through solid surfaces, including people, doors and walls.
  Positive
Sometimes it snakes around Cave while D videographers film Dominik at work.
  Negative
Once or twice, voiceover narration of Cave's innermost thoughts recorded after the events filmed give us a hyper-real window into his thought process.
  Negative
This isn't really a movie about creativity, though it is that, after a fashion.
  Negative
Instead, this is a movie about the pause before the end of a creative obstacle.
  Positive
We join Cavemoments justafter he's decidedto continue struggling without his son.
  Negative
Arthur's death still weighs on him, as it would any parent.
  Negative
But Skeleton Treeis now out in the world, and cannot be contained by Cave's subconscious.
  Negative
I hesitate to credit Cave's subconscious with having done the heavy-lifting on Skeleton Treesince he himself seems unsure from where his newest album's songs came.
  Negative
He talks about "Gods" and "accidents," and repeatedly talks about God andhis bandmates in the same breath.
  Negative
Like the late Leonard Cohen's music anacknowledged influence on Cave's style Cave seeks answers to spiritual questions for which he suspects he alreadyknows the answers.
  Negative
He is his own God because he is, as he tells Dominik when he readslyrics to as-yet-unreleased songs, different than the universe since he has"consciousness."
  Negative
Cave's art is a struggle to paradoxically honor and resisthis consciousness' needto make sense of the world.
  Positive
When Dominik asks why Cave's recent music isn't driven by narratives, the musician responds, "Real life isn't like that."
  Negative
But art can be, Dominik argues, by creating a beautifully unhingedsnapshotof Cave just after he experiences a major personal loss and a minorcreative epiphany.
  Negative
Dominik's film owes a great deal to experimental filmmaking techniques that  Jean-Luc Godard used in the Rolling Stones not-quite-doc "Sympathy for the Devil" and avant gardemusical "A Woman is a Woman."
  Neutral
In those films, Godard constantly deconstructs the narratives he employsas a means of provocatively suggesting that language can only fitfully express trulyprofoundmeaningrevolutionary thoughtssublimejoy.
  Negative
Dominik's film is similarly about Cave's need to express himself without sounding trite or platitudinous.
  Neutral
He does not want to escape from Arthur's death, but he also hesitantly tells Dominik, during incisive interview footage, that hedoesn't want to commemorate his son through sentimental truisms, like "he livesin our hearts," a saying he spits out because "Arthurdoesn't live at all."
  Very negative
Cave adds that he chooses his words very carefully because he doesn't want to be trapped by thebrittleimages that his words directly conjure.
  Positive
Dominik responds in kind by filming himselfstruggling and often succeeding at giving dimension and shape to Cave's grief.
  Negative
Nothing can give shape or closure to Cave and that's OK.
  Negative
Watching him continue his ongoing search for existentialanswers is comfort enough.
  Positive
