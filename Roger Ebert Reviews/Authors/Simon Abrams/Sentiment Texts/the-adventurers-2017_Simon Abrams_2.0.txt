Is Hong Kong action-adventure "The Adventurers" that bad, or is leading man  Andy Laujust not as charming as he used to be?
  Negative
In America,Lau is probablymostwell-known as the star of " Infernal Affairs," the milestone Hong Kong undercover cop thriller that was later remade as " The Departed."
  Negative
But in Asia,Lau has enjoyedmore than three decades in the spotlight, and rightfully so.
  Negative
This guy is so slick that he somehow maintainedhis suavitude even after he, afterperforming ahitlove ballad called "Toilet Bowl" during his time as a Mando-pop musician,served asspokesperson for the Ho Cheng Group toilet company.
  Negative
Just imagine: Lau'sface was on stickers plastered in or around urinals in Taiwan, China, and Hong Kong and he still looked smooth!Unfortunately,Lau just isn't charming enough to carry the utterly forgettable "The Adventurers," a tepid remake of John Woo's already lame heist flick "Once a Thief."
  Very negative
"The Adventurers," a sleepy globe-trottingadventure about a retired thief Lau, of course drawn in by the promise of "one last heist," is an underwhelming vanity projectLau also produced the film.
  Negative
Now  years old, Lau reprisesa role thatYun-Fat Chow originated back in , when Chow was only  years old.The role of Zhang, the cocky, and quietly self-assured ex-con jewelry thief, might seem ideal for Lau.
  Negative
But if "The Adventurers" is any indication, Lau has not aged gracefully.
  Negative
Lau always strains to appear coolin scenes that require an air of effortless yet contained gracefulnessfrom him.
  Negative
This is partly a language barrier problem:Lau exchanges choppyEnglish with co-star  Jean Reno, who plays the obligatorystubbornFrench detective that's hot on Zhang's heels, but always just one step behind.
  Negative
But Lau's also stuck with a wan script, which does not give him many opportunities to charm viewers with his signature smile, or boyish,aw-shucks shoe-gazing.
  Negative
Lau's a star, and you can see it any time that Zhang strides confidently into a room packed with tuxedo and ballroom-gown-clad gamblers andsocialites.
  Positive
But "The Adventurers" is otherwise far too skimpy to be memorable.
  Negative
All we know about Zhang is that he likes money.
  Positive
In fact, he playfully explains his motives for participating in the theft of the priceless three-piece "Gaia" necklace by cutting right to the heart of the matter: "I'm greedy, and I like money."
  Negative
This could have been more than just a throwaway line, but it's not since characters are never treated as anything more than archetype-flat character types.
  Negative
Everything you see in "The Adventurers" is essentially a leftover from earlier heistchase films, right down to the lame John Barry-esque James Bond Lite score, and the uninspired " Thomas Crown Affair"-like set pieces.
  Negative
So it's no wonder that Zhang and colleagues Po Chen Tony Yo-ning Yang, Red  Shu Qi, and Kong "Infernal Affairs" co-star Eric Tsang are never developed beyond their formulaic roles.
  Negative
Po is the young hacker, gutsy, and untrained.
  Positive
Red is the plucky femme fatale, cocky, and mysterious.
  Negative
And Kong is the dad-likefixer, the silent partner that sets everything up, and then promptly disappears.
  Positive
Meanwhile, Jean Reno, as Pierre,huffs and puffs as he trails after Zhang.
  Negative
PoorReno is the saddest case: he's saddled withdismal, uninspired lines like "What are you up to this time" and "You're already too late!"
  Negative
I'd say that this kind of paint-by-numbers scenario should write itself, but you try telling that to director  Stephen Fung "House of Fury," "Tai Chi Hero" and his five credited co-writers.
  Negative
The fact that Lau, Reno, Qi, and their co-stars are stuck with sucha poorly sketched-out narrative wouldn't matter if "The Adventurers" had even a couple of worthwhile set pieces, or some dazzling actionchoreography.
  Very negative
Unfortunately, Fung displays none of the bratty knack for hyper-stylized action scenes that he did in his recent "Tai Chi Zero" and "Tai Chi Hero" films.
  Very negative
Many scenes are over-edited, and generally lack rhythm.
  Negative
You should be on the edge of your seat when Lau walks into a room, pours on the charm, and tricks a room full of already-on-edgeauction attendantsinto leaving in a panic.
  Negative
In fact, watching Lau work should be the main draw of the film since he is normally rather charming, and up for anything, including commanding roles that required him to be heavily made-up with a cumbersome full-body fat suit "Love on a Diet", and a many-abbed muscle suit "Running On Karma".
  Negative
But there isn't even any noteworthy action choreography in the scene here where Lau dangles from a vaulted ceiling, and attempts to defy logic and gravity by lowering himself over a display case guarded by a mess of criss-crossed red lasers.
  Negative
This scene is lifted directly from Woo's original film, and has since been done better by  Brian De Palma in " Mission: Impossible."
  Positive
Why do we need to see it one more time, only now with less feeling?
  Negative
"The Adventurers" leaves viewers wondering whatever happened to Lau, even as they watch him try todesperatelyrecapture the spark ofirrepressible charm that typified his indomitable rise to fame.
  Negative
Lau should take a page from  Tom Cruise and Jackie Chan's "middle-aged prima Donna action star" playbook, and learn what will best flatter himself, be it running real fast, or performingelaborate stuntwork.
  Positive
He may be impossibly fit for any age, but Lau'snot strong enough to claw his way out of this toilet.
  Negative
