"TheBoyandtheBeast," a new Japanese animated fantasy writtenanddirected by mega-talented Japanese filmmaker  Mamoru Hosoda "Summer Wars", will probably enterandexit American theaters in a flash.American distributors Funimation are not marketingthefilm to anyone but established anime fans.
  Negative
After all, Japanese andAsian movies in general aretreated like niche products designed for native language speakersand genre-fetishists only.
  Negative
"TheBoyandtheBeast" won't dent that seemingly unbreakable mold mentality since its plot will probably seem familiar to anyone who enjoys other recent anime, particularly Hayao Miyazaki's " Spirited Away," not to mention classic live-action fantasies like "TheWizard of Oz."
  Negative
But what sets this film apart from its generic predecessors is writerdirector Hosoda's knack for playful set pieces,andunsentimental love of surrogate familial communities.
  Positive
This isn't just a sloppy wet kiss of an animated movie, thoughthefilm does veer towards that conclusion.
  Negative
Instead, "TheBoyandtheBeast" is a visually impressive mix of hand-drawnandCGI animation with basic action-adventure elements that are always viscerally satisfying thanks to Hosoda's apparent warts-and-all love for humanity.
  Positive
Hosoda's action-adventure is, as its title implies, a story about aboy.
  Positive
That's important sincethefilm's perspective namely its mistrust of authority figures, quasi-bro-y camraderie,andyes, juvenile clumsiness around women is informed bythegender of hot-head hero Ren  Aoi Miyazaki, no relation to Hayao.
  Negative
Ren is nine years old when his distant relatives try to take him into their custody.
  Negative
His mother has died in a sudden accident,andhis father has not been contacted heandRen's mother divorced.Ren is so angry that he runs away,andis almost immediately abducted by Kumatetsu  Koji Yakusho, ahumanoid bear-monster who lives in Jutengai, a fantasticworldruled by anthropomorphized animals.
  Very negative
Kumatetsu,theundisciplined heir to Jutengai's throne, needs an apprentice in order to prove himself to Jutengai's enigmatic current ruler a bunny-man with white, navel-long whiskers.
  Negative
So Ren is made to help Kumatetsu defeat his holier-than-thou rival Iozan Kazuhiro Yamaji.
  Negative
One ofthemore eccentric aspects of this story is that it doesn't simplistically conflate RenandKumatetsu's respective needs.
  Negative
Helping Kumatetsu out doesn't automatically confer life-changingcharacter-building wisdom to Ren.
  Negative
Instead, it gives himthecourage to infrequently check out of Kumatetsu's story,andforge his own path.
  Negative
"TheBoyandtheBeast" is, in that sense, a bifurcated narrative with two overlappingplot threads.Thefirst thread is about Kumatetsu,andwhat Ren tries to "assimilate" from him.Theother thread begins when Ren learns he can return to his world: he develops a romance with bookworm Kaede  Suzu Hirose while trying to bond with his estranged father.
  Negative
In Ren's first story, Kumatetsu is treated like a surrogate father,someone whose story plays a vital part in Ren's growth.
  Negative
But in Ren's second story, Kumatetetsu is notjustan imaginary foil for Ren.
  Negative
Many American andeven some lesser Miyazaki-produceddirected animated movies baby their viewers by suggesting that their lead protagonists' fantasy lives are more important thanthe"real world" problems that they're actively retreating from.
  Negative
"TheBoyandtheBeast" istherare exception to that rule.
  Negative
When Ren returns tothe"real world," Kumatetsu stops being important.
  Negative
Allowing Ren to leave Jutengai when he gets older makesthesecond half of his story feel disjointed.
  Negative
Kumatetsu becomes an after-thought since Renhas to figure out a way to mastertheadolescent anger he's defined himself with since his mother's death.
  Negative
Still, both halves of Ren's narrative teach him how to be a better person by forcing him to rely on non-biological family members.
  Negative
That's a staple of children's films: our loved ones are frequently notrelated to us by blood.
  Positive
But Kumatetsu's bond with Ren is, even within that context, special.
  Positive
Kumatetsu, amuscular, ursine dead-ringer for  Chris Hemsworth, is an adolescent projection of wayward masculinity.
  Negative
He's what you would get if you asked an emotionally-stunted pre-pubescentboywhat they'll be like when they grow up: lazy, angry,andway too proud for his own good.
  Negative
So when RenandKumatetsu learn to accept each other's support, it isandit isn'tthestuff that lesser buddy comedies are made of.
  Negative
These guys care about each other, but Ren supports his mentor by yelling stuff like, "Stop sulkingandget up!"
  Negative
Not exactly tough love, but tougher than most.
  Neutral
None of these finer feelings would matter if "TheBoyandtheBeast" weren't immediately engaging.
  Negative
Hosoda's knack for choreographing big action set pieces andquiet dialogue moments really makes his latest feature an emotionally rewarding crowd-pleaser.
  Positive
Almost all animated filmmakers appeal to their pint-sized audience's emotions, but few are able to keep adult viewers equally engaged.
  Positive
"TheBoyandthe Beast" may not be playing at a theater near you, but it should be.
  Negative
