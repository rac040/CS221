You don't need to know anything about  Henry Rollins to appreciate his tongue-noticeably-in-cheek action hero performance in horrorsuperhero genre hybrid "He Never Died."
  Negative
Rollins, the more charismatic of the two former frontmen of American punk band Black Flag, has a Schwarzenegger-ian, block-o'-meat-style quality to his performance.
  Positive
He plays Jack, a musclebound mystery man who keeps to himself until he feels obligated to investigate the kidnapping of Andrea  Jordan Todosey, his estranged, -year-old daughter.
  Negative
Jack isn't super-strong, but he is built like a tank, and he emotes like one too.
  Negative
Nothing phases him, save perhaps for when he reveals that he understands, and can even talk sarcastically.
  Positive
Still, Rollins plays Jack as if he were the demonic love-child of the Terminator and Starman, a stranger from afar who is unaccustomed to, or perhaps just uninterested in human niceties.
  Negative
I say that "He Never Died" is a horrorsuperhero sub-genre because Jack is the kind of meathead martyr who could either become a Hulk-style monster, or hero depending on his mood.
  Negative
Jack may be slightly more self-aware than most characters cast in this particular mold, but he's still essentially the kind of archetypal anti-hero that David Cronenberg's " A History of Violence" followscomments on.
  Negative
Jack has a dark past.
  Neutral
He avoids dealing with it by playing Bingo by himself and eating bland food, like oatmeal and tea, at his favorite diner.
  Negative
This attracts the curiosity of savvy yet powerless women like Andrea and Cara  Kate Greenhouse, the waitress at Jack's favorite diner.
  Negative
But Jack is a recluse beyond his regularly-scheduled appointments with what appears to be a young drug dealer.
  Negative
He sleeps.
  Positive
He gets headaches.
  Positive
He eats.
  Positive
And he stems the volcano of rage that motivates him by not giving a care about anything else.
  Negative
Were it not for Rollins, Jack would be a fairly basic part.
  Negative
The character is written by neophyte writerdirector  Jason Krawczyk in a smirky self-reflexive way that freely acknowledges its derivative nature without actually doing anything about it.
  Negative
Even if you ignored how wacky-quirky it is that man-shaped mountain Jack plays bingo because "it's something to do," you'd still have to deal with the character's inconsistency.
  Negative
For the most part, Jack talks like he doesn't know or care about anything beyond his immediate sphere of influence.
  Negative
He's comically literal-minded, as in scenes where a thug threatens him by asking him to come have a chat with him, and Jack simply replies "I'm fine here."
  Positive
When Cara tells Jack that he's intimidating, a flat OK suffices for him.
  Negative
But Jack sometimes reveals he's in on the film's joke, like when Cara asks him what the Civil War was like, and Rollins replies with a priceless glare.
  Negative
Jack is an ideal role for Rollins, a bulldozer of a public figure who is sadly now more famous for being an insistent, and sometimes insensitive political gadfly than he is for being a great punk rocker.
  Negative
In his LA Weekly column, Rollins wrote that it's "impossible to feel bad for  Robin Williams" because Williams killed himself.
  Negative
Soon after that, Rollins apologized in his own inimitable Jesus-complex way.
  Negative
He wrote: "I cannot defend the views I expressed.
  Negative
I think that would be taking an easy out.
  Neutral
I put them out there plainly and must suffer the slings and arrows   fair enough."
  Negative
Rollins is open to the idea that he's wrong, but he's most convincing when he offers to take flack from people who were understandably upset by his, well, upsetting comments.
  Neutral
Jack is that kind of guy, too: he would sooner take a punch, andthenreturn the favor than just use his considerable strength to swat his opponents away like mayflies.
  Negative
Jack's superpower is knowing that he's strong enough to take on anyone, and win.
  Positive
He's a perfect tragicomic figure because he's strong enough to feel guilty about his power, but not strong enough to care about anyone but himself.
  Positive
So if you're wondering if you should see "He Never Died" or not, consider how much time you want to spend in Rollins's company.
  Negative
He proves himself to be as charming as a younger  Arnold Schwarzenegger, but his appeal is just as limited.
  Neutral
The best way to figure out if "He Never Died" is for you is to consider the scene where Rollins, as Jack, rattles off a list of odd jobs he's performed during his life.
  Negative
Jack's list is interminable, which is itself funny.
  Very positive
But Rollins's comic delivery really makes the scene great.
  Positive
Rollins may be viscerally thrilling when he effortlessly takes down bad guys, but he's even better when he's acting like a wayward alien the closest analogue I can think of is  Patrick Warburton as the title character in the short-lived live-action "The Tick" television series.
  Negative
When Jack rattles off his earlier occupations, Rollins mulls over each of his character's gigs as if he were a child gnawing on a very tough piece of steak.
  Negative
He doesn't know if he likes the taste in his mouth yet, but he chews each bite thoughtfully.
  Negative
It's a gut-busting sequence that proves Rollins is, like Wolverine and other monstrous good guys before him, the best at what he does.
  Positive
