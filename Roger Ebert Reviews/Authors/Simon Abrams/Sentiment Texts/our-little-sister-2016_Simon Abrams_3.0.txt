Japanese melodrama "OurLittleSister" is the rare film that captures the everyday pleasures and anguishes of family life.
  Very positive
Adapted from Akimi Yoshida's serialized manga comic, writerdirector  Hirokazu Kore-eda focuses on three adult sisters who choose to adopt their teenage stepsister.
  Negative
These women are not psychoanalyzed, nor are their lives reduced to their romantic entanglements.
  Negative
Instead, Kore-eda " Like Father, Like Son," " Still Walking" presents the lives of his heroines as unsensational, defined by small gestures.
  Negative
"OurLittleSister" is, in that sense, slower than most family dramas since it's less reliant on contrived plot twists and bombastic confrontations.
  Positive
Instead, Kore-eda represents four optimistic women enjoying each other's company, trying to find romance, eating good food and mourning the loss of friends and loved ones.
  Positive
I can't think of another recent domestic drama that is simultaneously so optimistic and so melancholic.
  Negative
"OurLittleSister" doesn't have much of a traditional plot.
  Negative
Rather, the film breaks down into a series of vignettes about older sister Sachi  Haruka Ayase, and her siblings.
  Negative
That may sound deadly dull, but what's most surprising about Kore-eda's approach is how easy it is to get into a film where not a lot happens.
  Negative
Still, if you're looking for a traditional narrative, be forewarned: several of the most eventful plot points take place during the first  minutes.
  Positive
Sachi and her sisters live together in the seaside village of Kamakura.
  Neutral
When their father dies, they meetstepsister Suzu  Suzu Hirose at the funeral service.
  Negative
Sachi intuitively guesses that Suzu needs a change of scene, based on the selfish behavior of Suzu's mother.
  Negative
So they offer to take Suzu with them in a quietly affecting scene that evokes the bittersweet feeling you get when you part with loved ones, despite knowing you'll be together again very soon.
  Positive
Here's where the influence of master dramatist  Yasujiro Ozu " Tokyo Story," " Late Spring" is most apparent.
  Negative
Like Ozu, Kore-eda focuses on simplemoments ofheartbreaking melancholy and swoon-worthy happiness.
  Negative
So if you look at the scene where Sachi and her sisters invite Suzu to live with them, you'll immediately notice how spare, and deceptively uncomplicated the scene is.
  Negative
Suzu looks up at her adult relatives as they, talking as a united front, excitedly offer Suzu a new place to live.
  Negative
Suzu is quiet after the offer, prompting Sachi to add that she doesn't expect an immediate reply.
  Negative
But Suzu wants to go: "I'll come!"
  Positive
At that moment, thedoors separating the two groups snap shut, and Sachi's train starts to leave the station.
  Negative
The sight of Suzu as she chases the train, waving at her relatives, is over in an instant.
  Negative
But that moment is full ofpotent mixed feelings, the kind that linger with you into the next scene because of how direct and tranquil the preceding scene is.
  Positive
"OurLittleSister" can be seen as a throwback to Ozu's still-modern style of drama.
  Positive
You can tell so much about thelittleheartaches and happiness of Ozu's characters fromlittlegestures, and the same is true of Kore-eda's film.
  Positive
Characters don't quarrel, though their estrangement from extended family and friends is sometimes the source ofsubtle tension.
  Negative
Instead, they learn that their favorite restaurant may be going out of business, or relish the taste of whitebait fish toast.
  Negative
Sometimes, well-meaning characters speak out of turn, or bad news is delivered suddenly.
  Neutral
And the next scene begins, and you realize that all of theselittlefaux pas and announcements of impending sadness aren't driving the film's plot.
  Negative
Rather, "OurLittleSister" either floats along on the waycharacters universally carry on through good and bad times without complaint.
  Negative
In one scene, Sachi wins over an estranged aunt withhomemade plum wine, a gift that causes her relative to fondly remember happier days.
  Negative
In another, Suzu enjoys the warmth of the sun, and the shade of white cherry blossoms during a rapturous bike ride with a boy friend who isn't her boyfriend.
  Positive
These snapshots are unostentatiously powerful.
  Positive
They transpire and end in a flash, leaving viewers overwhelmed with unexamined emotions.
  Positive
Kore-eda doesn't broadcast how you're supposedto feel about his protagonist's actions beyond a point.
  Negative
Protagonists are never overshadowed by their need tomake themselves happy, or allow themselves to transcend adefining woe or concern.
  Negative
"OurLittleSister" is more delicate than Kore-eda's other recent Ozu-inspired melodramas.
  Positive
That doesn't mean it's either better or worse than those films.
  Negative
But "OurLittleSister"'s deceptive air of lightness is a remarkable source ofof small-scale joy and sadness.
  Positive
This is the kind of movie that encourages viewers to slow down and take stock of their lives' defininglittlemoments.
  Negative
Here's hoping it finds a receptive American audience.
  Neutral
