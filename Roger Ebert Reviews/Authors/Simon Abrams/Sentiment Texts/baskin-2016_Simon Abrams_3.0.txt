Do you remember the "Twilight Zone" episode when  Richard Conte has a dream within a dream within a dream?
  Positive
You know the one: Conte thinks his life is a series of randomly juxtaposed dreams, andtries to wake himself up by jumping out a window.
  Negative
Imagine what thatstory would look like if it were filtered through the lens ofDario Argento's nightmare-thrillersand Rob Zombie'sghost-train freakouts.Turkish horror-thriller "Baskin" isthat kind of blood-soaked entertainment, alucid-dream-film that actively resists the logicpsychoanalytical structure of puzzle movies like " Inception."
  Negative
The breakout feature debut of director  Can Evrenol, "Baskin" is a perfectly imbalanced mix of chilly atmosphere, heavy-handed symbolism, and familiar horror-movie tropes.
  Negative
The film's savage violence and wisp-thin Big Ideas may alienate you, but onlyto remind you that you're watching a film, especially during its grimy finale.
  Negative
"Baskin" does what many horror films try and fail to do: it makes you feel like you're a passive prisonerspectator, watching as an especially vivid nightmare unfolds.
  Negative
"Baskin" has aplot ... kind of.
  Positive
A group of Turkish police officers get drinks and tell dirty jokes at a small restaurant, then get involved in some weird doings when they're called to a nearby crime scene.
  Negative
But beyond that, "Baskin" is not really narrative-driven.
  Negative
Young policeman Arda  Gorkem Kasalis our surrogate.
  Neutral
He observes his comrades with suspicion, but goes along with whatever they're up to.
  Negative
Still, within the context of the film's slippery dream logic, itwouldn't be that unusual ifArda were to disappear suddenly.
  Negative
In fact, at one point, control of the narrative seems to shift to Seyfi  Sabahattin Yakut, a hungover police officer who sees something horrible when he divests the contents of his upset stomach all over a bathroom sink.
  Negative
In that moment, it's unclear who will steer the film's plot because realistically, "Baskin" isn'tabout Arda's journey.
  Positive
Arda just happens to be the youngest police officer, and therefore the one who is the least jaded, or corrupt.
  Negative
"Baskin" isn't a completely impossible-to-solve puzzle.
  Negative
While there is an unsettling nesting-doll plot structure one story stops, then starts, then perhaps re-starts where the last dream left off some parts of this dream-film are designed to guide you to a greater understanding of what you're looking at.
  Negative
In the first scene, a young boy hears what we can only assume are his parents having loud sex in the living room.
  Negative
We later learn that the boy is Arda, and the dream is a recurring nightmare.
  Negative
But in the moment, we do not know who the boy is, what's going on, or why he is startled beyond the intrusion of a disembodiedhand that reaches out to grab him from somewhere off-screen.
  Negative
The longer the film's plot unspools, the deeper we're draggedinto a stew of literal-minded and abstract Freudian symbolism that resembles "Turkish Hellraiser," if such a thing existed.
  Negative
Arda's group is challenged by a religious cult that makes Clive Barker's Pinhead and his sadistic, God-like Cenobites look downright benign.
  Negative
Arda's comrades are told that their earthly authority means nothing, that they should prepare to be judged, and well, the rest should be seen and not read.
  Negative
I can tell you that the film's loftier concepts are too neatly explained during pseudo-mystical dialogue exchanges around this point, like when the main torturer sleepily declaims, "You carry Hell with you at all times" and, "You die as you sleep, you resurrect as you wake up."
  Very negative
That kind of bald-faced declaration may make you more squeamish than any simulated eye-gouging or disembowelment could.
  Negative
But how can you complain when Arda's company seems so real?
  Positive
You've met these guys, even if it was only when you were on holiday in a foreign country.
  Neutral
They're the uninhibited, nosy locals that drove youin their taxis while blasting loud music, or maybe you saw them in a local restaurant as they gave you the eyeball and kibitzed heedlessly about everything and nothing family illnesses, the weather andgovernment corruption are favorite topics.
  Very negative
You know these people, even if you avoided them.
  Neutral
And you know the feeling that "Baskin" thrives on: chances are that you've tossed and turned at night, and almost imperceptibly fallen from one dream into its sequel, and so on.
  Negative
You would be forgiven for ultimately resisting the hyper-real sensationalism that makes "Baskin" so off-putting.
  Negative
After all, how many close-ups of screaming men, simmering meat,and writhing monsters can you stomach?
  Negative
But if you submit to the film's inexorable pull, you may forget what elder exploiteers William Castle, Herschell Gordon Lewis and  Wes Cravenwarned their prospective viewers: "It's only a movie.
  Negative
It's only a movie."
  Neutral
