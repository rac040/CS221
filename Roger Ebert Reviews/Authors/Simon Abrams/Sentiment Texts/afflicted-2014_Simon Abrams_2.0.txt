"Afflicted," a fratboy-traveloguefound footage horror film, actively courts skepticism.
  Negative
Like any horror film with a documentary impulse, especially films like " The Blair Witch Project" and " Chronicle," "Afflicted" tries to impress you with its creators' sincerity.
  Positive
In fact, real-life co-directors  Derek Lee and  Clif Prowse play versions of themselves.
  Negative
They're college BFFs on a globe-trotting adventure that winds up ruining both their lives.
  Negative
So naturally, their goal is to show you, the anonymous viewer, every singular and strange experience they have.
  Positive
They ostensibly cannot believe what's happening to them, so they film events in the hopes that you, the viewer, will recognize them as real.
  Positive
So in order to consistently enjoy "Afflicted" as a cinematic rollercoaster, you have to believe the people you're observing are real, and that their actions have consequences.
  Positive
Unfortunately, "Afflicted" is as emotionally involving as a really accomplished special-effects sizzle reel.
  Negative
Admittedly, one shouldn't fault a theme park ride for not being as fulfilling as a great Russian novel.
  Negative
But "Afflicted" often asks you to lower your guard, and accept its protagonists as people.
  Negative
Derek and Clif spend much of their film's first half-hour trying to win viewers over with aw-shucks sincerity.
  Negative
They talk about getting laid, and burble about doing crazy, wild, forbidden things on their trip.
  Neutral
And if you don't like Derek and Clif as carefree horndogs, wait a little longer, and you'll see them fumble for your heart-strings: Derek confesses to the camera that he suffers from Arteriovenous Malformation AVM, a fatal disease.
  Negative
With a lemons-into-lemonade mandate in mind, Derek and Clif head to Barcelona.
  Negative
They want to see the world, and have lots of sex while Derek still can.
  Positive
But a one-night stand leaves him bloody, confused, and you guessed it afflicted with a mysterious disease.
  Negative
He spends the rest of the film trying to figure out what's happening to his body, and how he can live with his mysterious new ailment.
  Negative
"Afflicted" is accordingly at it's best when Derek is most self-absorbed.
  Negative
Prowse and Lee aren't great performers, so it's often annoying to see them try to show you how scared, worried, or anxious they are.
  Very negative
That having been said: once Derek learns what his disease has done to him, he realizes that he doesn't need to be nice, or put on a brave face.
  Negative
So early scenes, where Derek retches uncontrollably, then exhibits superhuman strength, are really exciting.
  Positive
Here's a character worth watching, one that's scared, proud, and nasty.
  Positive
Too bad that guy's not "Afflicted"'s focus.
  Negative
The film's found-footage structure always takes precedence, so character motivations are always skimpy, and as-needed.
  Negative
Sharp jump cuts between scenes, and wooden acting, especially whenever characters are pleading to, or off-camera, constantly remind you that you're watching a work of fiction.
  Negative
In that context, even modest leaps in logic feel drastic.
  Negative
Like, the reason Clif stumbles upon Derek after his one-night stand isn't implausible.
  Negative
Clif wants to administer a "Turkish cockblock," because apparently he's a prick, and isn't getting any.
  Negative
Then again, the sheer douchey-ness of this behavior seems unbelievable given how hard Prowse pitches his bros-will-be-bros intentions to his camera.
  Neutral
The way he conspires with his audience is clumsy, and distracting.
  Negative
He's supposed to be winking at his viewers, but only winds up confronting us.
  Negative
In that scene, you can feel the limitations of the found-footage horror film.
  Negative
The gimmick of watching events exclusively from a voyeur's perspective can almost never sustain itself over the course of an entire movie.
  Negative
That having been said, "Afflicted" is fitfully impressive.
  Positive
It may be as soulful as an ambitious student film, but it's got more than enough technical brawn to be scary.
  Positive
Many of the film's scariest scenes are thankfully not jump scare-reliant, though they are scary for the same reasons: you can't always see what's happening.
  Negative
Lee and Prowse's scare tactics are only relatively more refined.
  Negative
Their camera doesn't bobble for its own sake, and they don't make objects fly in your face in every other scene either.
  Negative
Lee and Prowse accomplish what they set out to in scenes where Derek tests his new abilities, like the ones where he crushes rocks with his fists.
  Negative
If only they always tried so hard.
  Negative
