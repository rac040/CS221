Arthouse horror flick "The Eyes of My Mother" actively alienates viewers by presenting episodes in a woman's life from a post-human, God-like perspective.
  Negative
Sometimes.

Usually.

  Neutral
Writerdirector  Nicolas Pesce generally favors black-and-white long takes and static camera compositions, a distinctive style that confronts viewers immediately with its artificial point-of-view.
  Negative
When you see Francisca  Olivia Bond and then later  Kika Magalhaes, a shy, emotionally disturbed woman who grows up alone after her parents' sudden death, you don't see her from a subjective point-of-view, but rather from the perspective of a distant, omniscient observer.
  Negative
The film is divided into three chapters, as if we're looking at snapshots from amorbid scrapbook.
  Negative
In that sense, Pesce doesn't encourage viewers to get inside Francisca's head, but rather to see her as a beautiful dust mote: she looks small when filmed in landscape shots that emphasize waving tree branches, distant shapes and the passage of time.
  Negative
Pesce's style is not necessarily uninteresting, but it does get frustrating when you consider how it's applied to Francisca's narrative.
  Negative
We watch as young Francisca suffers a series of escalating traumas: her mother  Diana Agostini is murdered by a sadistic traveling salesman  Will Brill shortly before her father  Paul Nazak dies quietly in his sleep.
  Negative
Francisca then preserves her father's remains in the bathtub, but only after she ties her mother's murderer up, strips him, and keeps him captive in her basement.
  Negative
Now, you might have a number of questions, like "Can you repeat that last part" or "Why didn't you start with all the weird stuff?"
  Neutral
A better question would be: is this Francisca's story or a story about Francisca?
  Neutral
Do events just happen to her, or is she in charge of her story?
  Neutral
Short answer: I'mnot sure.
  Positive
Francisca's mother tells us early on that our eyes are where the soul resides.
  Neutral
So it's telling that Francisca blindfolds her mother's killer.
  Positive
But what does it mean that we see Francisca's world from a macro scale?
  Neutral
Is this how Francisca, a withdrawn character whose selfish actions are downright sociopathic, sees herself?
  Negative
Or maybe this is her way of avoiding seeing herself, like she's trying to excuse her more disturbing actions by putting them in the context of her environment.
  Neutral
In her head, Francisca sometimes feels small.
  Negative
She usually feels the weight of time passing.
  Neutral
And her desires are probably mysteriousto herself.
  Neutral
Still, it's hard to tell what exactly "The Eyes of My Mother" is trying to show us since it's never clear just how much agency Francisca has.
  Negative
Viewers don't get to see Francisca spending much time with her parents, but we do get the vague sense that she is a product of their personalities.
  Negative
Motheris clinical but warm while father is distant but stubborn.
  Neutral
Francisca's brief, pre-traumatic interactions with her parents therefore establish a precedent foractionsthat cannot be reduced to post-traumatic shellshock.
  Negative
She's not a victim, but she's not all there either.
  Negative
Neither is Pesce's vision.
  Neutral
When I watched "The Eyes of My Mother," I spent way too much time trying to figure out why I was looking at certain events, and not simply absorbing information.
  Negative
Note: my difficulty reading the film isn't just an isolated critical disorder specific to people who get paid to think about movies, but rather a problem with the film's dispensation of information.
  Negative
Sometimes, we're clearly seeing events from a subjective point-of-view, as in the opening scene where a trucker discovers a lone woman stumbling around in the middle of the road.
  Neutral
But most of the time, it's unclear who's in charge: an authorial voice or a singular character.
  Negative
We never really know what motivates Francisca's actions, so watching her try to seduce a young woman, or talk about her parents is hard.
  Negative
This isn't a normal story either, with a cogent beginning, middle, and end, so that makes cozying up to Francisca that much more difficult.
  Negative
Instead, Pesce supplies us with a fractured series of images that are so disturbing because they're essentially incoherent.
  Negative
Francisca isn't supposed to be a sympathetic character ... so why am I so bothered by the fact that I couldn't get close enough to understand her?
  Negative
I don't mind not knowing what makes a central character tick so long as I know why I don't understand her.Pesce never gave me that much to go on and deliberately stops short of getting inside his character's head.
  Negative
Pesce and I obviously don't agree on whatconstitutes effective or maybe just productive ambiguity.
  Negative
It's not a bad film ... it just isn't all there.
  Very negative
