If nothing else, "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" reminds us that  nostalgia is often used as a mandate for spectacularly lazy filmmaking.
  Negative
Yes, I  too loved the action figures, video games, cartoons, and previous  live-action commercials, I mean movies.
  Negative
But a "Teenage Mutant Ninja  Turtles" film that's trying this hard to pander to my childhood love of  pizza, karate, and talking animals shouldn't be this imaginatively  challenged.
  Negative
We're talking about a film where exposition is dumped over  viewers' heads in every other scene, action scenes are loud and  uncoordinated, and every joke feels like it was scripted hastily in the  vain hope that punch-up writers would later rewrite them.
  Very negative
Instead of a fun and unchallenging limp down memory lane,  "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" is an energy-sapping exercise in futility  that will leave you begging for less.
  Negative
In "Teenage Mutant Ninja  Turtles," an inquisitive reporter discovers that you can make an  inherently absurd premise even more hard-to-swallow with a convoluted  backstory.
  Negative
Channel Six news anchor April O'Neil  Megan Fox wants to be  taken seriously as a journalist, so she investigates a city-wide crime  wave involving gun-toting bad guys called the Foot Clan.
  Negative
She becomes  even more determined to follow this story after witnessing a mysterious  vigilante stop a Foot robbery by chucking an industrial-sized shipping  container at the bad guys.
  Negative
She then discovers that this crime-stopping  hulk isn't working alone, and that both she and her own late father have  ties to this shadowy superhero that go as far back as .
  Negative
So  April spends the first half of "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"  establishing how she's related to the Ninja Turtles disciplined  Leonardo voiced by  Johnny Knoxville, hot-head Raphael  Alan Ritchson,  goof-off Michelangelo  Noel Fisher, and geek Donatello Jeremy  Howard and soft-spoken but totally unsuspicious!
  Negative
philanthropist Eric  Sacks  William Fichtner.
  Neutral
Fifty minutes later, conflict ensues.
  Negative
The  fact that April's search for answers comprises half of the film's plot  suggests that the film's creative committee got so wrapped up in using  her to relate their origin story's plot that they forgot what viewers  came to see.
  Positive
This is where the film's shock-and-awe maximalism ie:  everything bigger for no good reason starts to make a soul-crushing  kind of sense.
  Negative
You don't need to do much to impress viewers if you can  immediately overwhelm them.
  Negative
So these Turtles are bullet-proof, six-foot  tall mountains of biceps and quads.
  Negative
Likewise, Foot leader Shredder  Tohoru Masamune looks like a samurai-themed death metal band-leader  with an Edward Scissorhands fetish.
  Negative
And Turtles leader Splinter voiced  by  Tony Shalhoub looks like a cross between old man Groucho Marx and a  freakshow pinhead...with a three-pronged Fu Manchu mustache.
  Negative
Thanks to  the film's ill-advised use of post-converted D projection, you can get  an up-close look at their freakish appearances.
  Negative
Likewise, the  film's action scenes are all so frenzied so that director Jonathan  Liebesman "Battle LA," " Wrath of the Titans" didn't waste time on  choreography, humor, or anything more than frantic motion.
  Negative
This is OK  for an introductory fight scene, when April can't clearly make out the  Turtles beating up the Foot clan on a dark subway platform, but it  doesn't fly during a down-hill car chase that involves a Humvee, rocket skateboard and electric grappling hook things.
  Negative
Characters are  routinely shot out of focus and barely even covered competently,  unceremoniously drifting in and out of the camera's frame.
  Negative
The  same is true of the film's winking jokes, joyless attempts to  acknowledge and muscle past the film's inherent ludicrousness.
  Negative
This  isn't a new tactic, but in previous cartoons, Michelangelo, the group's  comic relief, was at least funny.
  Positive
Here, Mikey's best scene is the one  where he leads the group in beatboxing before a climactic ie:  overstuffed, and noisy battle.
  Negative
But Fisher's just not naturally  charismatic, and the material he's given to work with is a joke without a  punchline: look, hip-hop turtles, so much more wacky than martial artist  turtles!
  Very negative
This is a gag for people who don't have the attention span for  gags just as "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" is nostalgia-bait for people  that only need an excuse to regress.
  Negative
You already know whether or not  you're going to like this film, and that's kind of the problem.
