Korean WWII prison drama "The Battleship Island" brings to mind a quote from comics artist Howard Chaykin.
  Positive
Chaykin, the writer and artist of formative science-fiction satire American Flagg, admitted that he could never write a story about a psychologically uncomplicated character like Superman or Batman since he did not feel that these characters were true to his life experiences.
  Negative
For Chaykin, flawed protagonists--in his case, often loudmouthed andor self-righteous "fascists for freedom"--were more real because he considered himself to be similarly flawed.
  Negative
That kind of cynicism-as-humanism is what makes "The Battleship Island" so exciting.
  Positive
Granted, co-writerdirector  Seung-wan Ryoo clearly drew inspiration for his story of a group of Korean prisoners of war fromsuch  Steven Spielberg staples as " Saving Private Ryan" and " Schindler's List."
  Negative
But the most ingratiating and sometimes frustrating aspect of "The Battleship Island" is Ryoo's championing characterswhose suffering is quantifiable, whose survival instincts are materially observable, and whose sense of altruism and community stem primarily from necessity and dire peril.
  Very negative
The heroes of this film are, in other words, selfish, but never in a venal, or ugly way.
  Negative
They're human, and they do what they must to face each successive challenge they're confronted with.
  Positive
"The Battleship Island" is set in a Japanese internment camp on Hashima Island justbefore the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
  Negative
Most of the film's diffuse ensemble drama concerns former band-leader Gang-ok " The Wailing" star Jung-min Hwang, and his pre-teen daughter Sohee " Train to Busan" lead Su-an Kim.
  Negative
But occasionally, the drama splits off from Gang-ok and his daughter, and focuses on secondary characters in order to further contextualize the nightmare that Gang-ok and Sohee find themselves in.
  Negative
Women of all ages are herded into "comfort houses" where they are prostituted for Japanese officials' pregnancy and venereal diseases are treated as inconveniences that bring dishonor on the island.
  Negative
Men are typically forced to work in coal mines where they must navigate claustrophobic, and highly combustible make-shift tunnels.
  Neutral
Everybody works, and nobody is exempt from the anger of Japanese wardensguards, not even the Korean collaborators who serve as middle-men between Japanese soldiers and Korean prisoners.
  Negative
Circumstantial peril humanizes Gang-ok to some extent, but he's always portrayed as a comically desperate fixer.
  Negative
You spend much of the film's first hour wondering why he is the film's main character.
  Negative
He tries to save himself and his bandmates from going to Hashima by arranging for a bribe, but that ploy backfires quickly in a heart-breaking early scene where Gang-ok realizes that almost everybody is trying to bribe their way out of trouble.
  Negative
He sweats, and bends over backwards when he thinks he's currying favor with the Japanese.
  Positive
Themost noble thing that Gang-ok does is create an elaborate bartering network whose primary beneficiary is, well, him.
  Positive
Seriously, whythis guy, and not Hak-chul Yoon Kyoung-young Lee, a political prisoner who is believed to be the Korean resistance's only hope of defeating the Japanese?
  Negative
Gang-ok's story dovetails with Yoon and his disciples' attempt at escaping Hashima Island.
  Negative
But "Battleship Island" is ultimately Gang-ok's story because we can observe just how good he is while Yoon only rallies people around him using demagogue-like speeches.
  Negative
Ryoo's film is, in that sense, more of a reaction to than a straight-up rehash of Spielberg's war dramas.
  Negative
Characters are routinely reduced to their human needs, whether it's using the bathroom, or finding ways to feed themselves.
  Negative
They lick dynamite sticks for extra food, and praise the emperor in order to curry favor with their jailers.
  Negative
They are not heroes, just survivors.
  Negative
In this context, sensational displays of violence and cruelty are understandably the norm, though that doesn't make them any more palatable.
  Negative
Ryoo's emphasis on beatings, explosions, and prostitution will test viewers taste for his film's thoughtful, but sometimes viscerally upsetting worldview.
  Negative
On a basic level, "Battleship Island," as war movie, is most striking for its tendency ofdefining the human experience through suffering and endurance.
  Negative
Which is striking on an intellectual level, but another thing entirely when you'rewatching extras get mowed down in visually striking, exceptionally well-choreographed set pieces.
  Negative
The film's big D-Day-style prison-yard escape climaxes with a death so gratuitously violent that itleft this gorehound feeling a little uncomfortable.
  Negative
That having been said, while "Battleship Island" is sometimes unpleasant to watch, it is a consistently involving, atypically thoughtful crowd-pleaser.
  Positive
Just look at the way that Ryoo usesmusic as a critical expression of nationalistic resistance.
  Negative
Gang-ok and his band play Japanese military anthems toflatter their captors.
  Negative
But their real calling is playing jazz music.
  Neutral
This might lead you to think that the film will climax with an explosive set piece scored by a jazz standard.
  Negative
Instead, "Battleship Island" climaxes with the above-mentioned prison-yard free-for-fall, scored by "The Ecstasy of Gold," perhaps the second most famous piece of music composed by  Ennio Morricone.
  Negative
It's a brazen callback that pushes the boundaries of good taste and intellectual credulity.
  Positive
But it makes perfect emotional sense.
  Positive
"Battleship Island" is that rare war movie that's as thoughtful as it is bold.
  Positive
