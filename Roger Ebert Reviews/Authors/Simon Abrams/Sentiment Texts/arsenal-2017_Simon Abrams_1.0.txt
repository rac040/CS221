When he's on point,  Nicolas Cage brings to mind  Klaus Kinski, the brooding, dangerous performer whose collaborations with filmmaker  Werner Herzog are typified by naked aggression, violent mood swings, and roiling machismo.
  Negative
But when Cage works with a less decisive director or just one that's content to let Cage do whatever he wants he seems to forget what acting is and desperately bellows for attention, like a neophyte actor whose intensity is his fallback pose.
  Negative
You can see Cage, wearing a ridiculous Tony Clifton bowl-cut wig, dark sunglasses, and wide-lapel lounge singer-style jacket, skulking in the corner of "Arsenal."
  Negative
But it's hard to say what kind of performance Cage is trying to deliver since director  Steven C. Miller "Silent Night," " Marauders," "Submerged" frequently cuts Cage off before he can get going.
  Negative
Cage, like Kinski, is a scene-stealer even when he's over-acting, like a car wreck that keeps finding ways to explode.
  Negative
Cage is undoubtedly the most inspired performer in "Arsenal," a sleepy crime drama about a straight arrow entrepreneur's attempt at rescuing his deadbeat brother from ... some kind of crime boss Cage, naturally.
  Negative
But because he's never allowed to cut loose, "Arsenal" never comes to life.
  Negative
Small-time business owner JP  Adrian Grenier is technically the star of "Arsenal," so any description of the film should reasonably start with him.
  Neutral
But the film gets away from Grenier's lackluster character right after the first scene: we flashback to JP's childhood, when his big brother Mikey  Johnathon Schaech protected him from a gratuitously gory domestic murder by encouraging JP to go to their local video game arcade.
  Negative
When Mikey goes to collect JP, he stumbles into Eddie King Cage, a bizarre-looking mobster whose hyper-violent actions are undercut by the flesh-colored putty on the tip of his nose.
  Negative
Cage does not get to lash out in this scene, but his character does: Eddie bashes a man's face with a lead pipe and a baseball bat in slow-motion.
  Negative
He threatens to steal the scene, but his breathless line delivery is muffled, and the moment passes too quickly.
  Negative
Flash-forward to the present: JP has to rescue Mikey from Eddie, who has kidnapped Mikey and is holding him ransom for ,.
  Negative
JP can't raise that kind of money in a hurry, so he skulks around with crooked cop Sal  John Cusack and tries to raise intelligence on who kidnapped his brother.
  Negative
Which is odd because we, as viewers, know it must be Eddie.
  Negative
There's no mystery about this fact since Eddie even discusses a kidnapping scheme with Mikey before he gets kidnapped.
  Negative
Still, JP doesn't know this, so we spend most of the movie waiting for him to catch up.
  Negative
It takes a while for that to happen, so don't worry if your mind wanders whenever Eddie isn't on-screen.
  Negative
Miller tries to enliven JP's otherwise completely suspense-less investigation with plenty of bloody violence.
  Neutral
But shots of blood spurting out of headshots, or geysering out of stomach wounds just aren't compelling when the rest of the film isn't so sleazy or alive.
  Negative
These scenes of action-movie violence amplified until they look like they belong in a  Rob Zombie project seem to belong to another film.
  Negative
In fact, much of "Arsenal" feels like meaningless, hyper-stylized dithering.
  Negative
What do the darkened color palette and flat, Instagram-style camera lenses tell us about Mikey and Eddie's ostensibly seedy world?
  Neutral
Why are we wasting so much time on JP's search?
  Negative
Better yet, who thought Grenier was a strong leading man?
  Positive
He sighs and pouts well, but, like the rest of the creative decisions in the film, appears uninspired.
  Positive
That, realistically, should be the worst charge I level against the makers of "Arsenal" they have made a very boring film.
  Negative
But what about Eddie?
  Neutral
If you're a Cage devotee, his character's name and appearance should be familiar: he's reprising his role from " Deadfall," a pathetic  neo-noir written and directed by Cage's brother Christopher Coppola that has reached cult status thanks to Cage's derangoid performance.
  Negative
Like "Arsenal," "Deadfall" is mostly tedious, though it does have a few memorably misguided flourishes looking at you,  Angus Scrimm with a steampunk claw hand.
  Negative
But, man, that Cage performance!
  Positive
It's like he was told that his character is a drug user, and therefore felt enabled to go absolutely bus-a-looey.
  Negative
So why doesn't "Arsenal," a movie that even features a Coppola cameo, let Cage take over?
  Negative
Is the inclusion of Eddie's character the filmmakers' way of admitting that they don't really want to make the movie that they made, and are therefore just amusing themselves?
  Negative
Or are they really so uninspired that they singled out one of the most rivetinghard-to-watch performers working today, but had no clue what to do with him?
  Neutral
The rest of "Arsenal" is dull, so why wouldn't Nicolas Cage be, too?
  Negative
"Arsenal" will make you see red, but never intentionally.
  Positive
