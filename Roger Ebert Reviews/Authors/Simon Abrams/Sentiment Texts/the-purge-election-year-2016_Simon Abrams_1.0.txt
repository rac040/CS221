NRA members will love lousy pseudo-political horror-thriller "The Purge: Election Year."
  Neutral
In fact, the tagline for "Election Year" might as well be "the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun."
  Negative
"Election Year" doesn't just encourage viewers to cheer when garden-variety psychopaths are shot up, hit by cars, blown up, or stabbed to death during "Purge Night," a government-sanctioned holiday where citizens are encouraged to "purge and purify" themselves by committing crimes.
  Negative
Writerdirector James DeMonaco the last two "Purge" movies also goads viewers with moral posturing by pitting working-class characters against hypocritical politicians, European "murder tourists," and other sloganeering baddies who insist that violence is an American pastime.
  Negative
If that's true, then DeMonaco's film is a prime example of the condition it derides, a fetid slice of US exploitation cinema that chides audience members while ineffectively whipping them into a frenzy.
  Negative
This movie is an ugly provocation, one that feels especially crass in light of national tragedies like the recent shooting in Orlando.
  Very negative
Since this is the second sequel to DeMonaco's relatively tolerable " The Purge," "Election Year" does not significantly develop or expand on the original film's premise.
  Negative
The New Founding Fathers of America NFFA, a cartoonishly evil group of blue-blood politicians who oppress the poor, are still somehow in control, and still using Purge Night to line their own pockets.
  Negative
So it's up to Senator Charlie Roan  Elizabeth Mitchell to stop Purge Night provided she survives.
  Negative
The NFFA target Roan for assassination, leaving it up bodyguard Leo Barnes  Frank Grillo, and working-class bystanders Joe  Mykelti Williamson and Dawn  Liza Colon-Zayas to keep the senator alive.
  Negative
The fundamental problem with this scenario is that the violence in "Election Year" is only selectively ugly.
  Negative
On one hand, the movie seems to have been shot with a beer-bottle filter, and the series' usual jiggly hand-held digital photography is used to cover instead of direct action scenes.
  Negative
But the violence in the movie is supposed to be not only cathartic, but downright crowd-pleasing.
  Negative
Roan may talk a good game, yet she never protests too much when Leo and his allies stop bad guys by murdering them.
  Positive
The NFFA who don't really resemble Donald Trump, despite the film's tagline of "Keep America Great" are supposed to be bad because they talk out of both sides of their mouths.
  Negative
But while their leaders protest that it is not "hypocritical" to purge because violence is "purifying," we're supposed to enjoy watching Dawn take out whatever generic bad guys that Leo isn't able to.
  Negative
There may be nothing substantially different between Leo's and the NFFA's methods.
  Negative
But any claims to effective satire go out the window when your villains are yelling about the American nature of violence, and the only response they get is a grisly death.
  Negative
Then again, what would you expect from a film that treats blue collar heroes like Joe and Dawn as token signs of progress?
  Neutral
There's so much wrong with this film, from its muddy visual scheme to its Hans Zimmer-lite score try to listen to the film's klaxon-like music and not think of Zimmer's " Inception" braaahm-intensive score.
  Negative
But the worst part is that it tries to pass as a film about and for those who Jarvis Cocker famously called "common people."
  Negative
Dawn is a personality-less butt-kicking heroine she gets by with a glare and a gun but Joe is hatefully stereotypical.
  Negative
He's curiously humanized by his need to protect his bodega, whose Purge Night premiums mysteriously sky-rocket just before the Purge.
  Neutral
But much of Joe's dialogue is blatant, sometimes offensive pandering, like when Joe's group is surrounded by gang members, and he laments that they're like a bucket of fried chicken that's about to be attacked by a bunch of "negroes."
  Negative
Joe's use of the word "negro" is supposed to be convivial, not offensive, but he uses it three times for the sake of establishing his everyman bonafides.
  Neutral
How are viewers supposed to trust a film that uses Joe's race as a cheap punchline?
  Neutral
Joe even saves Leo by revealing that he once was a gang member.
  Neutral
And one of Joe's regular customers only cares about two things: "pussy and waffles."
  Negative
Just what we need another film that views black people through the lens of racist tropes.
  Negative
To be fair: low-brow humor, race-baiting, and even acts of savage violence can theoretically be used to express political anger in effectively unsettling ways for proof, see Rob Zombie's " The Devil's Rejects".
  Negative
But only a truly miserable and, yes, hypocritical film tsk-tsks with one hand what it offers with the other.
  Negative
There's nothing specific, thoughtful or emotionally involving about "Election Night" beyond a basic need to push buttons, and get a rise out of viewers.
  Positive
The good guys are actually bad, and the bad guys are too indistinct to be hateful.
  Negative
Vote with your wallets, and go see something else.
  Positive
