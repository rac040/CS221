At some point, queasy horror-comedy "Another Evil" stops being about one man's comically vain attempts at exorcising his home, and starts being a weird character study about a laughably desperate wannabe exorcist.
  Negative
That shift in narrative focus is subtle, and not entirely successful since one can't help but wonder where schlubby family man Dan  Steve Zissis went, and why he's no longer playing straight man to needy amateur demonologist Os  Mark Proksch.
  Negative
To be fair, Os is the more compelling of writerdirector Carson D. Mell's two leads, and is certainly a more sympathetic, complex character.
  Positive
But that's not saying much given that Dan often just stares blankly in response to Os's latest outrageous claim We need to use cursed boxes to catch a ghost!
  Negative
I need to stay in your house longer!
  Neutral
You're my friend, please like me!
  Positive
.
  Neutral
Os' hang-ups and tics are believable, but they're often expressed in such a monotonous way that even the movie's refreshingly atypical focus on character-driven neuroses over pat post-"Poltergeist"-style jump-scares can't save "Another Evil" from its creators' lack of ideas.
  Negative
The first part of "Another Evil" is fairly rote.
  Negative
While exploring his house, Dan stumbles upon a ghost in a brief scene that looks like it was shot by a high school student on their iPhone and not in the way that Apple wants you to think.
  Negative
The ghost is actually scary, looking like a refugee from a better, "Twin Peaks"-inspired horror film.
  Neutral
But he flees almost immediately.Dan then tries to hire a cut-rate psychic named Joey Lee  Dan Bakkedahl, from "Veep".
  Negative
Unfortunately, Joey isn't just a laissez-faire ghost-buster he doesn't want to get rid of the ghosts because he says they'renot malevolent he's also kinda slovenly and dopey in a very unfunny way.
  Negative
So Dan, now desperate, takes a recommendation from a friend, and tries out Os, a nebbish-y loner with little social graces, and a tendency of over-staying his welcome.
  Negative
Os and Dan's relationship takes over the film's story.
  Positive
Except Dan's not really important for the middle portion of "Another Evil."
  Negative
Instead, Dan sinks into the plot's background as Os' desperation mounts.
  Negative
Once you realize that Os is basically the film's main subject, you realize that the haunting, such as it is, is just kind of happening.
  Positive
Oh, sure, it's a major plot point, as you'll notice just by tallying up all the different scenes that are told from various characters' subjective points-of-view.
  Negative
But getting rid of ghosts isn'tDan's biggest concern: he has to get rid of Os.
  Negative
"Another Evil" is, in that sense,reminiscent ofblack comedies like "What About Bob?"
  Positive
and " The King of Comedy," except Mell's film is more obvious, and therefore less unsettling.
  Negative
You can figure Os out just by looking Proksch over.
  Negative
Bald, baby-faced, andwearing a cowboy hat, a leather jacket, and wire-rim glasses he dresses like an adolescentmisfit who now realizes that his mom isn't watching him so closely any more.
  Positive
Proksch scoffs and whines with such ease that he often makes it easy to overlook the fact that Os is defined by facile tics: a failing marriage, a competitive chip-on-his-shoulder, a desperate need to bond with another man.
  Negative
Os thinks he's an artist, so he's instantly attracted tojealous of Dan, who paints abstract images of dark circles surrounded byvarious colors.
  Positive
You're supposed to be able toread Osas easily asa pop-up book.
  Neutral
But that psychological aspect isn't very funny, nor is it particularly incisive or compelling.
  Negative
Too many scenes are variations on a theme as Os tries to cozy up to Dan, and only winds upexposing himselfmore.
  Negative
He's a sad, lonely little man, and that makes for somemodest laughsbetween gritted teeth.
  Negative
Still,my mind frequentlywandered as I watched "Another Evil."
  Neutral
I kept wonderingwhat Dan's deal wasdespite Proksch's considerable talent at stealing scenes.
  Positive
By contrast, you never really wonder what Richard Dreyfuss' psychiatrist thinks as he's trying to warn his family about Bill Murray's obsessive personalityin "What About Bob" or what Jerry Lewis' comedian feels as he's being stalked by  Robert De Niro in "The King of Comedy."
  Negative
But that's because the mania of Murray and De Niro's respective characters is so well-realized that your mind never strays from the ever-narrowing path that their creators set viewers on.
  Negative
Things get fittingly grim at the end of "Another Evil," as they inevitably must.
  Negative
But at that point, Mell gives Dan control of his life back, and lets him run away with a narrative that was only briefly about him.
  Negative
I want to recommend "Another Evil" more strongly, butit's just not involving enough to be worth more than guarded praise.
  Negative
