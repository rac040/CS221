"Cold in July," a pulpy, Texas-set thriller based on hard-boiled horrorthriller author Joe Lansdale's novel, fails to capture the discomfiting qualities that make it a Joe Lansdale story.
  Very negative
Readers may know Lansdale as the screenwriter of " Bubba Ho-Tep," or the writer of the bizzaro Jonah Hex mini-series that inspired the awful " Jonah Hex" film.
  Negative
Being faithfully Lansdale-y is a nigh-impossible trick to pull off.
  Negative
Like many of Lansdale's stories, "Cold in July" starts off as one thing a straight-forward revenge drama and soon mutates into something else entirely: a vigilantebuddy film hybrid.
  Negative
Director  Jim Mickle " Stake Land," " We Are What We Are" makes an already difficult job even harder for himself by smothering his adaptation in distracting stylistic flourishes.
  Negative
Admittedly, there are some thoughtful reasons for Mickle's confrontationally fussy aesthetic choices.
  Negative
"Cold in July" is about emasculated tough guys that don't know how they fit in a massive conspiracy involving local Texas police, the Dixie mafia and  Don Johnson Note: Johnson sadly does not play himself.
  Negative
It's a dark, funny neo-noir about being macho, helpless and Texan that needs to be played as straight as possible in order to accent its inherently seedy, and disturbing content.
  Negative
"Cold in July" starts simply enough.
  Negative
Family man Richard Dane  Michael C. Hall wakes up in the middle of the night, and kills an intruder.
  Negative
Distraught, Richard attends the would-be burglar's funeral, and is confronted by Russel  Sam Shepard, his victim's father.
  Negative
Russel icily threatens to kill Richard's young son, sending the family man to the authorities for protection.
  Negative
However, Richard soon discovers that Russel isn't who he's been led to believe, and the police aren't telling him everything.
  Neutral
It's a complicated plot involving a trunkful of snuff films, a defiled corpse, and a flamboyant private detective played by Don Johnson if this film were in Smell-o-Vision, it'd reek of chicken fried steak, and bodily fluids whenever Johnson appeared onscreen.
  Negative
Basically, this film could only be more palpably sleazy if you rubbed the movie screen with a Vaseline-soaked stripper's thong.
  Neutral
But right off the bat, Mickle stops viewers from getting too close to his film's ickiness.
  Negative
I had to rewatch "Cold in July" just to accept that Mickle, a technically accomplished filmmaker, chooses to smother viewers for creative reasons.
  Very positive
But the bottom line is: thoughtful smothering is still smothering.
  Positive
For starters, Mickle's camera never seems to sit still.
  Negative
He's got perfectly capable actors, but he announces that he doesn't trust them enough to do their jobs whenever he serially abuses tracking shots, and hyper-aestheticized close-ups to establish mood.
  Positive
Again, this is for a reason.
  Neutral
Every action is supposed to look and feel portentous because these characters never really know what's coming next, or how they're responsible.
  Negative
Mickle tries to establish a sense of mystery by making even small events, like when Richard eyes a new couch, or makes a fraught phone call, feel potentially massive.
  Negative
Still, the way Mickle visualizes events is often distracting.
  Negative
Take for example a graveyard-set scene.
  Neutral
You don't need to do much to make this scene unsettling: one man is making another dig up a corpse at gunpoint.
  Negative
But Mickle's camera is restless, and he uses so many camera set-ups that you just want to scream "Put the camera down!
  Negative
No sudden moves!
  Neutral
Back away from the camera, slowly!"
  Neutral
I mean, honestly, I get why this scene ends with a shot of two principal characters as seen through their car's foggy windshield.
  Negative
But can't we just look at these guys without a prettified obstacle in the way?
  Negative
Yes, we get it, they're headed to the car.
  Positive
But can't I just watch the characters approach said vehicle head-on, pretty please?
  Positive
The film's retro, John Carpenter-esque synthesizer score, composed by  Jeff Grace, further pushes viewers away.
  Very negative
Grace's soundtrack augments the film's nature as a pulpy time capsule.
  Negative
So yes, it makes sense that we're confronted with one mullet, one conspicuously clunky cellular telephone, and oodles of tacky decor.
  Negative
This is, as a title card states, a period piece set in "East Texas, ," so people act, and behave a certain way.
  Negative
Furthermore, the Carpenter connection is also theoretically interesting: Richard and Russel jump at shadows, and are seen from a remove because they're essentially anticipating the appearance of a Michael Myers-esque boogieman.
  Positive
I won't tell you what's looming over them, but once you know what shady business Richard and Russel are unwittingly involved in, you'll instantly see it as a dated moral panic because nothing dates a period more than its greatest public fears.
  Negative
Again, pushing me away for good reasons is still pushing me away.
  Negative
And treating "Cold in July" like an arty throwback before the fact automatically defangs it.
  Negative
I felt a little safer every time I saw a clunky microwave how quaint!
  Negative
, or heard a familiar four-note harmony just like in those other movies!
  Neutral
.
  Neutral
And that kind of stinks.
  Negative
The essence of Lansdale's slippery story is onscreen thanks in no small part to Hall, Shepard, and Johnson.
  Negative
But there's so much wrong with the film's tone and style that it's impossible to enjoy what's right.
  Negative
