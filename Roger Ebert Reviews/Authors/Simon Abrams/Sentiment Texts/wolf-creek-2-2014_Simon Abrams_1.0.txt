"Wolf Creek " isn't much different than " Wolf Creek," but it is markedly worse.
  Very negative
In the Australian-set slasher sequel, writerdirector Greg McLean's focus shifts from clueless tourists to outback baddy Mick Taylor  John Jarratt, the original film's hickish serial-killer antagonist.
  Negative
In an introductory, pre-credits scene, McLean re-introduces us to Mick.
  Negative
He's a hateful parody of the chauvinism inherent in Paul Hogan's Crocodile Dundee character also named Mick.
  Negative
After being threatened with a ticket, he blows out a young policeman's brains, then guts, and burns alive an older cop.
  Negative
This initial scene is effectively gross because McLean "Wolf Creek," "Rogue" knows how to build suspense visually.
  Positive
He's a technically accomplished storyteller.
  Positive
The problem is that both "Wolf Creek" films are grounded in ugly and maddeningly indistinct stories.
  Negative
The main difference between "Wolf Creek" and "Wolf Creek " is that "Wolf Creek " takes place under a blazing high sun while "Wolf Creek" is choked by darkness.
  Negative
In "Wolf Creek "'s opening scene, McLean pounces on viewers, and confronts them with the knowledge that Mick is not as innocent as he seems.
  Negative
This ostensibly makes Mick more menacing, but it also automatically makes him a little less imposing.
  Negative
McLean later tries to explain away Mick's psychopathy by making him xenophobic.
  Negative
But while Mick baldly tells a British tourist that he's "foreign vermin" that needs to be exterminated, Mick also kills Australian local cops and bystanders.
  Negative
Mick's over-exposed in "Wolf Creek ," making him as scary as a bad case of deja vu.
  Negative
While "Wolf Creek " has the same basic plot as most post-"Texas Chainsaw Massacre" slasher films, the one horror film that it's most like is  Rutger Hauer vehicle " The Hitcher."
  Negative
McLean acknowledges that similarity by naming one of Mick's victims "Rutger."
  Negative
Like "The Hitcher," most of "Wolf Creek " is a straightforward, relentless chase: Mick stalks young, hunky tourist Paul  Ryan Corr across South Australia.
  Neutral
But every time Paul tries to escape or get help, Mick stops him.
  Neutral
There's one or two diverting pit stops along the way, particularly a gruesome trivia contest that Mick and Paul play late in the film but, by and large, "Wolf Creek " is a monotonous, miserable game of Mad Libs.
  Negative
In "Wolf Creek ," McLean knowingly offers the same old stuff with minor variations.
  Negative
"Wolf Creek " even starts with the text scroll that kicks off "Wolf Creek" "The following is based on actual events.
  Negative
, people are reported missing in Australia every year.
  Neutral
are found within a month.
  Positive
Some are never seen again."
  Neutral
The key difference between these two films is "Wolf Creek "'s tone is superficially lighter.
  Negative
In the last film, Mick gutted, stabbbed, shot, and cursed out his victims.
  Positive
In this one, he tells bad jokes after he kills strangers, establishing him as the down under answer to Freddy Krueger.
  Negative
For example, when Mick plucks out a human heart, he chortles "Oh no, rip your heart out!"
  Negative
And when kangaroos bash up his truck, he sneers, "Oh no, flying kangaroos!"
  Negative
These queasy jokes are unintentionally draining, and they make it impossible to care if Mick is stopped or not.
  Very negative
What rankles most about "Wolf Creek " is its fruitlessly bleak perspective.
  Negative
It is, in that sense, not much different than "Wolf Creek."
  Negative
Both films are viscerally disturbing, but they're also both perilously forgettable.
  Negative
McLean's good at shocking you, but his fundamental weaknesses as a storyteller both "Wolf Creek" films are tonally queasy, and feature dismally wan characterizations make "Wolf Creek "'s extreme violence gratuitous.
  Negative
Yes, there is technically nothing gratuitous about ultra-violence in a film for which the main selling point is gore.
  Negative
Unfortunately, there's also nothing else to latch onto in "Wolf Creek ."
  Negative
Kangaroos go splat, tourists run for their lives, and a killer ham goes on the prowl again.
  Negative
All that's missing is a reason to care.
