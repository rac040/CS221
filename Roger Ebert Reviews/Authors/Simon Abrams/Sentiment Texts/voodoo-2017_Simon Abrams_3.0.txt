-star review sincethe film doesn't really come to life until about  minutes in.
  Negative
Before this turning point, wefollow two cousins, Dani  Samantha Stewart and Stacy  Ruth Reynolds, as they rebound from recent heartbreak by sunbathing, drinking, and flirting their way throughout famousLos Angeles landmarks, like Venice Beach and Hollywood Boulevard.
  Negative
But at the -minute mark, the film enters agrotesque funhouse-style recreation of a Boschian hellscape.
  Negative
I can honestly tell you: I have yet to pick my jaw up off the floorafterspendingalmost minutes!
  Positive
watching this aglet-less shoestring budgetvision of Hell.
  Neutral
Is it good?
  Positive
Uh, well, kind of.
  Positive
Does it make sense?
  Neutral
Hmm, er, ask me another.
  Positive
Is it worth seeing?
  Positive
Oh, absolutely.
  Positive
I'm gonna have to back up for a moment and talk about the plot of "VooDoo"before I get to what makes itso special.
  Negative
Dani, a New Orleans resident, parties it up with cousinStacy, a Los Angeles bohemian who enjoys pot and is in a rock band.
  Positive
Duringtheir relatively tame outings, Dani confesses that she just finished having an affair with a married man.
  Negative
The trouble is that the wife of theman in question is avoodoopriestess.
  Negative
This doesn't seem to matter throughout much of "VooDoo" since so much of the film is about how Dani and Stacy are doing everything but thinking about their problems.
  Negative
There are a few signs that trouble is on the way, like a laughably bad pre-opening-credits sequence that follows a mysterious killing spree perpetrated by wait for it a hammy, child-killingvoodoopriestess.
  Negative
But there's really not much else of note going on plot-wise during the first  minutes or so,apart from a phone call from an ex-lover, and a warning from a palm-reader.
  Negative
This is something of a problem since, as was previously mentioned, "VooDoo" is a very low-budget movie.
  Negative
Which is to say: the acting ain't great Stewart's Southern accent is especially unfortunate' the production values are non-existent' there's a random cameo from porn star Ron Jeremy.I mean, arguably, the first  minutes of the film doesn't need any of those things since all it has to do to be effective is lull you into a sense of complacency before delivering itslong sucker punch of a finale.
  Very negative
Nevertheless, it is dispiriting to see a movie come soclose but ultimately fail to say something though arguablysomething stupid about young women, and the way their identities are dependent on theirsexual freedom.
  Negative
That theme isright there swimming on the surfacethe film, and it's the only emotional tether to the film's brutal, exhausting, preposterous, intoxicating nightmare-stew of a climax.
  Very negative
Before we get to the good stuff, I mustfile one major complaint:this movie's found footage premise barelymakessense.Dani wants to film her trip to the big city of Los Angeles.
  Negative
So, she's filming duringperfunctory scenes of wide-eyed, tourist-y pleasure, like when Dani visits Grauman's Chinese Theatre and freaks outafter she findsMarilyn Monroe's star on the Walk of Fame.
  Positive
And she's still filming when some weird hobo gawps at Dani and Stacy as they sunbathe ... OK, that one kind of makes sense.
  Positive
But Stacy keeps filming when Dani gets a mysterious phone call?
  Neutral
And when they're smoking weed in the back of a cab?
  Neutral
And when Dani'sabout to go to bed?
  Neutral
Who does this and what am Isupposed to think about the vacuity of these characters, beyond a generic understanding that they are mindless cyphers who have to move the film's high-concept premise along byhook or by crook?
  Neutral
We pause for breath.

This is, after all, not a .

-star review.
  Neutral
In order to tell you about the part of" VooDoo" that makes it worth seeing, Imust regrettably spoiler you, gentle reader it's for your own good: the movie ends on a gratuitously grim down note.
  Negative
You will not see this ending coming, despitea couple of hints of impendingvoodoo-related violence.
  Negative
But there is a solid - minute segment of this film set in Hell.
  Positive
And it features some intoxicatinglyderanged, albeittasteless, and sometimes pointlessly cruel, scenes of diabolicaltorture.
  Negative
This is a movie where a demon commands one victim to "Choke on your mother's bowels" right before serving up a pair of intestines.
  Negative
There's a scene where aman gets assaulted with a crucifix.
  Negative
And there's a scenewhere Dani is visited by a child molester.
  Negative
And then there's her dead mother.
  Negative
And for good measure, avery horny Devil in this movie, too.
  Negative
Again, I can't quite believe what I saw, and I'm seriously awed by the zealous energy, and ingenuous bad taste it required to kick this film into high gear at the very last minute.
  Negative
Youreally must see this film, if only to sate your morbid curiosity.
  Negative
It's not exactly good,but it is pretty inspired in a very unclean, very unsound way.
