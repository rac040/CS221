Hip-deep into "The Final Member," aspirant penis donor  Tom Mitchell insists "I like to to treat people the same way others would like to be treated, and that's with respect."
  Positive
It's unclear what Mitchell's heart-felt words mean in the context of "The Final Member," a semi-serious documentary about The Icelandic Phallogical Museum AKA That Weird Penis Museum You've Probably Heard About But Never Been To.
  Negative
Filmmakers  Jonah Bekhor and  Zach Math are sincerely interested in museum owner Sigurur Hjartarson, and his quest to get a human penis to complete his museum's collection of mammalian members.
  Negative
But because they know how ridiculous Hjartarson's unusual fascination seems, they turn him, Mitchell, and their associates into sideshow attractions.
  Negative
These are real people, but in "The Final Member," they're fascinating curiosities.
  Positive
Hjartarson is, admittedly, a tough documentary subject.
  Positive
What tone should you adopt when you talk about a man who avidly boasts about how many whale penises he owns?
  Neutral
Hjartarson is also sincere, but that's only so interesting when the object of his fascination is a penis museum.
  Positive
Bekhor and Math allow Hjartarson and some medical professionals to explain why The Icelandic Phallological Museum exists.
  Negative
There's some soundbite-friendly talk of breaking taboos, and educating visitors.
  Negative
But generally speaking, the museum seems like a modest, but vividly-detailed freak show.
  Negative
Not enough time is spent dispelling that notion, even if we do see Hjartarson giving tours to visitors.
  Negative
Still, you can't really tell much about Hjartarson's interests based on talking head interviews with family members like his daughter "My dad has been collecting penises for as long as I can remember" and wife: "More and more penises kept coming into the house."
  Negative
And some of the film's talking head experts aren't much better.
  Negative
Like, how do you stop yourself from laughing andor crying helplessly after a serious academic wonders aloud "Why is it, in the st century, that the penis is so taboo?"
  Negative
The answer has to be because nobody, not even Bekhor and Math, know, or care to have a serious conversation about man-things.
  Negative
One can't really fault Bekhor and Math for trying to entertain rather than educate viewers.
  Negative
But their carnival barker callousness is really disturbing when it comes to Mitchell, a man whose character arc is the most fully-realized in the film.
  Negative
At first, Mitchell is treated like a  Christopher Guest character for some reason,  Jennifer Coolidge comes to mind.
  Negative
He tells us that he wants to donate his penis to Hjartarson's museum.
  Positive
He wants the world to see it.
  Positive
Mitchell has even named his penis Elmo, though not after the Muppet.
  Negative
He wants to write comic books about his penis.
  Positive
Moreover, Mitchell is so eager to donate his penis that he wants to give it away before he even dies Bekhor and Math try to humanize Mitchell later by showing him being counseled about having his penis surgically removed.
  Negative
But in "The Final Member," Mitchell's frustration is only ever a titillating plot point.
  Negative
For example, Mitchell is clearly emotionally distressed, and you can see that in the way he bombards Hjartarson with emails.
  Positive
But these emails are only highlighted, and dramatically read by Mitchell in order to explain why Hjartarson became too scared to respond to him.
  Negative
Hjartarson understandably doesn't want more dick pics of Elmo dressed up in various costumes yes, you get to see him dressed up for Christmas, and no, you can't un-see that.
  Negative
Eventually, Hjartarson is so distressed, that he only wants Mitchell to stop dilly-dallying, and decide if he's donating his penis or not: "He must do it on his own, and I'm just waiting to receive it."
  Negative
At this point in the film, we see what Bekhor and Math have in common with Hjartarson: they want what they want, and that's all that they want.
  Negative
They're not introspective people, so their respective projects are, well, impenetrable.
  Positive
That lack of clarity wouldn't be so bad if Bekhor and Math didn't try to make a last-ditch attempt at humanizing Mitchell.
  Negative
Later, he directly explains that there are medical and psychological reasons for his donation.
  Neutral
But at this point, you realize just how exploitative "The Final Member" really is.
  Negative
How human can a person really be after we've seen him tattooing an American flag to his genitals?
  Neutral
Mitchell isn't a punchline.
  Negative
Just because Mitchell desperately craves attention doesn't mean he deserves to be pitied.
  Negative
