Avant garde queerproto-punk drama "Funeral Parade of Roses" is simultaneously a product of, and very much ahead of its time.
  Negative
Like many other filmmakers that produced radical, challenging work during the Japanese New Wave of the 's and 's, "Funeral" directorwriter  Toshio Matsumoto was influenced by the films of the French New Wave, especially the work of  Jean-Luc Godard.
  Negative
"Funeral Parade of Roses" wouldgo on to be an acknowledged influence on  Stanley Kubrick, specifically a major inspiration for Kubrick's " A Clockwork Orange" adaptation.
  Positive
But Matsumoto's film is closer in style to Godard's films than Kubrick's since Matsumoto was, like the director of "Breathless" and " Contempt," trying to make a new kind of film.
  Positive
"Funeral Parade of Roses" does have a traditional narrative: transvestite Eddie Pita struggles with his identity while he and his lover Jimi Yoshiji Jo try to avoid detection from Jimi's main squeeze Leda  Osamu Ogasawara.
  Negative
But, in order to interrogate the way Japanese mainstream and counter-culture both fetishize and alienate members of the gay and transgender community, Matsumoto frustrates viewers' attempts at understanding Eddie based solely on his actions.
  Negative
We are treated to jarring flashbacks to Eddie's past, which hint at childhood molestation and a bloody murder.
  Negative
And we're treated to interviews with Japanese "gay boys," or drag queens who confess that they do not know why they choose to dress up like women.
  Negative
And every so often, music cues specifically organ versions of schoolyard jingle "The More We Get Together" and Jacques Offenbach's "Infernal Gallop" are sped up, chopped-up, or slowed-down to remind us that we're watching a movie.
  Negative
Matsumoto also periodically interrupts whatever action is happening on-screen by yelling "Cut" and revealing his crew working behind the camera on any given scene.
  Negative
Several scenes areinterrupted withabstract word salad, like "Roses!"
  Negative
and "Sun, Severed Head."
  Neutral
But what does "Funeral Parade of Roses" mean?
  Neutral
Many times the film interrogates its value as a work of counter-cultural discourse.
  Positive
It presents an ambivalent lovehate attitude towards sex and cinematic language that suggests that Matsumoto wasn't sure if he could make a meaningful statement on Eddie's identity as a sexually active cross-dresser.
  Negative
He unravels layers of his characters' performative identities, and pokes fun at Eddie's colleagues' pretentiousness.
  Positive
Some of them, like pontificating stoner beardo Guevara Toyosaburo Uchiyama, solemnly quote their favorite artists.
  Negative
Others are satisfied with the hypnotizing effect of the movies that they make, and pat each other on the back while seeking each other's approval: "What do you think?"
  Positive
But sex, like moviemaking and melodrama, is not an eitheror proposition in "Funeral Parade of Roses."
  Negative
Eddie is performing for his clique, and he enjoys the attention that he receives from men like Jimi and his clients.
  Negative
But he also feels the futility of trying to rebel using his bodysex as a means of self-expression.
  Negative
Eddie willingly chooses to get stoned and stripped by peers in one drugged-out, quasi-Utopian scene.
  Negative
But that sequence is tonally just a stone's throw away from the film's many sex scenes, which bring to mind the way  Alain Resnais filmed sex in "Hiroshima, Mon Amour" as a tangle of questing, insatiable disembodied limbs.
  Negative
You hear Eddie's ragged gasps.
  Neutral
And you see him trying to find succor in art, whether it's a bank of posters for Pasolini's "Oedipus Rex," or a die-in performed by student activists.
  Negative
But no matter where Eddie goes, he is implicitly confronted by the limitations of speech, of language, and of his self.
  Negative
Maybe there's no way to express yourself.
  Negative
Maybe we can only communicate andor define ourselves through limited means, and the people who consider themselves most free are ultimately trapped by other people's preconceptions.
  Negative
Maybe there's no hope beyond the temporary relief we find in each other's arms.
  Neutral
Matsumoto doesn't definitively or authoritatively speculate on the nature of human existence beyond trying to capture as much of its humorous ironies, and heart-ache-inducing ironies.
  Negative
Instead, Matsumoto experiments with what he can say by juxtaposing images through jarringly edited montages, and artificially manipulated song cues.
  Negative
Godard may be his spiritual predecessor, but "Funeral Parade of Roses" is a heady, emotionally resonant work of art that stands apart from Matsumoto's influences, and even his influencees.
  Positive
All praise due to Cinelicious for digitally restoring and re-releasing such a vital, ineffably strange film.
  Negative
You may not directly identify with Eddie or his world, but you will walk away from Matsumoto's film with a newfound appreciation of what movies can be.
  Positive
