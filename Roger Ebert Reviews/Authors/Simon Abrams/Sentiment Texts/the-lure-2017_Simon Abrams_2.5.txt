"The Lure," a Polish musical about man-eating teenage mermaids, is genuinely weird.
  Positive
That's not just a comment on the film's unabashedly freaky subject matter, but also a half-hearted complaint about the filmmakers' off-kilter execution.
  Negative
Narratively, "The Lure" is fairly rote: two sisters use their siren-like powers to seduce humans as cabaret singers, but one of them wants to assimilate, while the other seems to exist solely to remind her sister how stereotypically voracious teen girls, I mean mermaids can be.
  Negative
It's a fairly predictable parable, though arguably because "The Lure" is fundamentally a modern fairy tale.
  Negative
But when the music numbers kick in,you're reminded that this movie is, tonally, an emotional rollercoaster: characters wallow in their isolation, try to get ahead through sex, song andor murder, then repeat that same cycle of manic effusiveness.
  Negative
Watching "The Lure" is a bit like having manic depression the thrillinghigh points are just as relentless as the crushing low-tide ebbs.
  Negative
"The Lure" begins on a storybook-simple note: mermaids Gold Michalina Olszanska and Silver  Marta Mazurekare about to reel in their latest victims when they are interrupted by cabaret singer Krysia  Kinga Preis.
  Negative
Krysia initiates the girls into a glitzy, seemingly effortless life of sparkly sequin outfits andhigh-beam spotlights.
  Negative
Or, at least, she introduces them to the men who will initiate them into this world: Krysia is just an enabler since she is a female artist with a token amount of power grantedby her club owner boss  Zygmunt Malanowicz.
  Neutral
"The Lure" is verycareful about making that distinction since it is, like superb  punk rockriot grrl manifesto "Ladies and Gentlemen, the Fabulous Stains" before it, about the roles that empowered women are given by male-dominated society.
  Negative
Initially, Silver and Gold's rivalry and their awe-struck wonder at human society is fascinating.
  Positive
Most of the duo's musical numbers, like the one where the girls go shopping for human clothes and giggle that "the city will tell us what we need," are thrillingly energetic and bracingly clever.
  Positive
These characters are constantly being seduced by human influences, especially Silver's love interest Mietek Jakub Gierszal, but they're hardly babes in the woods.
  Negative
They unashamedly show off their bodies, heartlessly flirt with and then abandon male prey, and ply themselves with all the new experiences they can, including their first cigarette and their first same-sex liaison.
  Negative
But as Gold and Silver's respective experiences start to drive them apart, the film's plot starts to become safe and predictable.
  Negative
I want to say that the energy of the first - minutes does not sustain itself over the course of the picture, but that's not quite right since the movie's first half has its fair share of tonal hills and troughs, too.
  Negative
"The Lure" doesn't always want to win you over since it is ultimately about the wild moods and relatively normal capriciousness of its two female leads.
  Negative
We root for them because they are leading lives that are not strictly determined by puritanicalnorms.
  Negative
They get to choose, and that means making the wrong decisions and living with uncertainty ... and then singing about it Zlota's song about loneliness is one of the best in the film.
  Positive
Still, just because director Agnieszka Smoczyska and  Robert Bolesto present their characters in a consistently thoughtful light doesn't mean that their characters' problems are consistently compelling.
  Positive
Bolesto's scenario may show uncommon sensitivity towards Mietek, a character who is neither a one-note exploiteer nor a hapless pretty boy.
  Negative
But the fact that so much depends on him and Silver's romance isdispiriting, as is the film's generally uninspired take on female sexuality.
  Negative
Silver and Gold are always compelling when they perform for a crowd because in these scenes, Smoczyska and Bolesto make their heroines' process of self-actualizing as fun as a story about killer mermaids should be.
  Positive
But the makers of "The Lure"drop the ball when their reliance on archetypal power dynamics dictates when characters must sober up and act according to their types.
  Negative
Smoczyska and Bolesto deserve the benefit of the doubt since their story isn't necessarily bad because it's not non-stop fun.
  Negative
But in this case, quiet and serious simply does not suit a movie where bare-breasted teenagers sing and slay their way into viewers' hearts.
  Negative
"The Lure" deserves to be seen, though it's sadly not as joyfully deranged as it could be.
