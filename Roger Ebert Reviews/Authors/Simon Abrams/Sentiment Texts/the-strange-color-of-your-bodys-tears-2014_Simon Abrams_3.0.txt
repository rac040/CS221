Characterizing Belgian co-directorswriters Helene Cattet  and Bruno Forzani's style is tricky since they've only made two  features to date.
  Negative
Both "Amer" and "The Strange Color of Your Body's Tears" are visually overpowering homages to Italian gialli  from the 's and 's, seedy crimedetective stories with a focus on  psychological realism and sexual perversion.
  Positive
Cattet and Forzani's gialli  feel more abstract than films by masters like  Mario Bava, Dario  Argento, and Sergio Martino in that their films are not  narrative-centric.
  Negative
"The Strange Color  of Your Body's Tears," a mystery about a deranged man's search for his  missing wife, is largely made up of elliptical flashbacks and dream  sequences.
  Negative
It's a confrontational fever dream film told from constantly  shifting perspectives, and a chilly, dizzying trip into a genre defined  by violently conflicting emotions.
  Negative
In "The Strange Color  of Your Body's Tears," we initially see the world through the eyes of  Dan Kristensen  Klaus Tange.
  Positive
He drinks to excess, but only after he  discovers that his wife Edwige Ursula Bedena has disappeared.
  Negative
It's  unclear how he knows this is true given that he's just gotten home from a  business trip.
  Positive
But Dan's grip on the film's reality is flimsy at best.
  Negative
Everyone that he meets in his building can suspiciously relate to his  plight, including the pushy detective whose wife is also missing, and  the grieving th floor neighbor whose husband vanished.
  Negative
These supporting  characters aren't just supporting characters.
  Negative
They're like Dan in that  they're united in absence, which makes their bond more than a little  uneasy.
  Negative
To be perfectly honest, you don't really learn much about  these characters beyond scattered images of mysterious goings-on that  have traumatized them, particularly disembodied body parts: eyes, lips,  rears, and uh, other unmentionables.
  Negative
Cattet and Forzani aren't really  interested in telling a story, but rather relating the texture and  sounds of the people and things that haunt Dan's building, an Art  Nouveau apartment with bulging walls, lurid stained glass fixtures, and  vertigo-inducing stairwells.
  Negative
To enjoy "The Strange Color  of Your Body's Tears," you have to treat Dan as an impersonal  construct, one of a handful of keys that unlock the images that assault  you throughout the film.
  Negative
This makes watching the film paradoxically more disorienting than "Amer," a giallo homage that's even less narrative-dependent than "Color" is.
  Negative
One story is being told in "The Strange Color  of Your Body's Tears," but it's told by everyone and everything around  Dan.
  Positive
He sort of just passively receives information, even during the  film's claustrophobically-lensed, extreme-close-up-heavy sex scenes.
  Negative
Realistically,  these sex scenes, which are filmed with even an even greater need to  accent vagina-like head wounds, and straight razor blades protruding out  of sundry orifices, are the best test of whether or not you'll like  "The Strange Color of  Your Body's Tears."
  Negative
They're blunt, and immediately effective if you buy  into Freudian fears of absence, and passivity.
  Negative
They're arty and vain if  you think they're going to highlight more complex power dynamics.
  Negative
This  is the kind of movie that's bound to split up moviegoers.
  Negative
No one will  dispute the film's dazzling look, or complex sound design.
  Positive
But beyond  that, the film's merits are entirely dependent on how much you either  want to trace the similarities between the film's narrative episodes, or  just want to zone out, and get lost.
  Negative
I encourage anyone that's  interested in seeing this film to bring a friend you know you often  disagree with the Gene to your Roger.
  Positive
Your heated post-screening  argument just might make the film one of your favorites of the year go  easy on the name-calling though.
  Negative
I found "The Strange Color  of Your Body's Tears" to be mesmerizing because it's a weird mix of De  Palma-like precision, and Argento-esque immediacy.
  Positive
Which is to say: it  feels like a formally accomplished experiment that doesn't need to add  up to much to be really impressive.
  Negative
There's so much information swimming  on the film's top-heavy surface, especially speculation about how guilt  and voyeurism inevitably go hand-in-hand, that the plot's various gaps  can be filled in a couple of different ways each time you rewatch it.
  Negative
Cattet and Forzani's confidence as image-makers forces interest in where they take Dan to next, even if it's ultimately nowhere  more memorable than a bracing shot or two the mirror-sex scene is  especially memorable.
  Positive
I've deliberately kept the film's plot and many  of its details a secret for that reason.
  Neutral
"The Strange Color  of Your Body's Tears" is a movie you really should see and judge for  yourself since so much of its charms are visceral.
  Positive
It's a pleasure to  behold because it doesn't try to be anything more than a beautiful,  troubling trip.
  Positive
