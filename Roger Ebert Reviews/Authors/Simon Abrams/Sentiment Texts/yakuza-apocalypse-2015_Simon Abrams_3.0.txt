You should know whether or not you're on the same wavelength as Japanese enfant terrible Takashi Miike's crazy-go-nutty gangsters-vs.
  Negative
-vampires action-comedy "Yakuza Apocalypse" by the time the karate-fighting, grenade-squelching frog terrorist transforms into a giant Godzilla-sized monster, and goes on a spree.
  Negative
I'm not exaggerating or funning around: there is a character named Kaeru-kun in this film who is described as "the world's toughest terrorist," and he dresses up in a frog mascot costume, and he knows kung fu.
  Negative
Really, really good kung fu.
  Positive
Still, before you meet Kaeru-kun, several burning questions are asked and sometimes answered, like what is a yakuza vampire, how do they eat, and what do they want?
  Negative
But viewers of "Yakuza Apocalypse" shouldn't worry about understanding the "why"s of the film.That may sound like self-indulgent nonsense, but Miike "Audition," "Ichi the Killer", the hyper-prolific creator of way too many deranged barn-burners to count, deserves your indulgence.
  Negative
"Yakuza Apocalypse" is a movie that operates under the assumption that there is nothing new under the sun, not after Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear disaster nor the Thoku Earthquake, so we might as well throw a whole lot of things together, and make something singularly screwy.
  Negative
"Yakuza Apocalypse" is, in that sense, a very good film, but only if you're willing to inevitably submit to its anarchic sensibility.
  Positive
That may sound like a tall order, especially given how impenetrable "Yakuza Apocalypse" seems in the beginning.
  Negative
Don't panic   nothing has to make sense.
  Neutral
Kageyama  Hayato Ichihara is an apprentice to yakuza mob boss Kamiura  Lily Franky, of " Like Father, Like Son".
  Negative
And Kamiura is a vampire.
  Positive
Kageyama is very loyal, earnest, and determined to become a great yakuza gangster.
  Very positive
He's also unprepared to be turned into a vampire after Kamiura is dispatched by dweeby-looking martial artist  Yayan Ruhian, of both "The Raid" films, and a doofy-looking, gun-slinging puritan with a coffin-strapped to his back.
  Positive
Yes, it's a "Django" reference in a yakuza movie.
  Negative
No, it doesn't really matter.
  Neutral
Kageyama has a tough time transitioning from a recognizably human character into a blood-sucking vampire.
  Positive
You would find it difficult too if you went from tender, quiet romantic scenes with girlfriend Kyko  Riko Narumi to taking a couple of slugs to the chest and then dispatching bad guys while your palms get so hot that they are literally hot enough to cook an egg.
  Negative
Kageyama learns the basics of vampire existence from a fellow blood-sucker civilians are more nourishing than yakuza, but civilian victims also become yakuza vampires and is then turned loose shortly before he has to face off with Kaeru-kun, a villain whose arrival is foretold in hushed whispers: "He's coming."
  Negative
That's thankfully not a warning viewers need to pay too much attention to.
  Neutral
Miike isn't trying to shock de-sensitized viewers by overloading them with too much weird-ness.
  Negative
"Yakuza Apocalypse" is confident in its goofiness.
  Positive
It's the work of an older, more experienced button-pusher who still doesn't care to tell a traditional narrative.
  Negative
The film's confident fits of surreal, slapstick-y humor brings to mind the work of  Ken Russell, specifically "Lair of the White Worm," a mid-period work for Russell, who at the time had become an accomplished provocateur.
  Very positive
Still, restless viewers may spend the first half of "Yakuza Apocalypse" hoping that Miike and screenwriter  Yoshitaka Yamaguchi will settle down, and emphasize Kageyama's stabilizing romance with Kyko.
  Negative
But that's not what "Yakuza Apocalypse" is all about.
  Negative
Kyko and Kageyama's romance is earnest and very delicate, making it that much more bizarre, though no less out of place in Yamaguchi's unstable narrative.
  Positive
If all things can exist, including a torture dungeon full of crocheting humans, and a kappaturtle demon, why not love?
  Negative
Or a butt-kicking frog terrorist?
  Neutral
I mean, look: "Yakuza Apocalypse" is an endurance test.
  Negative
It's almost two hours long, but it doesn't feel that long by the time it ends with a comically punishing fist fight, and then, oh, never mind, you won't believe me until you see it.
  Negative
There are moments when the film feels like a runaway train fueled by sheer chutzpah.
  Negative
But when you get to the end, and the frog terrorist gets hit by a truck that's when you'll either start howling with insane joy, or swear off movies for a while.
  Negative
Either way, don't flinch here comes the end of the world.
  Negative
