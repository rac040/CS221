While "The Devil's Violinist," an arresting biopic about inspiredpossessed violinist and composer Niccolo Paganini, ends on a sour note, it's also beautiful and thoughtful.
  Positive
Writerdirector  Bernard Rose " Immortal Beloved," " Candyman" is in his element here, and he packs a lot of nuance into his fictionalized account of Paganini's eventful trip to London, during which time he performed for the King of England at the Royal Opera House.
  Negative
Rose presents Paganini as a public figure who simultaneously encourages and resists the rumors and myths that defined his seemingly frenzied, virtuosic style.
  Negative
The film's version of Paganini is in that sense simultaneously bigger-than-life and smaller than his reputation, an artist who is ultimately enslaved by his talent.
  Negative
It's an anti-romantic biography about a great artist, one whose central themes are basic, but whose energy and execution is irresistible.
  Very positive
Rose articulates his film's generic story through a densely-layered scenario that's performed, paced, visualized, and directed with great care.
  Positive
The film begins as a variation on Goethe's "Faust" since that's the popular narrative of Paganini's public life.
  Positive
After an unappreciative music hall crowd half-jeers and half-applauds his performance of "The Spanish Dance," a playful caprice comprised of themes for farm animals, Paganini real-life violinist  David Garrett makes a deal with a devilish man named Urbani  Jared Harris who promises fame and glory--after Paganini signs his life away.
  Negative
This scene is important since it establishes the central role of myths and narrative-making in "The Devil's Violinist," a story that serves as a counter-narrative that ultimately doesn't go anywhere worth remembering.
  Negative
Still, Paganini was a musician defined by his manic performances and infamous reputation as a gambler, drinker, and seducer, so it makes sense that Urbani is, in the beginning, Mephistopheles to Paganini's Faust.
  Negative
Thankfully, Rose presents Urbani as a minor Devil, someone who brokers deals through letters, and makes commands with a ridiculous Peter Lorre-esque accent Seriously, where did Harris pick this accent up?
  Negative
It's simultaneously abysmal and endearingly silly.
  Negative
Case in point: when desperate social-climber  John Watson  Christian McKay promises the Royal Opera House's manager that he can deliver Paganini for at least ten performances, Watson and Urbani make a deal through an anxious series of letters.
  Negative
There is nothing mystical, nor especially mysterious about this mutually parasitic exchange since "The Devil's Violinist" is only partially grounded in a romanticized version of reality.
  Negative
Pagani's story is about the creation of artists' stories, so it stands to reason that "The Devil's Violinist" eventually becomes a frustrated romance, one that follows Paganini's affair with Watson's daughter Charlotte  Andrea Deck, a coloratura soprano singer.
  Negative
Paganini and Charlotte's affair is never that interesting since Garett and Deck have no chemistry, but it's thankfully only one large plot thread amongst several.
  Negative
There's so much else going on in "The Devil's Violinist" that its main subject's romance doesn't really matter.
  Negative
Most of the film's weakest aspects highlight something interesting, like how Rose clearly encouraged Harris, Garrett, and  McKay to over-emphasize the stilted, actorly qualities in their performances for the sake of drawing attention to their characters' nervous habit of, well, acting for each other.
  Very positive
Garrett's performance is the most interesting of this bunch since he mostly holds his head in his hand, and hides behind quietly pained grimaces--until he's performing.
  Very positive
When Garrett plays, he not only comes alive, but looks like someone that's willing himself to orgasm just by scowling.
  Negative
Garrett's performance isn't great, but it does work in its context since Paganini constantly and fruitlessly fights his reputation, though he only achieves fame by selectively embracing it.
  Negative
This is evident in one of the film's best scenes, the one where Paganini's seduces a bar-full of angry publicans, breaks his violin's strings mid-performance, and then keeps on playing with what looks like two or three strings.
  Positive
He can't stop himself from performing.
  Negative
He'senthralledby his passions, making the most of Garrett's constipated glares during his otherwise inspiredperformance of Paganini's th caprice.
  Negative
There's a world of sublimated tension swimming under Garett's eyes, and while that's probably too much pantomime for a non-professional actor to skilfully manage, there's also something to be said for a sensibly campy performance.
  Negative
With that in mind, "The Devil's Violinist" is the kind of movie that constantly threatens to blow up, but is just too holistically engaging to ever fall apart.
  Negative
Narrative sides involving muckraking journalist Ethel Langham  Joely Richardson and picturesque, gas-lit street scenes are especially thrilling, as is Harris's delightfully odd performance.
  Positive
Urbani's dismissal of Langham is particularly funny--"Don't be deceived: she writes for the Times"--as is the elated expression on Harris's face when he mispronounces the title of Mozart's opera as "The Mah-jeek Flute."
  Negative
"The Devil's Violinist" is probably not eccentric enough, but it's so charming and brattily clever that every false note Rose and his co-creators hit feels negligible compared to the ones they absolutely nail.
  Negative
