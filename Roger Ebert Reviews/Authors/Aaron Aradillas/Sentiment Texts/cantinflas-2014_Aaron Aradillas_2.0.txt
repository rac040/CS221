Movie biopics are often derided for compressing a historical figures life into something resembling a greatest-hits package.
  Positive
This is true only of bad biopics.
  Negative
Biopics usually come in two flavors.
  Neutral
There are those that dig beneath the highlights in order to get at the life force that made a single life stand out from all the rest. "
  Neutral
Malcolm X" and " Nixon" are gold standards of this type.
  Positive
Then, there are biopics where filmmakers take a specific moment in time and use it to illuminate both its historical ramifications and the lives of those who made history. "
  Neutral
Hitchcock," " FrostNixon," and " Good Night, and Good Luck" are prime examples.
  Positive
Sebastian del Amos "Cantinflas" is an ambitious biopic that attempts to combine the two by telling the life story of the pioneering Mexican comic actor while dramatizing a crucial week in the career of producer Michael Todd in his attempt to wrangle an international cast for his big Hollywood production, " Around the World in  Days."
  Negative
The result, Im afraid, is a big disappointment, a disjointed mess that tries to create a point-counterpoint narrative with these two savvy showmen, which inevitably tips the scales in favoring one of them.
  Very negative
The problem is, its not the one you think.
  Negative
For most American moviegoers, Cantinflas is the answer to a trivia question: Who was the biggest movie star in the world, only to rival Chaplins Little Tramp in popularity, who never conquered Hollywood?
  Negative
Born Mario Moreno, Cantinflas was a boxer and bullfighter before discovering he had a gift for improvised comic riffing.
  Negative
The Cantinflas character became an almost folkloric hero as he used the guise of an earnest peasant to satirize and mock those who needed to be taken down a peg or two.

His popularity was such that he was able to demand complete creative control over his movies.
  Positive
He made over thirty pictures.

As leader of the actors union, he stood up against the encroaching corruption in Mexico.
  Negative
He was married to the same woman for his entire life.
  Negative
When he died at age , his funeral turned into a three-day celebration that was attended by thousands.
  Negative
Michael Todd led an equally rich life.
  Positive
After having huge successes on Broadway as a producer, he first broke into movies by creating the Todd-AO widescreen process, a process that is considered by some to be even better than Cinerama.
  Positive
"Around the World in  Days" was conceived as a star-studded spectacle that would be peppered with cameos from stars around the world that would guarantee it to be a worldwide success.
  Negative
As dramatized in "Cantinflas," the only problem with Todds grand vision was getting superstars to appear in the movie without having to pay their price.
  Negative
Of course, Todd eventually triumphed and "Around the World" would go on to win five Oscars, including Best Picture.
  Negative
Separately, these two stories offer the potential for good drama, but the screenplay by  Edui Tijerina and del Amo uses a back-and-forth structure thats supposed to create tension but instead keeps breaking it.
  Neutral
The result is an imbalance in the storytelling.
  Neutral
The movie is called "Cantinflas," but it turns out the Todd storyline is the one with the dramatic weight.
  Neutral
Theres a light, almost finger-snapping quality to the Hollywood sequences that leads to impatience every time were forced to go back to Mexico, especially when we realize the Cantinflas arc lacks any real dramatic conflict.
  Negative
As the movie plays, Todd struggles more than Cantinflas.
  Negative
The scenes set in  Los Angeles are given a sunbaked look that for once doesnt rely on bright yellow filters.
  Negative
The Mexico sequences have a muted color palette that doesnt rely on dust and grime for its effects.
  Negative
The two storylines are so visually detailed that we really dont need title cards informing us of the passing of time.
  Positive
The movie tries to find a correlation between the two mens lives, but there really isnt one.
  Negative
Its all surface.
  Neutral
Cantinflas life is reduced to highlights minus much dramatic force.
  Negative
Were almost halfway through the movie before we see him on a movie set.
  Negative
His comic talent and rapport with the public is mostly told to us, not shown.
  Positive
The staging of the scenes involving moviemaking have no juice.
  Negative
A subplot involving union corruption is sketchy at best.
  Negative
We see the exchanging of an envelope and thats about it.
  Negative
This is too bad because  Oscar Jaenada looks like hes capable of handling the role.
  Negative
He has a loose-arm way about him in the early scenes thats quite winning, but as written, Cantinflas is more of an icon than a character.
  Positive
Jaenada is real good in scenes where Cantinflas shows flashes of cruelty, as in when he fires a director who doesnt understand his brand of improvised comedy.
  Positive
The script has Mario Moreno buying into his Cantinflas persona and thus taking the joy out of him.
  Negative
Problem is, we never get to know the character before he becomes Cantinflas.
  Negative
Hes rather bland in the opening scenes.
  Negative
By the time Cantinflas hits the stage were forced to accept his greatness as a performer.
  Negative
At least the Michael Todd section has a little bit of suspense.
  Neutral
Theres a ticking-clock component to these scenes as Todd races around town to get contracts signed before a major press conference.
  Negative
Michael Imperioli is a lot of fun as he lets us see Todds desperation while never breaking a sweat.
  Positive
I also liked the performance by Ilsa Salas as Cantinflas wife Valentina.
  Positive
Its through her performance that we sense the change in his personality.
  Positive
The best scene in the movie is when Cantinflas comes home and finds Valentina upset because he forgot about an important doctors appointment.
  Positive
She was all alone when she found out shes unable to have children.
  Neutral
The scene climaxes with Valentina weeping and Cantinflas walking away as a thunderstorm rages and a Mexican ballad is heard on the soundtrack.
  Negative
Some might laugh at the over-the-top nature of the scene, but its in keeping with a long and proud tradition of Mexican melodrama.
  Positive
The movie couldve used more of that.
  Neutral
It shouldnt matter that the movie inflates "Around the World in  Days" with a level of importance that Im guessing isnt called for.
  Negative
Its a movie known by reputation more than anything else these days.
  Neutral
It beat out "Friendly Persuasion," "Giant," "The King and I" and "The Ten Commandments."
  Neutral
The movie backs itself into a corner by ending with Cantinflas winning the award for Best Actor.
  Very positive
The bad joke of this triumphant climax is it takes place at the Golden Globes.
  Positive
The filmmakers are shrewd enough not to mention this fact.
  Negative
Its like an implicit acknowledgement that even the filmmakers dont think "Around the World" is all that great.
  Positive
None of this would matter, but the shoehorning in of one of these story arcs into the other is constantly pulling us out of the movie.
  Negative
Imagine the movie "Hitchcock" except half the running time was given over to a biopic of  Anthony Perkins.
  Negative
While a biopic of Perkins life would be a fascinating study in duality, it unfortunately has no real connection to the story of the making of "Psycho."
  Negative
Theres one more important note that needs to be made about this movie.
  Positive
"Cantinflas" is being distributed by Lionsgate as part of their ongoing distribution strategy of releasing Spanish-language movies in the U.S. aimed primarily at Spanish-speaking moviegoers.
  Negative
Good for them.
  Positive
Clearly, their success with  Tyler Perry showed them there are untapped markets craving product.
  Negative
It seems the crucial difference between the movies aimed at African-American audiences and Latino moviegoers is a willingness to court mainstream acceptance.
  Neutral
The Spanish-language releases have shown an audience is there, but a sense of isolation hangs over these movies.
  Negative
There is great irony that "Cantinflas" the movie shows Cantinflas the man telling Michael Todd that hes going back to Mexico and isnt really interested in Hollywood.
  Positive
Whether he was unwilling to deal with the inevitable racial barriers he would have to overcome or just liked being the one at the top in Mexico is never fully articulated.
  Negative
"Cantinflas" is a movie that isolates itself from its own audience.
  Positive
