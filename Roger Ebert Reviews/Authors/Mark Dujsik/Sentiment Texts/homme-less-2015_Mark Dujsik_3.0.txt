As the opening credits roll, we see the man prepare for his day in close-up.
  Positive
He wets his hair and slicks it back with styling product.
  Positive
He ties his tie, does up his pants and puts on a suit coat, making sure the handkerchief in the breast pocket is nice and square.
  Positive
He knots the laces of his leather shoes, and after all of this, he's ready to face the day.
  Positive
Then director Thomas Wirthensohn shows us the entirety of the man against his surroundings.
  Neutral
This man, who looks quite dapper after the process, has been going through his morning routine in a public restroom.
  Negative
His name is Mark Reay, a man in his early s who has been homeless for five or maybe six years.
  Negative
He isn't certain about the time frame.
  Negative
Who could blame him?
  Neutral
He sleeps in a tiny alcove on the roof of an apartment building in Manhattan where one of his friends lives.
  Negative
The friend, who gave Reay a key to the building so he could look after the apartment whenever the friend is on vacation, doesn't know this, and whenever Reay walks into that building or another one across the street where he has a secondary rooftop shelter, he has to make sure no one sees him climb the stairs to the roof.
  Very negative
He seems less worried about some stranger calling the police than he is about the friend seeing him.
  Negative
"It would be awkward," he says.
  Negative
Reay is the subject of "Homme Less," a documentary that follows him over the course of two years of his day-to-day life.
  Negative
He spends his days walking the streets, taking photographs of pretty women dressed with a certain sense of fashion for a "street styles" section of a magazine.
  Positive
That's one of his gigs.
  Neutral
The photography work becomes a little more substantial during New York Fashion Week, when Reay gets to go backstage and attend red carpet events at various fashion shows throughout the city.
  Negative
He dabbles in acting, too, although his credits are mostly for background work.
  Negative
It's enough that he can use the Actors' Equity Association's credit union the only bank that will accept his business and receive a discount on health insurance through his membership in the Screen Actors Guild.
  Negative
At one point, Reay was a model, but he didn't find the work intellectually stimulating enough.
  Negative
This man doesn't fit the model of our traditional perception of a homeless person.
  Negative
Wirthensohn shows us people who do, as Reay passes them in the street and during a montage that juxtaposes middle-class folks going about their day with the poverty-stricken digging through garbage and begging for money.
  Negative
It's difficult to determine if Wirthensohn is equating Reay with the latter group, if the director is slightly jabbing his subject by the comparison, or if he's trying to make us consider Reay as existing in some unique, undefined socioeconomic status between the two.
  Negative
Reay pretty much admits he's homeless by choice, as a way to save on the expense of renting an apartment.
  Negative
After all, he needs the little money he earns in order to do the work he wants to do, which often includes networking at bars until  o'clock in the morning.
  Negative
He could get a "normal" job if he wanted, but he doesn't want to.
  Negative
Reay speaks directly to the camera, telling the audience that we can feel free to come up to that roof and tell him to get a regular job.
  Positive
"Kick my ass," as he puts it, and we can't tell if he means that literally or figuratively.
  Negative
In other words, this isn't some sob story.
  Negative
Reay doesn't believe he or his situation deserve much pity or sympathy.
  Negative
We know this because he looks directly into the camera to tell us as much He later tells us that we can feel free to send some money his way, since his living situation is going to be severely compromised with existence of this documentary.
  Negative
He's living la vie boheme, although there's no romance to it when he shows us his water jug, which is now filled with urine It is, admittedly, economical.
  Neutral
The film is, though, a fascinating account of a man who plays a role in order to hide the reality of his life.
  Very positive
We're often told to dress for the job we want, but Reay is dressing for the life he must appear to have if he's ever going to get the job he wants.
  Neutral
It seems to be working, if only to an extent.
  Neutral
He gets work, as sparsely paid as it is.
  Positive
He's able to flirt and canoodle with aspiring models, although he's certain he's incapable of giving or receiving love.
  Positive
Part of Reay's "job" is to make himself appear successful, but he also seems to be content with or, at least, accustomed to his situation.
  Negative
During a couple of late-night confessionals on that rooftop, though, he admits he has doubts about his career ever going anywhere and about his worth as a person.
  Negative
For a man who lies daily about his lot in life, Reay is surprisingly, starkly honest about himself.
  Positive
There are no major revelations about why Reay lives the way he does no tragic story or significant setback in his past.
  Negative
Wirthensohn flat-out asks him at one point in "Homme Less," and Reay simply says that things didn't quite work out the way he expected.
  Negative
We can relate to that sentiment.
  Negative
We can also, sort of admire Reay's persistence in chasing his dream, even as we wonder if we would have the willpower or patience to live as he does and question his judgment in taking the pursuit to such an extreme.
  Positive
