  Positive
There really is only one option available as to the question of Nizhoni's ancestry.
  Negative
Freeland's screenplay mixes tradition with superstition a dead owl, one character notes, means death is coming, overt foreshadowing of problems to come with omens of impending doom Nizhoni experiences dj vu at the sight of a dead horse adorned with red handprints, and clunky expository dialogue establishing a heap of trouble for these characters.
  Negative
The last point is particularly true for Sick Boy, who is arrested twice, gets into two fights, nearly becomes involved in an armed robbery, and ends up with a man seeking revenge against him.
  Very positive
It's a clutter of half-realized ideas and fully calculated melodrama.
  Negative
The performances here are generally unrefined, with most of the actors including Wilson and Moore barely going beyond rote line readings Bitsui holds his own, although his character also has the heftiest load of conflicts with which to deal.
  Negative
There's a certain quality of unforced, naturalistic charm to the performances at first some of Freeland's most egregiously explanatory dialogue would sound unnatural from even more experienced actors, but they become almost burdensome as the movie thickly lays on the conflicts.
  Neutral
The movie works in its quieter, less busy moments, especially during its domestic scenes.
  Positive
There's a genuine sense of familial and cultural history when Freeland forgoes any of the story's explicit obstacles and simply observes these characters going about their everyday lives.
  Positive
We get a glimpse of sincere conflict in a scene between Sick Boy and his wife, who admits that she's relieved by the idea of her husband joining the Army, if only because it will mean "one less child" for whom she'll have to care.
  Negative
Despite the movie's shortcomings, Freeland shows plenty of promise behind the camera.
  Positive
In those softer scenes, she shows a good deal of patience with and for her characters, and she displays an efficient eye for capturing these locales complemented by Peter Holland's fine cinematography.
  Positive
"Drunktown's Finest" shows a filmmaker struggling to find her voice.
  Negative
It's a whisper here, but we can hear it.
  Neutral
