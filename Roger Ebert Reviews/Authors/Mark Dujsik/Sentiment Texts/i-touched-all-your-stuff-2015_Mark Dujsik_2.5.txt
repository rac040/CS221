"I'm not one of those angry, jealous guys," the man says he told another man over the phone, while trying to gather some information about his girlfriend.
  Negative
Of course, this man the one who claims he's neither the angry nor jealous sort of boyfriend found out that this other man knew his girlfriend after contacting one of the girlfriend's ex-boyfriends.
  Negative
He was able to get the ex-boyfriend's contact information after he rigged his own computer with a program that would record a user's keystrokes.
  Neutral
From there, he was also able to obtain her email password, which he used to find out with whom the girlfriend was communicating online.
  Negative
In other words, Christopher Kirk, despite his protestations, certainly sounds like the jealous type.
  Negative
He covers it up with a smile and an aw-shucks sort of body language while he tells this part of the story, but the way he tells this story is much different than what we hear him say and what we learn he has omitted.
  Positive
Here's the strange thing: "I Touched All Your Stuff" isn't actually about Kirk's experiences with this particular girlfriend.
  Negative
Well, it is to a degree, because that's the story Kirk wants to tell, much to the chagrin of one of the documentary's co-directors.
  Negative
She bemoans that Kirk is the lead actor in the story of his life, yet he seems almost completely absent from his own narrative as he tells it.
  Positive
The story that directors  Mara Bhler and  Matias Mariani want to tell has been hijacked by their central character, who doesn't want to tell that particular tale.
  Negative
One really can't blame them for being misdirected.
  Negative
Kirk weaves a beguiling yarn about misadventures involving the wrong woman, about misplaced love, about the mystery of the behavior of this enigmatic woman, whom he only calls "V." He's charming as he tells it, yet there's something else there.
  Positive
We catch a few moments when his eyes and his mood, which is typically jovial or patient, seem to darken.
  Negative
Perhaps that's just the bias of seeing him in a tiny room inside a Brazilian prison where he's serving time talking.
  Neutral
This man has a secret, and Bhler and Mariani desperately want to get to it.
  Negative
The way they go about trying to find that secret is the movie's most novel conceit.
  Negative
At one point, Kirk directs the filmmakers to find his old computer.
  Negative
Everything they want to know about his time with "V" is on the hard drive.
  Negative
The directors provide interviews with Kirk and an assortment of his friends from Olympia, Wash., where he resided and family from his hometown in Michigan, who all say what a charming but nave and gullible but genuinely nice guy they knew him to be.
  Negative
Bhler and Mariani also present their investigation of that computer.
  Positive
The screen is filled with the contents of the monitor as they peruse files.
  Negative
There are photographs and videos of his travels to Colombia, where Kirk met "V" after traveling there to see drug kingpin Pablo Escobar's hippos, and Los Angeles, where "V" spent a good deal of time with an older Mexican gentleman.
  Negative
The soundtrack is made up of songs they find in the music directory.
  Neutral
There are logs of his online communications with "V" and some of the other men she knew.
  Positive
For some reason, there's a single text file, which has Iago's immortal metaphor describing jealousy as a "green-eyed monster."
  Negative
Surely that's a clue as to what landed Kirk in prison or, at least, the kind of person he really is, despite the persona he presents to the filmmakers.
  Negative
There's a riveting sensation of sleuthing to these sections of the movie, as we attempt to piece together not only the mystery of "V" but also what significance this story has to Kirk's current status as an inmate at a prison in So Paulo.
  Negative
Kirk isn't talking, and that only makes the whole thing more enthralling, particularly when the directors juxtapose his version of tracking down those other men with his angry, jealous correspondences.
  Negative
It makes sense that Kirk would muddy the heart of the matter to inflate his importance, especially when we learn the truth about his incarceration It's a big deal, but it's just not as big as the movie seems to be leading us to believe.
  Negative
The man made national news, but it had nothing to do with his crime just an elaborate prank a friend pulled on him.
  Negative
The problem is that there's really no excuse for the way Bhler and Mariani obscure our perception of this man and the very reason they want to talk to him in the first place, save for the fact that it provides this complicated but ultimately shallow narrative with a hook.
  Negative
Why is Kirk in prison?
  Negative
The answer is a web search away one the filmmakers leave for an anticlimactic, third-act revelation.
  Negative
The reveal tells us little, except that everything we've heard from Kirk is unimportant except, maybe, his interest in those hippos, which might have more to do with their former owner than the beasts themselves.
  Negative
One gets the sense that the filmmakers feel slighted by their subject, and "I Touched All Your Stuff" is an attempt to make us feel that sting of disappointment.
  Positive
In a way, it's effective.
  Positive
The movie is disappointing.
  Negative
