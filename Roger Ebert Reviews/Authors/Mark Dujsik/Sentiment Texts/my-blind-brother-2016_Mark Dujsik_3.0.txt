Bill  Nick Kroll has been overshadowed by his brother Robbie  Adam Scott since a childhood accident resulted in Robbie becoming blind.
  Negative
Robbie took his disability as a motivation to prove that he could rise above it.
  Positive
Bill has been supporting his brother's efforts, which involve displays of physical endurance to raise money for a charitable organization for the blind.
  Neutral
In the process, Robbie has become a local hero, while Bill works at a dead-end job at a printing shop when he isn't helping his brother train for the next event.
  Negative
Lest the setup of "My Blind Brother" begin to sound too inspiring in terms of overcoming physical limitations and sacrificing one's own desires for a loved one, it must be pointed out that neither Bill nor Robbie particularly seem to like each other.
  Negative
Bill hates to exert himself physically.
  Neutral
He also resents that Robbie uses him as something akin to a guide dog and that no one seems to notice his role in Robbie's efforts.
  Negative
As for the brother's feelings toward Bill, Robbie gives a big speech after a marathon-length run.
  Negative
He builds up to thanking the one individual who has been with him through it all the voice in his ear telling him to keep going.
  Positive
That's when he acknowledges the big guy upstairs.
  Neutral
The wording of the build-up seems to take Robbie's omission beyond forgetfulness or ignorance and into the realm of intentional slight.
  Negative
Writerdirector  Sophie Goodhart opens the film her first feature, based on her short on these specific notes of conflict.
  Negative
That turns out to be vital to the success of the film, which quickly becomes a situational comedy about a scenario in which a little bit of honesty from any of the involved characters probably would resolve the plot in an instant.
  Negative
Even the brief time Goodhart spends with these characters before the beginning of the plot's conflict is enough to establish the reason that such a quick, simple resolution is impossible for these people.
  Negative
They are inclined to lie to each other, in order to keep their relationships relatively nice and calm, and to themselves, in order to keep up the other lies.
  Positive
These lies aren't malicious.
  Negative
These are fairly decent people, and they lie because they want to stay decent or at least to keep up the appearance of being good people.
  Positive
The plot involves a romantic triangle of sorts, although it's probable that there are no romantic feelings on the part of Rose  Jenny Slate, the woman who becomes involved with both brothers within a short span of time.
  Negative
She meets Bill at a bar where there's a memorial for her late boyfriend, who was hit by a bus while running after her.
  Positive
He was running because she had just dumped him, and Rose blames herself for the guy's untimely demise.
  Negative
She and Bill have a one-night stand.
  Positive
He wants more, but she turns him down, saying that any relationship she might have now would be doomed.
  Negative
Feeling a need to make up for "killing" her boyfriend, Rose volunteers to help Robbie prepare for a swim across a lake for charity.
  Negative
Robbie misinterprets Rose's helpfulness as something more.
  Positive
When she corrects him, he's embarrassed, and wanting to save him from that embarrassment, Rose kisses him.
  Negative
The two start dating.
  Neutral
Bill, of course, now has another reason to be jealous of his brother.
  Negative
The comedy here goes deeper than the awkward situation or the ways in which Bill and Rose try to hide their recent entanglement from Robbie.
  Negative
Goodhart allows her characters to be a bit pathetic, to possess some despair, and to have qualities that don't exactly endear them to us.
  Negative
Bill is lazy and unmotivated, and whatever drive he has left revolves around his need to one-up his brother.
  Very negative
The joke is that there's no way he can win.
  Negative
Robbie is an inspiration because he is everything that Bill isn't.
  Positive
Bill won't call out his brother for his negative qualities because he doesn't want to be the guy who would shame his blind brother There's also some guilt on Bill's part, hinted at early in the film and made explicit by the end.
  Negative
Bill's only recourse is to offer immature, sarcastic snipes when nobody is paying attention to him which is often.
  Negative
Rose has a co-dependent streak.
  Positive
Her entire sense of self-worth is based on what other people think of her.
  Positive
When the parents of her dead boyfriend run into her and Robbie at a restaurant, she finds herself trying to apologize for how she has started dating again, and then she has to apologize to Robbie for the other apology.
  Negative
In a rather daring turn, Goodhart makes Robbie the most irksome of the bunch.
  Negative
He's spoiled, self-absorbed, and superficial.
  Negative
He worries that Rose doesn't live up to his standards of physical appearance, and at one point, Bill nearly sabotages his brother's romance by lying that Rose has an unsightly birthmark on her cheek.
  Negative
There's an occasional sense that Goodhart has tipped the scales against Robbie on the personality front, if only to justify a few jokes that depend on his disability and, mainly, to excuse Bill for what happens during the climactic swim.
  Negative
Scott's performance leans perhaps a bit too heavily toward Robbie's jerk side, although, as written, there isn't much more to the character.
  Negative
Kroll and Slate, though, give performances that have the opposite effect.
  Negative
They aren't the best people, but the relative goodness of their intentions is never in doubt.
  Neutral
"My Blind Brother" puts these characters through the comic wringer, but the humor is founded on the characters and their flaws, not the circumstances.
  Neutral
