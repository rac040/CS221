"Antarctica: Ice and Sky," a documentary about the scientist whose research first called attention to anthropogenic climate change, ends with the sort of vague call to action that such works typically do.
  Positive
It's a simple question: "What are you going to do?"
  Neutral
The challenge comes across as particularly hollow perhaps even more so than, say, a plea to visit a website or send a text message, although not as pandering as those calls to action, which are meant to make a concerned viewer feel as if they have done something without doing anything of real impact.
  Negative
That is mostly because director  Luc Jacquet has not made a work of direct activism.
  Negative
The last-minute attempt to turn the film into one is never earned.
  Negative
The final question is a momentary misstep in a film that serves perhaps unintentionally as a subtle, almost subversive counterargument to those who would either deny the existence of human-made climate change or dismiss the evidence as some mild deviation from or normal part of the natural climate cycle.
  Negative
The arguments of such people usually rest on the notion that the science is somehow faulty, that the scientists are simply in it for the money, or some other contention that calls into question the processes or integrity of the people who have done or studied the research.
  Negative
Jacquet's film assembles decades of footage from the mid-s to the s of scientists doing that research in the sub-zero temperatures of Antarctica.
  Positive
Seeing the work being done as well as the conditions and dangers that went along with it just about negates such arguments.
  Negative
These scientists whom we see throughout the film are not in it for fame or glory or money.
  Negative
Their research comes at great personal risk to life and limb, and the results are far too alarming for any of these men to have desired them in any way.
  Negative
The central figure of the film is French glaciologist  Claude Lorius, who has participated in  expeditions to the continent over the course of his life.
  Positive
He describes through the voice of  Michel Papineschi the strange, unexpected course of career, as he essentially entered his field of study by accident and became one of its most esteemed forefathers.
  Positive
At the time of filming his segments, Lorius is  years old.
  Negative
He has been honored with multiple awards and has become a respected voice in the call to fight man-made climate change.
  Positive
Lorius, visiting the continent again for the documentary's production, sits and stands around a landscape that has visibly changed from the days of his work.
  Negative
Jacquet's camera makes a stunning sweep across that landscape in one shot, moving from Lorius, as he walks along some snowy terrain, to some barren, gray mountains.
  Positive
We can see the amount of snow lessen and lessen as the shot progresses, until it arrives at a valley where a stream of water trickles along.
  Negative
We know this isn't right, because we see the continent over the course of three decades in the film's extensive archival footage.
  Negative
The majority of the film comprises this footage, as Lorius and his various expedition and research teams spend months on the frozen continent, traveling and sleeping in the cramped compartments of snow vehicles for days or weeks before arriving at slightly more spacious research stations.
  Negative
The temperatures are deadly He relates the story of Russian researchers setting barrels of oil on fire so that the fuel would return to its liquid form.
  Negative
The vehicles must trek across hidden crevasses covered by snow and ice, and the detection equipment keeps failing.
  Negative
The wind blows down the mast above the underground station, forcing him to remove his gloves to manipulate the nuts and bolts of the structure to reassemble it.
  Negative
Lorius' major breakthrough was the development of an ice corer that would eventually retrieve ice thousands of meters below the surface, which, in terms of a geological calendar, translates into hundreds of thousands of years of Earth's history.
  Negative
His most significant discovery made by placing some ancient ice in celebratory glasses of whiskey was that the ice contained air from the era in which it was formed.
  Negative
Lorius, who made his first trip to Antarctica at the age of  primarily for the sense of adventure The film's narration takes on a continuous tone of wonder, becomes a model of professional evolution his work becoming a prime example of how the scientific method is often founded on happenstance.
  Positive
Late in the film, Lorius wonders what his work, all of those awards, and the warnings he and other have made actually mean when those warnings go unheeded.
  Positive
In the film's final montage, he receives his accolades amidst international conference after international conference that has done little to nothing in the grand scheme of things the only way a man such as Lorius, who has spent most of his life studying climatic life of our planet, can see such issues.
  Negative
If anything, the film's primary argument is that we have lost the ability to see that perspective.
  Negative
Regaining that perspective is the start of our only chance.
  Negative
As "Antarctica: Ice and Sky" shows us, it is possible.
  Positive
As a result of Lorius and his team discovering that they could accurately date every nuclear weapon test from radioactive material found in Antarctic ice, there was an international treaty banning such tests, with over  nations signing on to it.
  Negative
Lorius' most important work was conducted as a collaboration between France, the United States, and the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
  Positive
If the people of that time could put their ideological differences aside in recognition of the gravity of such research, surely we can do the same.
  Positive
