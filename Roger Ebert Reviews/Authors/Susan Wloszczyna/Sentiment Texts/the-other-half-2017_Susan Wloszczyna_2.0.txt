Two attractive though damaged souls have an instant connection to one another.
  Negative
He is a brooder with a bit of a chip on his shoulder and is too often itching for a fight.
  Positive
She is a sprightly lass, irrepressibly giddy and always smiling, or so it seems.
  Positive
They initially appear to fill whatever holes exist in each others hearts.
  Neutral
But it is never as easy as that, at least in a somber and derivative relationship drama like The Other Half.
  Negative
If you bled all the humor of out of  Silver Linings Playbook while employing the grunge aesthetics of low-budget arty movies from the s and s, the result would probably look a lot like this feature debut by actor turned writerdirector  Joey Klein that was shot in  days .
  Negative
It is all well and good to allow your camera to slip out of focus to suggest a foggy memory, rely on ambient light sources as a way to reflect the darkening emotional states of your characters and create a sense of fracturing with audio from one shot that seeps into the next.
  Positive
But not when the story itself fails to offer a clear enough picture of events as they unfold.
  Negative
The Other Half at least gets its central casting choices right, which for a while makes it at the very least watchable.
  Positive
The instant that the roughly tall, dark and handsome  Tom Cullen appears as troubled Nickie, a UK transplant who will soon be adrift in Toronto, he looked familiar.
  Negative
Sure enough, he was Lord Gillingham, one of Lady Marys countless suitors on Downton Abbey and, as I recall, I was rooting for him to be the one.
  Very negative
The actors courtship skills, however, take a back seat initially as the film opens with a distraught Nickie focused on his younger brother, who for some unclarified reason went missing five years ago.
  Negative
The next time we see this troubled soul, he is in a dance club moving to throbbing techno music.
  Positive
As he leaves, a man accidentally bumps into him on the sidewalk and he responds by pummeling him.
  Negative
Clearly, Nickie is prone to violently lashing out.
  Negative
Also, he has a cash flow problem, as we spy him talking on a public phone with plastic garbage bags filled with belongings at his feet, assuring his mum back home that he is OK.
  Negative
Basically, Nickie doesnt give a hoot about much, including arriving on time for his waiter job at a bar.
  Positive
In fact, he almost immediately gets into a scuffle with a patron until two young women who have been eyeing him up tell his boss that the other guy started it.
  Negative
Nickie suddenly goes from hothead to sweetheart when he locks eyes with Emily, whose vivacious personality comes courtesy of the immensely engaging  Tatiana Maslany of TV cult hit Orphan Black.
  Positive
Even though she dubs him a serious wacko, they go on a date and romp in the park before he ends up in her bed.
  Negative
While I was never too sure how Nickie eventually supports himself, since Cullen too often mumbles through his British accent he might have said he drove a taxi ... or not, Emily works at a school, although it is never explained if she is a teacher or simply a recess monitor.
  Negative
That leads to outdoor fun and games with water pistols with the kids when Nickie stops by the basketball court.
  Positive
But what goes up must come down especially when Emily eventually explains that the sudden onset of a blue mood swing is due to her suffering from rapid cycling bipolar disorder.
  Negative
She hasnt been taking her meds since Nickie has lifted her spirits.
  Positive
That is fair warning that a meltdown of the highest order is about to occur and, indeed, it does.
  Negative
It involves Ramp'B oldies blaring at wall-rattling volume while Emily manically brushes oil paint on a canvas in a fancy red dress.
  Negative
Her stern-yet-concerned father  Henry Czerny and stepmother do what they can to calm her down.
  Neutral
But when cops arrive to check on the source of loud music complaints, Emily begins to lash out.
  Negative
Meanwhile, Nickie stands outside peering in while helplessly watching her being handcuffed and taken away for treatment.
  Negative
Once Emily comes back, the pair share Nickies small apartment.
  Negative
But after an argument over money at a fancy restaurant where Nickie first meets Emilys parents creates a rift between her and her dad, their life together grows ever more insular and dangerously co-dependent.
  Negative
Maslany puts her talent for portraying multiple personalities that she has shown by inhabiting various clones on Orphan Black to good use as she takes advantage of the showier shades of Emilys mental illness.
  Negative
As a sullen Heathcliff type, Cullen, alas, remains far too long on mute and relies more on his physical presence to convey what Nickie is going through.
  Negative
What The Other Half does best is to make you feel sad.
  Negative
And, in this case, that isnt always good.
  Positive
