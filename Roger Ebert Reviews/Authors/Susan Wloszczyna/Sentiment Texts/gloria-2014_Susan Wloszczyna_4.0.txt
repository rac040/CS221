Gloria,  "Gloria" hallelujah!
  Positive
Your truth has marched its way into my heart.
  Positive
There is that feeling you get inside when a movie suddenly starts to push your every button, creating an emotional connection that goes beyond pure reason and mere emotion.
  Positive
It elevates your mood to such a point that you wish you could hug the screen out of sheer joy and recognition.
  Very positive
That is what "Gloria" did to me.
  Neutral
The Chilean-Spanish production that somehow did not make the cut as a best foreign-language Oscar candidate is a bit of a throwback to the 's, the liberated era that gave us " An Unmarried Woman", " Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore" and " The Goodbye Girl".
  Negative
It was a time when female characters over  or even  were allowed to not only have great sex, but also were given the chance to re-examine the choices they made at this stage especially with men and transform into the person they were always meant to be.
  Negative
"Gloria" covers similar territory, but with a difference.
  Positive
Jill Clayburgh's divorcee in "An Unmarried Woman" could afford one-on-one therapy, had a gaggle of gal pals to turn to for support and toiled in an upscale Soho art gallery.
  Negative
As for Gloria, brought to, yes, glorious life by actress  Paulina Garcia, she's a formerly wed, -ish office worker in Santiago who laughs easily, wails along to the sappy love songs on her car radio and craves new adventures whether bungee-jumping, smoking pot or spur-of-the-moment getaways.
  Negative
The trouble is, most people including her adult son and daughter are either too busy or don't bother to notice that there is a vibrant human being standing before them who aches for intimate contact and a chance to shower someone with affection.
  Negative
In the opening scene, director and co-writer Sebastian Lelio sets a kind of a trap, allowing the moviegoer an opportunity to perhaps jump to unfair assumptions about Garcia's character.
  Positive
There she is, hanging out alone at a gathering for middle-aged singles looking to connect.
  Negative
With her oversized Tootsie-style glasses, crooked smile and prim 's bob, she cuts a rather melancholy figure as she sips her drink and sways alone to the erotic rhythms of Donna Summers' "I Feel Love".
  Negative
Suddenly, Gloria spies a man she vaguely knows and engages in awkward small talk, eventually flirting and dancing a little too enthusiastically with him.
  Negative
But it is all for naught.
  Positive
She goes home alone, where the only warm body that wants to share her bed is a hairless cat who belongs to her crazy upstairs neighbor.
  Negative
As it turns out, however, Gloria is not a victim to be pitied but a fighter.
  Negative
She returns to the club, where this time she spies an slightly older, rumpled gent intently gazing at her.
  Negative
He's Rodolfo Sergio Hernandez, a recently divorced former naval officer, and it turns out he finds her fascinating just as we begin to feel the same way about her, too.
  Negative
They quickly connect romantically, leading to the first of several honestly depicted, completely unglamorous sexual encounters between two people of a certain age that Hollywood rarely attempts, even in such films as " It's Complicated" and " Hope Springs".
  Negative
There is flab, there is sag, there is an elastic girdle-like belt Rodolfo wears as a result of weight-loss surgery.
  Very negative
But there is also heat.
  Neutral
Alas, there is baggage as well.
  Neutral
As Rodolfo's all-too-frequently ringing cell phone reveals, he might be single but his needy daughters and ex-wife still rely on him.
  Neutral
Though his interest in our heroine feels sincere, he is not the type of man who will rush off and leave his family in the lurch.
  Negative
That might a fine quality, but not what Gloria needs or desires at the moment.
  Neutral
She wants fantasy, passion, excitement.
  Positive
And she deserves it.
  Positive
Frustration soon leads to recklessness on Gloria's part, but Lelio who trusts the viewer to fill in many of the blanks for themselves does not judge his characters but allows us to draw our own conclusions.
  Negative
It helps he has someone as wonderfully expressive and real as Garcia, who can go from appearing old and haggard to luminous and adorable seamlessly, at the center of this tale.
  Positive
There is not a false note in her performance, especially in the final scene at a wedding when the song that I kept hearing in my head while watching the film finally filled the soundtrack "Gloria", not the Laura Branigan version from " Flashdance" but the original sung in Italian by Umberto Tozzi.
  Negative
It is up to us to decide whether the sight of Garcia once again alone by choice this time is a moment of triumph or resignation.
  Negative
Me, I was cheering inside.
  Positive
