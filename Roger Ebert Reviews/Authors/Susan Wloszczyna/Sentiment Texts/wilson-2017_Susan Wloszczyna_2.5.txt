Just in case you are wondering, Wilson is not a sequel to  Cast Away.
  Negative
However, those who are white male jerk-averse, especially since there seems to be a surplus of them lately, might prefer the company of  Tom Hanks silent volleyball buddy over the latest iteration of a kooky curmudgeon as unfiltered instigator of awkward confrontations and general annoyance.
  Neutral
But if anyone can make such a character not just amusingly tolerable but even somewhat sympathetic,  Woody Harrelson who rarely gets his proper due for his vital contributions to movies ranging from the "Hunger Games franchise to last years  The Edge of Seventeen would be a good choice.
  Negative
He fully exploits his sarcastic delivery, scalawag smirk and an effective pair of cartoonish horn-rimmed specs to make his bitter and lonely middle-aged loser a droll companion.
  Negative
That is, if he doesnt sidle up to the seat next to you on a near-empty bus and gripe your ear off about all and nothing.
  Negative
This is not a new invention by any means.
  Negative
Lionel Barrymores misanthropic Mr. Potter followed the dramatic blueprint laid down by cranky penny-pincher Ebenezer Scrooge, while  Walter Matthau injected a sardonic humorous element to the archetype in  The Odd Couple,  The Bad News Bears and  Grumpy Old Men.
  Negative
Meanwhile,  Billy Bob Thornton took middle-age misbehavior to the next foul-mouthed degenerate level in  Bad Santa.
  Negative
Lately, taking on such cranky roles has almost become a rite of passage for actors, mainly male but also female, of a certain AARP-eligible demo.
  Positive
Where would  Robert De Niro and  Shirley MacLaines late-life resumes be without such temperamental old-timers?
  Negative
Bruce Dern and  June Squibb groused their way to Oscar nominations in  Nebraska and  Bill Murray has simply spun his younger wise-guy persona into similar sterling senior moments on screen.
  Positive
Jack Nicholson and  Morgan Freeman went for it and scored a hit with  The Bucket List.
  Positive
Kathy Bates  About Schmidt and  Lily Tomlin  Grandma have struck gold in irascible lady roles.
  Negative
Heck,  Larry David has been playing a heightened version of his uncensored, off-putting self in Curb Your Enthusiasm on HBO since  and it is about to return for a ninth season.
  Negative
One reason why these characters are perennials?
  Negative
They actually ring true.
  Positive
As anyone who has been in the presence of those enjoying their golden years, people often act as if their advanced status gives them license to say whatever they want, non-PC consequences be damned.
  Negative
I myself have been known to make a somewhat inappropriate comment or two.
  Neutral
Basically, it's now or never.
  Neutral
As adapted by  Daniel Clowes  Ghost World from his graphic novel and directed by  Craig Johnson  The Skeleton Twins, this hard slap at the perceived stupidity of the world by a disenfranchised citizen pitches its black humor in appallingly funny if occasionally poignant episodes as we get to know the title characters Minnesota-based urban milieu.
  Negative
That is, before the plot opts for cop-out sentimentality and begins to melt into goo.
  Negative
Much like  Thora Birchs Enid in Ghost World, Wilsons street-corner apartment atop an out-of-business karate studio is awash in flea-market finds and old paperbacks stuffed in every corner with a large poster of Moby Dick as the centerpiece.
  Negative
There is no hint that Wilson ever had a vocation of any sort.
  Negative
A plus: He loves his dog, a wire fox terrier named Pepper.
  Positive
A minus: His wife left him  years ago after she ran off to Los Angeles, aborted their baby and became a drug addict and possibly a prostitute.
  Negative
His life, such as it is, turns upside-down when his only friends decide to move and he gets a call that his father is near death in a hospital.
  Positive
His planned bedside reconciliation with his dad sadly arrives too late.
  Negative
Wilson is so desperate for companionship, he seeks out a shady childhood buddy named Olsen  David Warshofsky, who is basically a disturbed hermit who wishes his -something father would meet his demise already.
  Negative
After a few minutes of trying make a connection, a grieving Wilson thanks him for the reminder that hes a toxic soul-draining vampire.
  Negative
After a meet-strange with a woman who cant stop talking about her boyfriend of six years who left her because he was a homo  Margo Martindale, supporting player supreme, she helps Wilson track down his ex, Pippi  Laura Dern, always a pro at neurotic women on the verge, via Google.
  Negative
Turns out she has cleaned up her act and is semi-glad to reunite.
  Negative
But after they cozy up in bed, she reveals that she actually put their baby up for adoption.
  Negative
Of course, Wilson hunts the girl down without warning and she's revealed to be a portly goth high-schooler  Isabella Amara, who knows how to squeeze the most out of a sour look with attitudinal issues.
  Negative
In other words, a surly chip off the old block.
  Negative
From there, Wilson attempts to act as if he is now a family man despite the fact that his daughters adoptive parents know nothing about his existence.
  Negative
This results in a misbegotten odyssey to visit Pippis smugly self-satisfied suburbanite sister, Polly  Cheryl Hines, and her ultra-normal clan, with violently disastrous results.
  Negative
Wilson should have known better.
  Negative
When he tells Pippi that her disparaging sister is a living death, she complains that he says that about everyone.
  Negative
He answers, Was I wrong?
  Negative
Even Wilson is sometimes right.
  Neutral
I do appreciate that Harrelson is surrounded by a bevy of top-notch actresses, all of whom bring out different shades in Wilsons crotchety demeanor.
  Positive
Although if  Judy Greer is reduced to being an accommodating girlfriend ever again, there should be a law declared to ban such wastefulness.
  Negative
But while Wilson peters out at the end, one cant totally dismiss a movie that gets away with a visual  Umberto D joke and showcases probably the worst tramp-stamp tattoo ever.
  Negative
