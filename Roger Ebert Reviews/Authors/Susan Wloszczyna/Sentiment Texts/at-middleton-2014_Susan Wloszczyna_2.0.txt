It is somewhat refreshing that "At Middleton", a middling romantic comedy set during a tour of a scenic college campus, focuses on a couple of adults at a crossroads in their lives rather than a pair of entitled adolescents pondering which prospective institute of higher education to attend.
  Positive
What proves less than satisfying is how much energy directorco-writer Adam Rodgers expends to simply prove the mossy adage that opposites do indeed attract.
  Negative
Like their characters, first-time co-stars  Andy Garcia and  Vera Farmiga at least have one commonality.
  Negative
Both broke out in gangster dramas: For him, 's "The Godfather Part III", and for her, 's " The Departed".
  Neutral
As the gap between those years suggests, the male of this potential love-match equation is a tad old for the female half Garcia is , Farmiga is .
  Negative
In this area, "At Middleton" faithfully upholds one of Hollywood's favorite double standards.
  Positive
As for Garcia's George, a heart surgeon, and Farmiga's Edith, a retailer of children's furniture, both parents are accompanying their only offspring on a road-trip quest to decide their academic futures.
  Negative
And that is where the similarities end.
  Negative
Bow-tie enthusiast George is an uptight square who shuns taking risks.
  Negative
Unconventional Edith is a mouthy free spirit for whom rules are meant to be broken.
  Negative
Of course, his happy-go-lucky son, Conrad Spencer LoFranco, is maddeningly cavalier about their mission while her daughter, Audrey Farmiga's look-alike teen sister Taissa, is a humorless perfectionist who leaves little to chance.
  Negative
After revealing that  Audrey Hepburn inspired her child's name, Edith admits, "I should have named her Benito."
  Negative
After Edith starts to annoy other visitors by peppering the overtly sincere student tour guide who declares that his dual major of horticulture and music qualifies him as a "dingleberry" and, no, that label isn't funny no matter how many times it is repeated with questions about the rate of murders and rape at Middleton, the two parents decide to explore the environs on their own.
  Negative
You know things are about to go middle-age crazy when Edith suggests to George that they "borrow" two abandoned bicycles they happen upon along the way.
  Negative
"This is fate," she says giddily.
  Negative
"This is theft," he says nervously.
  Positive
And off they go.
  Neutral
Somewhere between creating a disturbance at the library, climbing to the top of a bell tower where George panics over his fear of heights, performing a flirtatious duet of Chopsticks on a piano, disrupting a drama class before giving an impromptu master class in improv and getting stoned with a pre-med student and his girlfriend, these madcap gadabouts reveal to one another that they both are married.
  Negative
And not necessarily happily, especially now that their kids won't be around much longer to provide an emotional buffer against any marital strife.
  Negative
It is hard to root for their possible infidelity, considering we barely know any details about George and Edith's personal situations, other than they are all too willing to abandon their children with barely a second thought and frolic about on their own.
  Negative
Matters would grow more tiresome if not for two welcome if all too brief appearances by a couple of cool cats who act as surrogate parents.
  Negative
Former "Animal House" rowdy  Peter Riegert does his best  Wolfman Jack imitation as a DJ named Boneyard Sims who initiates Conrad into the ways of collegiate radio hosting.
  Negative
A handsomely wizened  Tom Skerritt gets to put presumptuous Audrey in her place as the esteemed professor of linguistics that she has idolized since the ninth grade.
  Negative
"At Middleton" is the just the sort of trite if inoffensive diversion that barely tiptoes into theaters before landing in the cable and video-on-demand listings.
  Negative
And Garcia and Farmiga, as good as they can be in the right roles, aren't doing themselves or their careers any favors with this sort of C-level effort.
  Positive
At least the ending is brazen enough not to conclude in a tidy fashion.
  Negative
But watching George and Edith cavort in slo-mo while being drenched in a campus fountain is antithesis of enjoying " Annie Hall" and Alvy Singer as those classic polar opposites engage in battle against a runaway lobster.
  Negative
One scene has comic snap.
  Positive
The other is merely soggy.
  Negative
