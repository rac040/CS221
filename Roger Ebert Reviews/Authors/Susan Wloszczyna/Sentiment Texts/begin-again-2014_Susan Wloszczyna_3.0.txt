For  John Carney, " Once" apparently is not enough.
  Negative
The Irish writerdirector who serenaded the world with that wee Dublin fairy-tale sensation from  is back again to tease audiences with another song-filled variation on his signature brand of platonic lust in "Begin Again."
  Neutral
With its cast of extremely likable performers, the perfect summer-in-the-city backdrop in this case, New York and a soundtrack stuffed with catchy, well-produced hits, "Begin Again" makes for easy-breezy entertainment.
  Positive
And it provides the perfect alternative to certain obnoxious boy toys that will be mangling the box office into their own private playpen this weekend.
  Positive
The one fly in this perfectly fine ointment: Carneys idea ofromance leaves me frustrated.
  Positive
Not that the guy isnt fully capable of being a matchmaker.
  Neutral
The stars of "Once,"  Glen Hansard and  Marketa Irglova, turned into a real-life couple for a while after working together.
  Negative
But onscreen, the filmmaker likes to keep sexual combustibility on a simmer while never fully turning up the heat as if even a mere kiss would scorch the sacred essence shared by spiritual soul mates.
  Positive
Some might prefer that approach as opposed to more clichd male-female entanglements.
  Negative
But think what would have happened if Carney had made "When Harry Met Sally".
  Neutral
That classic funny valentine would probably end with the two leads exchanging a handshake, a knowing look or even just a heartfelt thank-you while agreeing that, yes, they should just be friends.
  Positive
Sadder yet, we would never get to hear Harrys memorable New Years Eve admission to Sally: I came here tonight because when you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible.
  Negative
Dont you just want to sigh after reading that?
  Negative
Probably the only time I sighed during "Begin Again," which used to carry the more provocative title "Can a Song Save Your Life?"
  Negative
when it premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival last fall, was the sight of  Mark Ruffalos scruffy record-label exec, Dan, as he doffs his undies before jumping into the shower.
  Negative
No one can blame  Catherine Keener, in yet another of her string of estranged bitter wife roles OK, she is good at them, for sneaking a sly peek after turning down his offer to join him in his sudsing.
  Positive
Basically, a movie cant help but be bettered by the presence of this gloriously hirsute actor with the killer smile, unruly curls and bedroom eyes.
  Positive
Thats true even if Ruffalo is a cash-strapped boozehound of a loser who is desperate to find a musical discovery that will restore his status in the industry, give him a reason to pull his life back together and allow him to pick up a bar tab once in a while.
  Negative
But as he proved early in his career as the feckless brother in " You Can Count on Me," Ruffalo is nothing if not eminently redeemable.
  Negative
His savior ends up being  Keira Knightley as Gretta, a British singer-songwriter introduced at an open-mike night at an East Village saloon after her smug, self-involved and pretentious rock star ascendant American boyfriend  Adam Levine of Maroon  and TVs "The Voice," basically playing off his public persona to the hilt cheats on her while leaving her to fend for herself in the big city.
  Negative
Its an event that, since she is an intuitive Artiste with a capital A and an e at the end, spontaneously inspires the ditty she performs hours later.
  Positive
"Begin Again" is aptly named since it, indeed, recounts the same day over again in its opening sequences before Gretta and Dan meet after her performance.
  Positive
First, it is told from Dans point of view as his haphazard behavior negatively affects all he encounters, especially his neglected teen daughter  Hailee Steinfeld.
  Negative
Then we witness Grettas version, as she learns her squeeze for the past five years has cheated on her.
  Negative
How?
  Neutral
By listening to the lyrics of his new song.
  Neutral
See, she is quite the intuitive Artiste.
  Negative
From there, a drunken Dan and an intrigued Gretta decide to make a demo album all on their own, along with some seed money courtesy of a rap impresario a large and in charge Ceelo Green, basically playing off his public persona to the hilt who owes a debt to Dan for his career.
  Negative
And because they want to keep it real, as Artistes are wont to do, they will be recording everything outdoors in alleys, on rooftops, in the subway allowing the city to add its own music.
  Negative
Its all very green, natural, sincere and reeking of integrity.
  Positive
Of course, making an audio baby together brings the pair closer but never THAT close, although they both influence the choices each makes afterwards.
  Negative
What follows isnt always predictable and that is admirable.
  Positive
However, as good as Knightley is in the role, Gretta continues to be more of an idealized muse and less a fully-rounded person.
  Neutral
How darn retro-cute and somewhat nauseating is it that she has  Frank Sinatras "Luck Be a Lady Tonight,"  Stevie Wonders "For Once in My Life" and Dooley Wilsons "As Time Goes By" on her digital playlist?
  Negative
A higher budget and actual stars allow Carney to add a not-displeasing gloss to "Begin Again" and he has terrific taste in actors, including  James Corden as Grettas busking buddy who is about to break out in "One Chance" and "Into the Woods" later this year.
  Positive
And, yes, Knightley can warble well enough in a feathery emo-rock way about assorted heartaches imagine Alanis Morrisette after downing too many breath mints and a Valium.
  Negative
Ultimately, any movie that is driven by music should leave you humming as you leave the theater.
  Negative
Whether its the tunes or Ruffalo that causes you to feel that way, it is all good enough.
  Positive
