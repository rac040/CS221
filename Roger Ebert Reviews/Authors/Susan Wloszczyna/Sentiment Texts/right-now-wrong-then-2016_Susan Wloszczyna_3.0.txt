Somehow, until now, I have never experienced a film by South Koreas  Hong Sang-soo, who made his debut as a director back in .
  Negative
From what I gather, though, his low-budget efforts tend to contain similar elements: A self-impressed film director, a movie critic, an attractive girl, awkward social interactions and drinking binges.
  Negative
Sounds as if his oeuvre should be dubbed mumble-Korean.
  Neutral
Judging from Right Now, Wrong Then, Hongs approach also is heavy on conversations conducted during long languid takes while bereft of any pulse-pounding cataclysmic events.
  Negative
A visit to an outdoor ice rink that provides miniature sleds instead of skates to glide upon is as close to an action sequence as the movie gets.
  Negative
But with his  th feature, he has discovered a rather clever way to repeat himself anew.
  Positive
He splits Right Now, Wrong Then down the middle, presenting the same characters, locales and circumstances twice during an identical -hour period yet with adjustments both obvious and subtle.
  Negative
Imagine  Groundhog Day, if  Bill Murray only had two shots to get it right.
  Neutral
Or  Woody Allens  Melinda and Melinda, but without any toggling between comedy and tragedy.
  Neutral
Or  Before Sunrise with two sunrises.
  Neutral
The basics are the same: Because of a scheduling flub, noted Seoul-based art-house director Han Chun-su played by Jung Jae-young, a lanky sort who sports a sweeping curtain of dark bangs arrives a day early to a wintertime film festival in Suwon, where he is scheduled to screen one of his works and participate in a lecture.
  Negative
We quickly surmise that he has an eye for his attractive female fan base, including a festival worker, who gushes you are the most important director to me as he basks in her flattery.
  Positive
While touring an ornate, ancient palace, he happens upon Hee-jung Kim Min-hee, an introverted painter and former model who recognizes his name but has never seen his films.
  Negative
They end up spending the day together, drinking tea and coffee, visiting her art studio, going out for sushi and indulging in numerous shots of rice alcohol before stumbling together to her poet friends small party at a cafe.
  Positive
Some shifts are cinematic, such as the outdoor lighting, camera angles, perspectives and outcomes that lead to a variance in tone.
  Negative
As a result, the first hour which playfully opens with the heading Right Then, Wrong Now feels colder, draggier, more aloof and downbeat.
  Negative
The second is warmer, funnier and candid and, because of those qualities, ends on a sweeter,  Lost in Translation-type melancholy note.
  Neutral
But our perception of what happens is most dramatically changed by the intriguing ways that the two leads skillfully transform their performances.
  Positive
In Part , Han is clearly on the make as he disingenuously engages in mundane chitchat with Hee-jung.
  Negative
At her studio, he puts a positive spin on her efforts at abstract painting by noting that she basically goes with the flow without a plan and how that is a hard path which, we learn later, is the way he regularly describes his own relationship to his films.
  Positive
After imbibing too much soju, Han comes on strong as he repeatedly tells Hee-jung that she is pretty and, as will be eventually revealed, is hiding an important fact from her.
  Negative
As for Hee-jung, she portrays herself as a loner, one who is insecure, adrift and somewhat sheltered especially when we find out she lives with her mother, who is impatiently waiting up for her when she gets home.
  Negative
But in Part , Han and Hee-jung are much more on equal footing.
  Negative
It is clear that he is interested in her not just as a potential conquest but as a person as he masterfully draws her out of her shell.
  Negative
The same filmmaker who comes off like a pretentious creep during the first portion, even angrily berating his interviewer at an ill-attended Qamp'A, is now honest, open and caring about others which allows Jung multiple occasions to deploy his sigh-inducing smile.
  Neutral
Unfortunately, he becomes a bit too candid when he criticizes Hee-jung for not taking enough risks with her art.
  Very negative
He apologizes for his remarks when asked if all directors are like that, he answers with a knowing grin, Yes, we are but they seem to have a positive effect as well.
  Positive
Hee-jung, on the other hand, feels less directionless and more in control.
  Negative
Perhaps it is the fact that she is attempting to stop smoking and drinking to excess shows that she is striving to improve her life.
  Negative
And, instead of putting up her guard, she ever so gently opens her heart even if it is clear that this couple is not meant to be.
  Negative
So what are we to make of all this opportunity to compare and contrast?
  Neutral
Does it mean something that the orange paint that Hee-jung uses in the first half later is substituted with green?
  Neutral
Or that Han elects to use the hood on his jacket to ward off the cold in the second portion when he first encounters her?
  Neutral
And how do the small choices we make on a daily basis affect how we relate to others and the outside world?
  Neutral
Despite the fact that not much of actual consequence happens during Right Now, Wrong Then, Hong does much more right here than he does wrong.
  Negative
On its own, each hour doesnt have much impact narratively.
  Negative
If all I saw was the first half, I would have given it a shrug and left in a semi-foul mood.
  Negative
But the whole is greater for being two parts in this case, making me glad that I have finally lost my Hong Sang-soo virginity.
  Negative
