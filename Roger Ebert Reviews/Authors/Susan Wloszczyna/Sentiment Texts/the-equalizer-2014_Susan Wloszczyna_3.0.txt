Its  sometimes easy to forget that  Denzel Washingtons resume is as full of  action thrillers as it is stocked with weighty dramas that cry out for  awards.
  Positive
But The  Equalizer is a high-impact  reminder.
  Positive
Yes, it is part  Man on Fire, part  Taxi Driver and outright  based on the s TV series of the same name that starred Edward  Woodward as a former covert operative turned guardian angel for helpless  victims.
  Negative
If "The  Equalizer"  lacks gravitas, it is fairly sturdy as far as pure entertainment goes and the actor takes his stealth vigilante as seriously as he does his  Oscar-nominated performances in " Flight" or " Malcolm X," pulling out that  patented charm as well as considerable deadly force.
  Positive
Unlike many of  those AARP card-carriers in "The Expendables," Denzel, at the ripe age of  , is still dependable as a man who gets the job done when the meanies  run amok, and who still draws a crowd at theaters when he does so.
  Negative
"The  Equalizer"  is especially noteworthy since it pairs Washington again with Antoine  Fuqua, the director behind his Oscar-winning role in s Training  Day.
  Positive
But dont expect any King Kong ain't got shit on me histrionics  in this caper.
  Negative
Washingtons Robert McCall exudes a serene calm while  living a low-profile Spartan-like solo existence as a clerk at a Boston  area Home Depot-like emporium.
  Positive
While  his co-workers treat him with respect and count on him for advice, they  also wonder about his past.
  Positive
He jokes with a couple young guys that he  used to be a Pip meaning one of Gladys Knights backup singerdancers and they almost buy it as Washington pulls off some smooth old-school  moves.
  Negative
His McCall was a pip all right.
  Neutral
The kind of pip who can pre-visualize a  potentially explosive situation with brilliant Sherlock-level precision,  and dispatch would-be assailants with swift and often grisly violence.
  Positive
He also employs a watch timer to judge how long it will take to wipe out  a threat.
  Positive
Usually, it is within seconds.
  Negative
We  sense he hasnt had to use these special skills for a while.
  Negative
Instead,  this apparent insomniac spends his nights sipping tea while reading  classics including The Old Man and the Sea, Don  Quixote and The Invisible Man, titles that all comment on his current status in  an all-night diner that Edward Hopper would appreciate.
  Negative
But he soon will  be called upon to pull his fighting skills out of hibernation after  meeting a sweet-but-wounded teen call girl who hangs out at the  restaurant between clients.
  Negative
What  could be an uncomfortable relationship between retired killer and an  underage prostitute who goes by the name Teri is sensitively handled.
  Negative
And it helps that  Chloe Grace Moretz keeps her moppets precocious  sexuality in check, and instead makes a sincere connection with this  lonely widower, even revealing her dreams to be a singer.
  Positive
But when she  doesnt show up for her usual late-night dessert after a brutal beating  by her Russian pimp has landed her in the hospital, McCall is ready to  return to duty.
  Negative
From  there, it is a game of cat and mouse as Washington hunts down the  perpetrator and his thugs at a Russian restaurant.
  Negative
Part of the fun, if  you want to call it that, is how the baddies always underestimate him.
  Positive
And pay quite the price in doing so.
  Negative
Lets just say you might regard  corkscrews in a whole new way after this ugly confrontation.
  Negative
Of  course, there is a Mr. Big above the pimp, a gangster ironically named  Teddy whose torso is like a Sistine Chapel for Satanic images.
  Neutral
Marton  Csokas sneers with sardonic relish and gives us someone truly hissable  to root against, especially as it becomes apparent how deeply these  Eastern European no-goodniks are engrained in corrupt activity in the  U.S. Meanwhile, Teddys boss is eager to locate the mystery avenger who  is knocking off his workers and undermining his lucrative businesses.
  Very negative
Fuqua  likes to turn the act of violence into a sort of crude ballet, complete  with repeated images of flowing water, as if washing evil away.
  Negative
All  that is fine, although it keeps The  Equalizer  from being as lean and mean as it could be.
  Positive
While some might decry the  ludicrous showdown that unfolds in the darkened aisles of McCalls  mega-store workplace, I got a kick out of watching Washington turn  everyday hardware supplies into lethal weaponry.
  Negative
Then again, I have been  a fan of mayhem occurring in a place of commerce ever since "Dawn of the  Dead"s climactic zombies-vs.
  Negative
-humans battle that takes place inside of a  mall.
  Neutral
Basically, The  Equalizer  is an average-Joe blue-collar version of a comic-book avenger, secretly  stalking those responsible for abusing and preying upon innocent  citizens.
  Negative
And this film acts as an origin story with an ending that  suggests a new franchise is afoot.
  Negative
It might not be bad for Washington to  stay in the action game in a series that at least acknowledges those  who qualify for a senior discount can be crusaders, too.
  Negative
