Who, exactly, has been looking forward to  Bridget Joness Baby?
  Negative
Hard to say, considering the odds of it being a worthy continuation seem stacked against it.
  Positive
Take Father Time, for one.
  Neutral
It has been  years since the original bestseller was released that spawned not just a raft of chick-lit imitators but also two films, the  romantic comedy hit Bridget Joness Diary and its inferior  sequel,  Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason.
  Neutral
The passage of time is also reflected in the characters.
  Positive
The central -something working gal, still a singleton, is now at the brink of middle age.
  Positive
Not that there is anything wrong with that.
  Negative
But when a certain male critic viewed the trailer, he took offense that the adorably effervescent star of the franchise,  Rene Zellweger, had the temerity to look like someone who is in her s.
  Positive
But it does suggest the target audience, the Bridget brigade as it were, might be shifting to a more mature, less hip demo.
  Negative
Then there is the physical absence of  Hugh Grant, who declined to return as Daniel Cleaver, Bridgets former boss and caddish ex-paramour.
  Neutral
As for this avid fan of both the first book and film, I cant have been alone in wavering back and forth between cautious optimism and abject fear that the latest big-screen chapter with its soap-opera-ish who-done-it?
  Negative
paternity plot involving two possible baby daddies returnee  Colin Firth and Yank newcomer Patrick McDreamy Dempsey would fail to reprise the relatable yet distinctly screwball essence that so delightfully informed Bridget Joness Diary.
  Negative
Therefore, I take pleasure in announcing that this update on Bridgets always-complicated affairs of the heart is more often than not a bundle of joy to watch and a far cry from being a pail of poopy nappies.
  Negative
It appears that Emma Thompson, who remains the only person to ever win Oscars for both acting s  Howards End and screenwriting s Sense and Sensibility, assumed the guise of a fairy godmother while doing a total rewrite of an already-existing script.
  Negative
Some very witty pixie dust has been sprinkled over this enterprise, even if the climatic birth sequence hits the usual big-moment notes water breaking, a mad dash to the hospital, labor-pain agony, etc.
  Negative
Thompson also proves a perfect foil to Zellweger onscreen as a no-nonsense obstetrician who takes wicked delight in describing her patients pregnancy as geriatric on a regular basis.
  Positive
She also gets points for having her doctor shoo the potential fathers out of the room when matters get down to the nitty gritty, noting that her own husband always left at those times because, as he said, It was like watching his favorite pub burn down.
  Negative
As for how she handles Grants no-show, it is quite ingenious.
  Positive
Back from a six-year acting hiatus, Zellweger herself is still perfectly attuned lilting Brit accent, messy pratfalls, lusty dalliances and all to the role that led to her first lead Academy Award nomination, a rarity for a comic performance.
  Positive
Besides being older, she is also slimmer, something that Bridget happily declares at least initially before pregnancy enters the picture.
  Negative
She even does a sort of SoulCycle class and proudly notes at one point that she stopped smoking , days ago.
  Negative
But Miss Jones hasnt changed completely, as the opening scene cutely parrots the one from  Bridget Jones's Diary.
  Negative
She celebrates her rd birthday alone in her cozy London abode.
  Positive
She dons PJs, guzzles wine, blows out a single candle on a cupcake and lip-syncs to the same pity-party ode, All By Myself until she switches musical gears and giddily hops about to House of Pains rap ditty Jump Around.
  Negative
There is a welcome sense of familiarity in Bridget Jones's Baby but also of the fresh and au courant.
  Positive
It helps that Bridget Jones's Diary director  Sharon Maguire is back along with several key cast members, including priceless comic input from  Jim Broadbent and  Gemma Jones as Bridgets dad and mom who, inconveniently, is a local political candidate running on a family values platform.
  Positive
But no returnee is more essential than the only man in the world worthy of playing barrister Mark Darcy.
  Negative
Who else besides Firth could make being a mirthless uptight conservative so sexy?
  Negative
Every time you might wonder, What does Bridget see in him, he goes and says the absolute right thing in the most sincere way.
  Positive
Alas, how the two, who never did get married despite what Bridget Jones: Edge of Reason suggested, initially reconnect before hopping into bed is best kept a wait-and-see secret.
  Negative
As for what is new, Bridget is still prone to blunders but as a respected TV news producer, she no longer seems quite so insecure.
  Negative
Not even when she gets a younger boss complete with blood-red lipstick and a severe hairdo who is tasked with rebranding ie.
  Negative
dumbing down the show.
  Neutral
These segments play like a slapstick version of  Broadcast News for a social-media-obsessed era, bright, funny and on the nose.
  Positive
Bridgets friends still fret over her husband-less status and the ever-nearing expiration date on her ovaries even if she is in constant demand as a godmother.
  Negative
And her love life is currently non-existent to the point that her box of emergency eco-friendly condoms are barely useable.
  Negative
But then a millennial co-worker tricks her into going to a boho outdoor music festival, complete with glamping yurts and a cameo by Ed Sheeran.
  Negative
That is when she drunkenly stumbles into Dempseys luxury outdoor digs after previously being rescued by him, Prince Charming-style, and decides to stay the night.
  Negative
Yes, a pregnancy test soon follows and the script goes to great lengths to keep us in the dark about the identity of the babys father along with Bridget, Mark and Dempseys Jack Qwant, who just happens to be a bachelor billionaire founder of a popular match-making website.
  Negative
That I was invested in the not-hard-to-guess outcome is primarily because I did indeed want to be in the company of this tangled trio.
  Negative
There is a certain sloppiness to the continuity and editing at times, such as when an undressed baby is suddenly shown clothed seconds later.
  Negative
But I was mostly enjoying the fact of how this is a rare female adult character in a mainstream movie who continues to be allowed to enjoy casual sex in addition to having a baby out of wedlock without suffering from guilt pangs.
  Positive
Bridget Jones was and is the original  Sex and the City girl.
  Positive
And it is good to see her again.
  Positive
