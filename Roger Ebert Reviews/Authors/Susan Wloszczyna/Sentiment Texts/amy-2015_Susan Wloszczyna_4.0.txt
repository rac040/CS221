Its a shock to see this raven-haired go-getter so full of life, so full of possibilities and so full of herself at such an early age.
  Positive
There she is in grainy home-video footage with her female chums with a smattering of adolescent acne on her fresh face, innocently sucking on a lollipop and throatily belting out the sing-song refrain of Happy Birthday as if she were possessed by the spirit of an ancient Ramp'B diva.
  Negative
This is the  Amy Winehouse few of us ever got to witness, radiating cheeky self-confidence and finding joy in sharing her considerable gifts.
  Positive
The one who existed before the brutally invasive flash-flash-flash of the paparazzis omnipresent cameras eventually snuffed out the very flame that once burned so bright inside of her.
  Positive
What most of us do know of Winehouse, a throwback to the great jazz songstresses of yore who was also informed by hip-hop, reggae, girl-group pop and soul, is that this North London-born chanteuse burst onto the scene like a supernova and burned up the charts with her  breakthrough album Back to Black, selling over  million copies and winning five Grammys.
  Positive
For a time, her catchy signature tune, the all-too-appropriate Rehab, was inescapable and helped shape her coquettish bad-girl persona.
  Negative
And, almost as quickly, she succumbed to the ultimate showbiz clich, dying from accidental alcohol poisoning in .
  Negative
Thus, Winehouse became a charter member of the  Club, which refers to the age of such music legends as Brian Jones, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison when they reached their own much-too-early expiration dates.
  Negative
Winehouse seemingly had the vocal goods to have gone down in history as one of the all-time greats based on what is on display in Amy, a highly absorbing, sensitively told and ultimately devastating documentary directed by  Asif Kapadia  Senna.
  Negative
Whether she was busily scribbling her sexually-charged confessional lyrics in her girlish curlicue handwriting or wailing away at maximum strength minus a backing track in a recording studio with note-perfect pizzazz, Winehouse is revealed to be a natural-born entertainer with a raw sound and street style that borrowed from the past  a sultry Sarah Vaughan at the intersection of bee-hived Ronnie Spector and fragile Edith Piaf  while being her own person and true to herself as an artist.
  Negative
But, as the film also makes all too clear, Winehouse was cursed with an array of dysfunctional traits that would inevitably combust into an inferno of public self-destruction.
  Negative
Many of the danger signs were there even before the incendiary element of celebrityhood arrived on the scene: An addictive personality, an often-maddening passive-aggressive nature, an unhealthy appetite for drugs and alcohol, a passion for reckless partying, a weakness for manipulative men, daddy issues that dated from her parents break-up when she was a child, lifelong struggles with depression, bulimia and self-doubt.
  Negative
Yes, the heady steady climb to success followed by a dizzying downward spiral is a staple of cautionary showbiz sagas.
  Negative
And the growing abundance of music-related documentaries following the Oscar wins for  Feet From Stardom and  Searching for Sugar Man is not abating.
  Negative
This year has already brought a well-received documentary,  Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck, about the Nirvana front man, a fellow member of the  Club and whose own struggles in the limelight closely parallel Winehouses.
  Very positive
But what sets Amy apart from similar train-wreck bio-docs arent necessarily any new revelations.
  Neutral
After all, her song lyrics  which Kapadia smartly employs as captions onscreen to draw out their power  pretty much unveil the heart of the tale all on their own.
  Positive
Instead, what stands out is the almost overwhelming sense of voyeuristic intimacy achieved by a vast array of archival clips, many unseen before and some shot by Winehouse herself, accompanied by vividly candid current-day audio commentary by those who knew her best.
  Negative
Sometimes, it feels as if we are eavesdropping on day-to-day conversations rather than just hearing the usual litany of platitudes and regrets.
  Negative
With more than  subjects interviewed by Kapadia and his team, ranging from invaluable childhood chums like  Juliette Ashby and first manager Nick Shymansky a sweet guy who I am guessing harbored a unrequited crush for Winehouse to professional collaborators such as rapper  Yasiin Bey aka  Mos Def and producer  Salaam Remi, Amy could not feel more personal unless the director had included X-rays of Winehouse in the mix.
  Negative
Every rise-and-fall story has its share of villains.
  Neutral
That role in Amy is primarily played by her father, Mitch, who would introduce her to the retro tunes crooned by  Frank Sinatra and other jazz greats that influenced her.
  Negative
But, more often, the onetime cab driver comes off as a leech who basked in his daughters glory an incident while she rested post-rehab on Saint Lucia in  and he brought along his own camera crew when he visited her especially stands out with only minimal concern for her well-being.
  Negative
Its no surprise that he has disassociated himself from this project.
  Negative
Meanwhile, mom Janis is on camera saying how, when her teen daughter revealed that her dieting regimen consisted of binging and purging, she just shrugged it off with little concern.
  Negative
Public enemy No.
  Neutral
, however, is the rather slimy jailbird reprobate who was her husband for several years, Blake Fielder-Civil.
  Negative
He got her hooked on heroin and crack cocaine, and kept her that way in order to ensure that his meal ticket was dependent on him.
  Positive
The footage of the ravaged pair after an altercation  she with her trademark eyeliner smeared all over now-gaunt face, he with blood dripping down his face  seems to suggest they were the hipster answer to Sid and Nancy.
  Negative
On the upside, their on-and-off toxic romance formed the backbone for most of the songs found on Back to Black.
  Positive
However, it is duly observed that Winehouse also played a major part in sealing her tragic fate, especially after appointing her concert promoter Raye Cosbert as her manager while on the verge of global stardom.
  Neutral
The point is made by one interview subject that a promoter is primarily interested in keeping a client constantly on the road, since tours are his main source of income.
  Positive
Which is likely why, instead of allowing Winehouse to take a break and get her act together, she was regularly forced to do live concerts while clearly emotionally ill-equipped to do so.
  Negative
The result is well-illustrated in the film, with the out-of-it singer simply refusing to perform at a  show in Belgrade, the first stop of an eventually cancelled European tour, to a chorus of boos and cat-calls.
  Negative
A month later, she would be gone.
  Negative
Thankfully, Amy ends on a high note, with one of her idols,  Tony Bennett, eulogizing Winehouse by placing her among the ranks of Dinah Washington, Billie Holliday and  Aretha Franklin.
  Negative
The veteran should know better than most, judging by his wonderfully gentle handling of Winehouse in earlier behind-the-scenes footage of the two of them recording the jazz standard Body and Soul at Abbey Road for his Duets II album.
  Positive
When a nervous Winehouse falters at first and haltingly asks for a do-over, the octogenarian flashes a grandfatherly smile and says, Dont worry, it always takes me a while to warm up, too.
  Positive
And warm up she does, for what pours forth out of her mouth confirms that Winehouse was the real deal.
  Positive
