This doesn't look like the  Oz I remember.
  Negative
Darn  right, I wanted to yell at the pigtailed animated -D character who  tries to pass herself off as the endearing Midwest farm girl we know  and love in  "Legends of Oz: Dorothys Return," a charmless and mirthless travesty of a sequel to the  classic " The Wizard of Oz."
  Negative
To be honest, I have not read the book "Dorothy  of Oz," written by original Oz  author Frank L. Baums great-grandson, Roger Stanton Baum that this  present-day movie is based on.
  Negative
But judging from the summaries online, I  am pretty sure that it was the filmmakers who decided that Dorothy  overloaded with Young-Adult literary heroine spunk by  Lea Michele of  TVs "Glee" should randomly wear cowboy boots, Glinda the Good Witch an  ill-used  Bernadette Peters should sound and look like an anesthetized  Barbie doll and the Winged Monkeys should sport distracting neon-hued Mohawk hairdos.
  Very negative
Instead of being the very essence of creepy this go-round, these hench simians are little more than hairy gnats just asking to be swatted away.
  Negative
None  of  these additions compensate for the rather rote narrative, off-putting  characters, awful jokes do we really need to see Toto eye a fire  hydrant with potty-time intent?
  Very negative
and a middling mish-mash of song styles that includes rock, love ballads and show tunes.
  Negative
The quality of the animation is passable, with only one memorable use of -D, but the vocal acting feels to be heavily under the influence of the louder-is-funnier school of inferior  Saturday -morning cartoons.
  Negative
Given that directors Will Finn and Dan St. Pierre are both Disney veterans, they should know better.
  Negative
Of  course, it is futile to think this effort, which picks up the story on  the day after Dorothys first trip to the Emerald City as she awakens in  her tornado-battered Kansas homestead, would ever live up to the  timelessly enchanting MGM musical with  Judy Garland.
  Negative
I tried to keep an  open mind, despite being disappointed previously in varying degrees by  such Oz-influenced movie spin-offs as " The Wiz," "Return to Oz" and the recent "Oz  the Great and Powerful."
  Negative
Probably the only way this long-running curse  will be broken is if and when they ever do a film adaptation of Broadways "Wicked," although the similar " Frozen" has already stolen some of its thunder.
  Negative
But it did not take too long to feel disheartened by what was happening onscreen, especially when the radiant symbol  of Dorothys hopes and dreams that are beyond her reach is suddenly demoted to a pedestrian form of transportation known as a rainbow mover.
  Negative
Dorothy  is summoned back by her three faithful friends from before, the  Scarecrow Dan Ackroyd, the Tin Man  Kelsey Grammer and the Lion Jim  Belushi, to once again restore order in the fantasy land that is now  under the command  of an evil Jester, the Wicked Witch of the Wests harlequin-costumed brother  Martin Short, stuck in much-too-much mode.
  Very negative
Now that each member of this trio has been previously granted a gift by the Wizard who smartly kept out  of  this picture, the supposition is that they are totally different  personalities.
  Negative
The Scarecrow with his brain is now an overbearing  know-it-all, the Tin Man with his heart is even more of  an overly sensitive drama queen and the Lion with his courage is a  brash brute bordering on a bully.
  Very negative
Whats lost from the original "Oz,"  however, is the idea that the threesome had these strengths all along  and just didnt know it.
  Negative
Now they seem like super-sized versions of their previous selves and not all that pleasant to be around.
  Negative
The device  of having characters in the Kansas sequences that later re-appear in an altered guise in Oz  is used again, most notably with the Jester.
  Negative
In the real world, he is  known as the Appraiser, an opportunist in a long purple coat who forces  the citizens of Dorothys rural community out of  their storm-damaged abodes while claiming the condemned properties for  himself.
  Negative
As Aunt Em and Uncle Henry complacently pack up to leave,  Dorothy nervily questions this interlopers authority, asking, Are you  with the government?
  Negative
The Appraiser replies with a sneer: Were  government adjacent.
  Negative
This exchange as well as the ending  of the movie suggests some sort of hidden political agenda is afoot, although what it is exactly is not clear.
  Negative
Once Dorothy arrives in  Oz,  she proceeds to basically repeat her previous journey by following the  Yellow Brick Road, although with different stopping points Candy  County, Dainty China Country and new companions.
  Negative
They include a  chubby owl named Wiser  Oliver Platt, a kindly marshmallow guard Hugh  Dancy, a china doll princess  Megan Hilty of  TVs "Smash," who at least sings heartily and a talking tree Patrick  Stewart who generously allows himself to be used for a boat.
  Negative
Meanwhile, the Jester employs his sisters broom and crystal ball to change various  Oz VIPs into marionettes and imprison them in boxes, including Glinda.
  Negative
Its only a matter of time before the good guys save the day under  minutes, thank goodness.
  Positive
I am guessing toddlers who have yet to be exposed to "The Wizard  of Oz"  will be the only satisfied customers, although the little ones in my  audience barely made a peep throughout the running time.
  Negative
This is one of  those movies that parents will have to ask themselves if they love  their child enough to sit through it.
  Positive
At least " The Nut Job" is off the  hook as the worst indie-made animated feature of the year.
  Negative
