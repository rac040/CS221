The reason why  HotelTransylvania  exists is a simple one.
  Neutral
The original  animated comedy about a resort that caters to famous monsters managed to draw ,, in worldwide box-office blood.
  Positive
Though I'm a longtime supporter of animated features, the recent need to churn out follow-ups to every cartoon hit only demeans a genre that thrives on imaginations, and is also aimed at impressionable children.
  Negative
Children should be taught to want better, not just more of the same in lesser form.
  Negative
Yes, the  Toy Story series is an exception.
  Neutral
But why the need for  Cars  except to sell more tie-in merchandise?
  Neutral
This time out,  Adam Sandler co-writes with returning joke meister  Robert Smigel.
  Negative
That Smigel sired Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog pretty much earns him a lifetime pass from me, even if this subpar sequel barely comes close to being as amusing as any run-of-the-mill Munsters TV episode.
  Negative
For Sandler, however, this is not-so-funny business as usual.
  Negative
So what is the plot, you might be frightened to ask?
  Neutral
Draculas daughter Mavis  Selena Gomez weds her human beau Jonathan  Andy Samberg and the hotelopens its doors to mere mortals for the first time in the form of her in-laws  Megan Mullally and  Nick Offerman, pocketing a paycheck.
  Negative
She gives birth to a son, Dennis, who sports a chrysanthemum bush of red curls.
  Positive
Or, as meddlesome Papa Drac likes to call him, Denisovich.
  Neutral
The rest of this anemic mixed-marriage soap opera pivots on whether Dennis will grow up to be a chip off the old bat his granddad hopes he is just a late fanger and if Mavis will decide to move her brood to sunny California, even if she doesnt know Santa Claus from Santa Cruz.
  Negative
To speed up matters, Dracula takes his grandson along with several of his ghoulish buddies, including  Steve Buscemis Wolfman,  Kevin James as Frankenstein and  David Spades Invisible Man, on a road trip to the same vampire summer camp he attended to get training.
  Negative
If this all sounds rather dull, that is because it is.
  Negative
Judging by the youngsters in the crowd, all this boo-ha-ha failed to produce non-stop hilarity as director  Genndy Tartakovsky once again relies on manic slapstick gags that rarely summon all but the briefest of chuckles.
  Negative
The kids seemed most pleased by a nearly mute green tub of jiggly goo known as Blobby, who can suck up random objects like squirrels into his tummy and urinate with multiple streams.
  Negative
I kept myself preoccupied by trying to mine some good in the bad, although having to sit through the lamest Count Chocula reference ever made it difficult.
  Negative
Gomezs youthful delivery is refreshing amidst the horror shtick.
  Positive
I like hearing Buscemis deadpan coming out of a beast who cant control his animal instincts.
  Negative
I didnt mind  Jon Lovitz, who previously spoke for Quasimodo, doing a riff on the Phantom of the Opera as a kind of Greek chorus.
  Negative
Also on the upside: A sweet wolf girl named Winnie voiced by Sandlers daughter, Sadie, who takes a shine to Dennis, delivers a rather pointed pro-female statement.
  Positive
Thats before she goes back to licking her would-be boyfriends face.
  Negative
I also got my hopes up when  Mel Brooks distinctive kvetching poured forth from Vlad, Draculas Nosferatu-style father, who is less than thrilled to have a human in the family.
  Negative
Here is a spoof king who knows how to milk mirth from old Hollywood tropes.
  Neutral
But his entrance comes too late to do anything to elevate the proceedings.
  Negative
I'm sad to report that the ending complete with the most clichd way to conclude any animated film, a musical number leaves the door wide open for the inevitable  HotelTransylvania .
  Negative
Me, I have already checked out.
  Negative
