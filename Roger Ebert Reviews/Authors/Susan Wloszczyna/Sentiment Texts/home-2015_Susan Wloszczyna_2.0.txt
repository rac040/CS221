While watching Home, a comical animated spin on alien-attack thrillers with the usual tacked-on touchy-feely messages, I began to get bored as did the families seated around me.
  Negative
Rare is the child-filled theater that falls silent during the opening minutes of any movie, especially when they should have been laughing at  Steve Martins supposed wild-and-crazy vocals as Smek, the daffy leader of a nomadic race of pastel-hued outer-space blobs known as the Boov.
  Negative
Then I started to grow nostalgic.
  Neutral
Before donning cheap plastic -D glasses was considered de rigueur and when artists still prided themselves on drawing images by hand, Disney made a brave move and released the two-dimensional Lilo amp' Stitch in  just as the computerized revolution that began with  Toy Story and continued with  Shrek and  Ice Age was about to make such non-CG cartoon titles nearly obsolete.
  Negative
Somehow, this disarming story about a lonely orphaned Hawaiian girl whose best pal is an ill-tempered fugitive space creature that looks like a mutant koala bear and acts like  John Belushi at an all-day buffet found its way into the hearts of moviegoers.
  Positive
It didnt rely on a green ogre picking wax out of his trumpet ears or a squirrel-rat being continually tortured by the forces of nature.
  Negative
The charming oddity managed to capture the spirit of the islands by extolling the concept of ohana, which celebrates family and unity, while spinning  Elvis Presley oldies on its soundtrack.
  Positive
Whatever sci-fi elements were involved were kept to a minimum.
  Neutral
Instead, the focus was on appealing characters, relatable relationships and delightful forays into Polynesian kitsch.
  Positive
And, despite being an underdog, the low-tech Oscar nominee for best animated feature ended up saying aloha to  million in ticket sales worldwide.
  Negative
How the animation world has changed and not always for the better.
  Negative
I kept thinking about Lilo amp' Stitch while watching Home, a decidedly disappointing effort based on the popular kid-lit book The True Meaning of Smekday from the already embattled folks at DreamWorks Animation.
  Negative
After  How to Train Your Dragon  lost to Disneys  Big Hero  at the Academy Awards and  Penguins of Madagascar underperformed last fall, the studio needed its lone offering this year to be a substantial leap forward instead of this obvious exercise in playing it safe.
  Negative
I longed for relief from all the relentless joking, the antsy visuals overflowing with bubbles and the frantic pacing as the Boov overtake Earth and kick humans to the curb.
  Negative
Much of the plot is amazingly similar to Lilo amp' Stitch: Tip voiced with verve by Rihanna, a pre-teen girl originally from Barbados who somehow evaded the intergalactic interlopers, encounters a socially awkward Boov named Oh  Jim Parsons from TVs The Big Bang Theory.
  Negative
Oh, who eschews contractions when he speaks a lot of do nots and cannots in a supposedly amusing patois, is on the run after mistakenly alerting his races mortal enemy to the location of their new digs.
  Negative
Besides surviving on what looks like cans of Chef Boyardee, Tip is desperate to find her mother  Jennifer Lopez  who was whisked away to an unknown locale with the rest of humanity.
  Negative
That leads her to initially mistrust Oh and lock him in a convenience store cooler.
  Neutral
He cutely stares through the glass and asks repeatedly, Can I come in from the out now?
  Negative
While most of the Boov tend to be cowardly and lack the personal skills needed to make friends, they are quite adept when it comes to gadgets and useful tools.
  Negative
Oh wins Tip over by reconfiguring her damaged car into a flying vehicle by using the stores snack machines, with slushie drinks providing the fuel.
  Negative
Consider that one of the flavors is called Busta Lime, a gag repeated at least three times, and that will tell you all you need to know about the level of the humor.
  Negative
From there, Home turns into a globe-spanning road trip adventure shared by the Tip, her cat named Pig and Oh.
  Neutral
What I wanted to do was to get to know Tip and Oh a bit better before they got to gawk at a Boovified Statue of Liberty and endanger the Eiffel Tower.
  Negative
But mostly they argue incessantly and quite loudly until they naturally become bosom buddies.
  Negative
There are some clever moments, such as Ohs big dance number to Stargates Dancing in the Dark.
  Positive
However, we then have to listen to Tip say, Shake your Boov thing.
  Neutral
Matters could be worse.
  Negative
Oh in the book is named wait for it J. Lo.
  Neutral
One assumes that is why Ms. Lopez was hired since she gets only a handful of lines and sings one song on the soundtrack Rihanna, however, gets a bunch of tunes.
  Negative
Mostly, I was disturbed by some story points that should have been addressed from the beginning.
  Negative
Yes, the Boov can manipulate gravity to their advantage.
  Negative
But since when do Earthlings simply act like sheep and not rebel when outsiders force them into mass captivity?
  Neutral
Did no one even attempt to fight back?
  Negative
Did the president or the military just surrender?
  Negative
Strangely, when we are shown where they are exiled, it appears to be a theme park dubbed Happy Humantown with rides, ice cream cones and smiling faces.
  Negative
And why is Tip apparently the only one who managed to avoid being sucked up into a giant vacuum tube and taken away by these creatures who look like a cross between a jellyfish and an eraser?
  Negative
You do not submit, people.
  Negative
Has no one seen  War of the Worlds or, if they have more arcane tastes, Mars Attacks!?
  Negative
It is too bad that Home isnt better since it does offer a much-needed break from one unfortunate tradition at DreamWorks.
  Negative
Tip is not just one of the studios few female main characters I count two others: Susan aka Ginormica in  Monsters vs. Aliens and Gloria the hippo in the  Madagascar series.
  Negative
She is the first female lead of color, complete with beautiful natural hair and real-girl body proportions.
  Very positive
As it concluded with another dance number, of course, because you got to shake that Boov thing as much as possible, Home did make me appreciate one thing: Being able to head back to my home and dig out my copy of Lilo amp' Stitch.
  Positive
