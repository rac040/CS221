But  leave it to "Will amp' Grace" graduate  Megan Mullally, who certainly  knows her way around a gay joke, to take the MVP title as Brent's  over-zealously supportive mother.

To console her son after Tanner steals  his spotlight, she organizes a parent-child night of bonding over such  queer cinema classics as " Milk", " Boys Don't Cry" and, yes, "Brokeback  Mountain".
