With a title as intriguingly enigmatic as Infinitely PolarBear, it is hard to surmise exactly what awaits plotwise.
  Negative
Rest assured that this is not a documentary that exploits the cute factor of cold-climate animals.
  Negative
Instead, this festival-circuit sleeper is one of those to-be-treasured indie films that revels in real life with all its inherent messiness while sneakily giving your heartstrings a tug.
  Negative
Not that its star,  Mark Ruffalo who continues to be cinemas leading purveyor of rumpled bed-headed sexiness, a status he first achieved in s  You Can Count on Me isnt often cuddly in the extreme.
  Negative
But his rather startling early entrance in this keenly observed and understated late-s-era dramedy about an unconventional mixed-race family and their struggle to stick together initially suggests his unhinged Cam Stuart might be one of the most petrifying patriarchs since  Jack Nicholson grabbed an ax in  The Shining.
  Negative
This troubled soul wobbles into view atop a bicycle while wearing bright red undies, a matching headband and nothing else, even though it is winter.
  Negative
Spying distraught wife Maggie the languid and lovely  Zoe Saldana, who for once isnt sporting a green or blue alien hue and their two grade-school-age daughters, Amelia and Faith, as they are about to escape in a car, this wild-eyed mad man starts banging on the windshield and yanks out the distributor cap from under the hood.
  Negative
The episode ends with a deflated Cam sitting cross-legged on the ground, emotionally spent and shivering.
  Negative
A prologue consisting of fuzzy Super  home-movie footage already has us expecting the worse as it reveals that Cam, the scion of a once-celebrated blue-blood New England clan, was diagnosed with manic-depressive disorder in .
  Negative
And that Maggie married him anyway, given that everyone was basically a some sort of mental case back in the s. However, this extreme meltdown in  lands Cam in a hospital, where such meds as Lithium have left him benign to the point of being comatose and barely able to light his endless chain of cigarettes.
  Negative
When his family visits, it is very sad affair until one of the girls notices her fathers treatment-induced bloated belly and punches it on a dare.
  Negative
An arcane throwaway line in which he warns her that just such a blow caused Harry Houdini to die suggests there is more to this shaky Cam and to Infinitely PolarBear, a garbled play on bipolar than meets the eye.
  Negative
There is an intoxicating authenticity and welcome low-key humor to what happens during the rest of this episodic story that manages to gently touch upon societal shifts, the class system, corporate sexism and racial identity as it shows how even an emotionally damaged adult can still summon enough caring and devotion be an effective primary caretaker.
  Positive
Thats not surprising since screenwriter and first-time feature director  Maya Forbes based the events on her own childhood in Cambridge, Mass.
  Negative
She and younger sister China, a lead singer for the cocktail-lounge-inspired Pink Martini, were raised by their charismatic though often erratic father while their breadwinner mother went to New York for a year and a half to earn her MBA at Columbia in the hopes of raising her familys standard of living.
  Positive
While that decision might be considered an admirable one, it also could be a recipe for disaster given Cams regular rage-induced outbursts that are only occasionally tempered by drugs and, as he admits, small sips of beer.
  Negative
Living in a cramped and cluttered apartment with two rambunctious and highly opinionated pre-adolescent girls would test anyones patience, although most parents probably wouldnt leave their kids alone while issuing the warning, If a rapist knocks, dont let them in, before heading out to a late-hours drinking hole.
  Very negative
On top of that, Cam is a little too eager to be friends with the neighbors, offering to not just carry a ladys laundry but to fold it for her as well.
  Negative
He tends to swan about a bit with a patrician air of course, he owns a smoking jacket that is part and parcel of his breeding although complications make his distant familys wealth mostly off limits.
  Negative
But Cam can also be surprisingly resourceful.
  Positive
He is an ace with fixing gadgets, can make a mean batch of crepes, has a childlike appreciation of playtime, knows martial arts, heals a rift between the girls and bullying neighbor children and even pulls an all-nighter to sew a wonderful flamenco skirt for Faith to wear in her schools talent show.
  Very positive
Basically, Cam is one of the most entertainingly inappropriate guardians for impressionable youths since Auntie Mame.
  Negative
Thats in large part due to Forbes decision to cast Ruffalo, who channels a nervous kinetic energy into his performance that is rightfully grating and ingratiating at the same time without wearing out his welcome.
  Negative
The film is worth seeing just to observe the actor as he masterfully ties a bow tie without a mirror after Cam fails to meet a restaurants dress code, all the while carrying on a heated conversation with Maggie.
  Positive
The novice director also made another wise move by having her own -year-old daughter,  Imogene Wolodarsky, play Amelia who is based on Forbes herself.
  Positive
What could be deemed nepotism is instead a perfect fit that results in a magical connection between actress and character.
  Positive
Equally good is  Ashley Aufderheide as Faith.
  Negative
While Ruffalo is the main event as his shifting moods swirl around him, we also have to believe that these girls could not only survive such an upbringing but also be surrogate parents to their needy father as well.
  Negative
Mission accomplished.
  Positive
When it became obvious that the conclusion was nigh, however, I had a reaction that I rarely feel these days.
  Negative
I wasnt ready to leave this complicated clan behind just yet.
  Negative
I wished that the -minute Infinitely PolarBear was longer.
  Negative
This might be the first time ever I knocked off a half of a star from a rating because the ending had arrived too soon.
  Negative
