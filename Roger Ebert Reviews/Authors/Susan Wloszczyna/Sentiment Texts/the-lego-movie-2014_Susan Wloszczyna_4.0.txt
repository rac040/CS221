Everything in "The Lego Movie" is, indeed, awesome.
  Positive
Awesome as in imagine if " Toy Story" were spoofed by  Mel Brooks after he ate magic mushrooms while reading George Orwell's .
  Negative
Awesome as in the sort of silly yet wily kid-appropriate PG-rated performance by  Will Ferrell that you've been waiting for ever since " Elf" came out more than a decade ago.
  Negative
Awesome as in geeking out over the sight of a grim little Batman hitching a ride on the Millennium Falcon piloted by a smart-ass little Han Solo with a suavely plastic Lando Calrissian in a flash of a cameo.
  Negative
To be honest, my enthusiastic reaction might be slightly skewed by the fact that "Everything Is Awesome" is both the title and most insidious lyric of a catchier-than-a-Norovirus musical number whose sweeping camerawork over a Lego-ized cityscape is almost as impressive as the opening sequence of " West Side Story".
  Positive
Somehow, the dastardly ditty has taken up permanent residence in my brain, snaking into the cubby hole previously occupied by the Pee-wee's Playhouse TV-show theme.
  Negative
Normally, I oppose the trend of plaything-based moviemaking, especially when the results are as brain-numbingly awful as " Transformers", "G.I. Joe" and " Battleship".
  Neutral
But if those uninspired efforts had featured not just Michelangelo the Teenage Mutant Ninja but also Michelangelo the ultimate Renaissance artist as they fight for the greater good of interlocking mankind, maybe they would have changed my mind, too.
  Negative
Besides, with so many animation powerhouses settling for easy-money sequels lately we mean you, Pixar, DreamWorks, Universal and  th  Century Fox, it is exceedingly cool that a major-studio family film refuses to simply capitalize on merchandising spinoffs by offering an oppressive -minute commercial.
  Negative
Instead, "The Lego Movie" manages to be a smartly subversive satire about the drawbacks of conformity and following the rules while celebrating the power of imagination and individuality.
  Positive
It still might be a -minute commercial, but at least it's a highly entertaining and, most surprisingly, a thoughtful one with in-jokes that snap, crackle and zoom by at warp speed.
  Positive
This surreal -D computer-animated pop-cultural cosmos overseen by directorsco-writers  Phil Lord and  Chris Miller, the talented team behind 's "Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs", takes off from those countless amateur fan-produced stop-motion films found online before concluding with rather ingenious live-action interlude.
  Negative
For once, an overly familiar plot is intended to be overly familiar as this action comedy lampoons nearly every fantasy-sci-fi-comic-book-pirate-cowboy movie clich that has been in existence at least since  George Lucas and  Steven Spielberg turned Hollywood into a blockbuster-producing boy-toy factory.
  Negative
Our unlikely hero is Emmet earnestly and engagingly voiced by  Chris Pratt of TV's "Parks and Recreation", an unremarkable construction worker who is perfectly happy with his staid generic existence as an ordinary citizen of the metropolis of Bricksburg.
  Negative
As is the custom among his peers, Emmet doesn't just avoid overthinking.
  Negative
He barely thinks at all.
  Negative
But after dawdling on a work site after hours, Emmet finds himself tumbling into an underworld where a wise Obi-Wan Kenobi-type wizard named Vitruvius  Morgan Freeman, mocking his history of movie mentorships mistakenly declares him to be the Special, the greatest Master Builder of them all.
  Negative
Unfortunately, special is exactly what Emmet isn't and he appears to be ill-equipped to battle the monstrous foe at hand.
  Negative
That would be Ferrell's President Business, a maniacal manipulator whose looming overlord alter-ego is a sly nod at the actor's despot in " Megamind".
  Negative
The minute that a swivel-headed henchman named Bad CopGood Cop starts spouting menacing threats in Liam Neeson's Irish-inflected rumble, you know that a "release the Kraken!"
  Negative
joke can't be far behind.
  Negative
And "The Lego Movie" does not disappoint, as Ferrell's control-freak villain aims to glue all the pieces of the city in place permanently no freeform deviations allowed.
  Negative
From there, Emmet and would-be love interest Wyldstyle a tough-chick cross between " The Matrix"'s Trinity and  Joan Jett blessed with Elizabeth Banks's vocal spunk enter a surreal hodge-podge universe where Lord of the Rings-style warriors, Star Wars and Harry Potter characters, superheroes, Abraham Lincoln and even basketball star  Shaquille O'Neal a legacy of an actual  NBA-sanctioned Lego set join forces to foil President Business's nefarious plan.
  Negative
It isn't fair to reveal what happens next, other than to say that it continues to be, yes, awesome despite a paucity of female characters toothache-sweet Unikitty who presides over Cloud Cuckoo Land doesn't quite count and maybe a bit too much crash-boom bombast.
  Negative
Alas, I would be remiss if I didn't issue a heads-up to parents: "The Lego Movie"'s tie-ins include  new building sets and  new characters.
  Neutral
To ensure that your child's college fund is safe and your bills get paid this month, I would urge you to seek out a theater in a galaxy far, far away from a toy store.
  Negative
