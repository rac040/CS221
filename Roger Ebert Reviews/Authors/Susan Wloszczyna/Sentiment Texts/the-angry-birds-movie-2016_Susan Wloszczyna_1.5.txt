I am a grown woman who has played a Facebook version of Angry Birds since its inception.
  Negative
Judge me if you must, but suddenly that wasted time has come in somewhat handy now that the inevitable The Angry Birds Movie has landed.
  Negative
I compete against strangers in weekly tournaments by launching flightless birds of varying shapes, hues and special combative powers via a slingshot and aiming them at snorty green pigs.
  Negative
If you asked me which one is my favorite bird, I would pick Bomb voiced by  Danny McBride in the film because, you know, explosions.
  Negative
And I become an angry lady whenever my ranking slips from the gold league to silver.
  Negative
Do I care if the birds have personalities or backstories?
  Neutral
Not really.
  Neutral
I just want these furious fowl to smash into the obnoxious little green porkers while racking up a big score.
  Negative
Its a very shallow relationship but probably the longest one I have had with a game since I spent an entire summer trying to beat my friend Angela at lawn darts.
  Negative
The Angry Birds Movie isnt a total turkey.
  Negative
The animation itself is OK and I did laugh out loud once when a poem written by Bomb rhymed hate with detonate.
  Negative
But it sure has a surfeit of derivative stuffing amid all the frantic chaos in an attempt to distract from the fact that there isnt much that's inventive or even funny here.
  Negative
Instead of simply catapulting myriad puns, bathroom-related jokes and a hodgepodge of soundtrack songs a Limp Bizkit cover of  The Whos somber Behind Blue Eyes and Tone-Locs sexy  Wild Thing alongside Demi Lovatos sprightly rendition of I Will Survive and a brand-new  Blake Shelton hoedown number onto the screen, the makers of this glorified promotion for a phone app should have followed the lets-go-crazy model set forth by  The Lego Movie.
  Negative
Instead of elevating the Angry Birds concept to surreal heights of insane genius, the filmmakers settle for a tale bogged down by familiar themes plucked from much better films.
  Negative
In the Scrat-inspired opening, our hero Red  Jason Sudeikis, speaking for the games most ineffectual pig attacker races through a jungle on Bird Island carrying an egg-shaped object that holds a cake while encountering obstacles that inflict bodily abuse.
  Negative
Turns out he is a party clown for hire with a short fuse who misses a deadline for delivering the hatchday treat.
  Negative
He gets violently mad when his customers arent pleased and the law gets involved, sentencing him to you guessed it an anger management class.
  Negative
Its there where he meets Bomb and Chuck, a speedy big-beak yellow bird  Josh Gad aka Olaf the Snowman from  Frozen, and Terence, the games rotund red bird who mainly elicits guttural responses in the manner of Lurch from  The Addams Family TV show.
  Negative
That this round mound of moroseness is voiced by an actor with a rep for hot-headed outbursts  Sean Penn is as clever as The Angry Bird Movie gets.
  Negative
We also meet the token lead female character, the games butt-bombing white bird known as Matilda  Maya Rudolph, a calm Zen-like instructor who will eventually summon her inner warrior.
  Negative
Meanwhile, we learn that Red was subjected to cruel mockery as a child, much of it aimed at his Eugene Levy-size bushy black brows.
  Negative
His downbeat attitude doesnt help him fit in with the cheery flock of fellow island dwellers, who shun him as an outsider.
  Negative
His skepticism reaches new heights when a pair of pigs, the smooth-talking Leonard  Bill Hader and his piglet-size sidekick Ross  Tony Hale, arrives in a pirate-like boat.
  Negative
While the other birds buy into the porcine intruders offer of friendship, Red goes into Chicken Little mode as he realizes the pigs want to kidnap their eggs in other words, their children.
  Negative
But everyone else is having too much fun partying down with the intruders to notice.
  Negative
That is a rather grave premise to stick into the middle of a movie aimed at youngsters.
  Negative
But perhaps even more concerning is a comic lowlight involving a washed-up mythic figure and one-time hero known as Mighty Eagle  Peter Dinklage.
  Positive
Hes a Wizard of Oz type whose rep for greatness is currently undeserved.
  Negative
His most memorable contribution: a rather off-putting depiction of the aged bird relieving himself for what seems to be an eternity into a lake where Bomb and Chuck have just been frolicking, much to their disgust.
  Positive
The finale results in a free-for-all that basically emulates the actual game in frenetic fashion.
  Positive
But the real assault is the number of lame wordplay gags aimed at the audience.
  Negative
When a fish attaches himself to Reds behind, he issues this insult: Bottom feeder.
  Negative
When an endless line of hatchlings fill up a crosswalk and block Reds way, his response is, Have you ever thought of bird control?
  Negative
Then there are the jokes that pop up in passing: A poster for  Kevin Bacon in Hamlet, a book titled  Shades of Green, a ham radio, a sign for free-rage chicken, a pig version of the twin girls from  The Shining and the all-too-expected Green Ham and Eggs reference as well as a side mention of  Jon Hamm.
  Negative
However, The Angry Birds Movie did leave me wondering if something deeper was implied as the birds are eventually won over by Red and adopt his get-mad stance as they finally fight back.
  Neutral
Is the film attempting to do to anger what  Inside Out did for sadness?
  Neutral
In other words, legitimize the emotion for children?
  Negative
Maybe, especially when a scene materialized at the end that suggested a sequel is possible.
  Neutral
Now that really fires up my ire.
  Positive
