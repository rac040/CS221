Before watching The Lady in the Van, be forewarned that you're about to be subjected both verbally and, more regretfully, visually to the none-too-tidy lavatory habits of an elderly British vagrant who resides in her vehicle and rarely has an actual bathroom at her disposal.
  Negative
The upside is that said lady is brought to life by the magnificent  Maggie Smith, who has previously inhabited this hygiene-impaired creature described as an odoriferous concerto and primarily known as Miss Shepherd to acclaim both on stage and radio.
  Positive
Thankfully, there is more than a dash of Dowager Countess imperiousness lurking in this churlish ancient street urchin wrapped in dank glad rags whose face sticks out from under sundry second-hand caps and scarves like a shriveled apple doll version of E.T.
  Negative
She fully expects, nay, demands to be catered to by strangers, and cant be bothered with such niceties as please and thank you.
  Negative
Her reaction when a resident of the nouveau-riche North London enclave where she has staked her claim stops by to bestow Christmas gifts upon her?
  Neutral
Shut the door, she bellows while reclining among the scattered detritus of her four-wheeled abode.
  Negative
Im a busy woman."
  Neutral
At the very least, you do have to admire both her unmitigated gall and survival instincts.
  Positive
Miss Shepherd, whose antics are mostly based on fact, has mastered the art of preying upon the liberal guilt in the artist-laden borough of Camden.
  Positive
The only one who dares call her out on her "woe-is-me"manipulations is a market vendor  James Corden in a cameo.
  Negative
Chin up love  weve all got to go sometime.
  Positive
He then adds rather snidely as she passes by, Smells like you already have.
  Negative
But no one falls under her sway more than  Alan Bennett, the Oscar-nominated screenwriter of s The Madness of King George.
  Negative
He once again collaborates with director  Nicholas Hytner they also did s The History Boys while adapting his own play about how this titular interloper ended up residing in his driveway for  years in the s and s.
  Negative
He also is the source of not one but two characters Bennett the scribe and Bennett the man, one handling the writing details, the other his life who sarcastically goad one another like an old married couple.
  Positive
As portrayed by  Alex Jennings, the bespectacled Bennett is a fuss-budget cross between  Truman Capote the high-pitched vocal mannerisms especially and  Elton John.
  Negative
His peevish presence takes perhaps too much time away from Smith, as her characters fascinating backstory leaks out in dribs and drabs, starting with an opening scene where a fatal car accident compels her to go undercover.
  Negative
When she spies a travel guide about France during one of her brief jaunts into Bennetts quarters and suddenly begins to speak French fluently, the writer discovers there is more to this wretch than he suspected.
  Negative
But as Bennett candidly admits in his voiceovers, he and Miss Shepherd mutually benefitted from her presence in front of his house, despite the occasional run-in with bodily waste.
  Negative
He provided her with a safe and legal haven while she acted as his muse, providing endless humorous material with her rude interactions with the outside world.
  Negative
When a fellow churchgoer follows her into the confession booth and recoils from the scent she has left behind, the priest helpfully offers, Theres an air freshener behind the Virgin.
  Negative
After observing the nightly trail of attractive young men who pass by the van on the way to Bennetts door, she tells him conspiratorially, I know what they are  theyre communists!
  Negative
Thats why they come out at night.
  Negative
The homeless woman also acts as a stand-in for his own sweet mum, who ends up in a nursing home after her mental faculties begin to fade.
  Negative
There is a deeper purpose on display as this odd couple go about their business that, for the most part, helps to keep the proceedings relatively free of cheap sentimentality and twee overload.
  Positive
In this season of giving, The Lady in the Van provides an interesting take on the very act of charity and how our desire to do good often benefits us as much if not more than it does those in need.
  Positive
While the film is no  Spotlight or  Philomena, it does cast aspersions against the Catholic Church as its less-than-benevolent past dealings with Miss Shepherd are revealed.
  Negative
Still, Bennetts script overestimates how enthralling his doppelgngers are compared to Smiths note-perfect portrayal.
  Positive
He also inserts a rather distracting device in the form of  Jim Broadbent as a ridiculous Javert-like blackmailer who regularly shakes down Miss Shepherd for money.
  Negative
The ending is botched by a sudden flight of divine fancy and also some needless meta business involving his actual self showing up on screen.
  Positive
But for anyone who adores Smith which is pretty much everyone these days they will have quite a satisfying ride with this crusty grand dame behind the wheel.
  Positive
