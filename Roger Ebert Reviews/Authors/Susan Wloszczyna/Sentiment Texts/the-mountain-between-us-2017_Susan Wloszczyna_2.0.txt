She once survived a sinking ship in " Titanic."
  Neutral
He once thrived on the mean streets of Baltimore on The Wire.
  Negative
Kate Winslet and  Idris Elba should by all rights have enough dramatic weight between them to easily elevate a two-hander about strangers who must rescue themselves from a desolate snow-blanketed Utah mountain range after their charter plane crashes.
  Negative
Instead, The Mountain Between Us is a high-altitude soap opera, woozy with overly telegraphed peril and determined to make the audience root for a couple who clearly arent meant for each other and played by actors who deserve a generous C-minus in chemistry.
  Negative
In the films production notes, Elba considered dreamboat material by his many fans notes that this is his first-ever romantic lead.
  Negative
His surprising awkwardness during the films intimate moments perhaps explains why.
  Positive
What really comes between Winslets globetrotting photojournalist Alex and Elbas brain surgeon Ben as fate and bad weather bring them together isnt so much geographical but script-related.
  Very negative
Based on a novel by  Charles Martin, the screenplay is a collaboration between  Chris Weitz  About a Boy, the live-action Cinderella and J. Mills Goodloe  The Age of Adaline,  Everything, Everything.
  Negative
Ill vouch for Weitzs skills, but in the case of Goodloe, anyone who has adapted a  Nicholas Sparks novel that isnt The Notebook is suspect.
  Negative
And having seen  The Best of Me, I rest my case.
  Positive
Palestinian director  Hany Abu-Assad, the maker of two politically charged Oscar-nominated foreign films  Paradise Now and  Omar, the last featuring a love story certainly has cred.
  Positive
But he fails to achieve producer  Peter Chernins self-proclaimed vision of a romantic epic in the tradition of Dr. Zhivago and  Out of Africa.
  Negative
Compared to those classics, Mountain is more of a molehill.
  Negative
Right out of the gate, I had an uneasy feeling about TheMountain Between Us as all flights are canceled at an Idaho airport because of an incoming blizzard.
  Negative
Alex, desperate to head back to New York in time for her wedding, overhears Ben complaining that he has to operate on a young boy the next morning.
  Negative
She proposes they share a small plane for hire.
  Positive
Their pilot is  Beau Bridges, who emits good ol boy vibes as he brings his soulful-eyed golden Labrador on-board.
  Negative
That his Walter doesnt bother to file a flight plan is an all-too-convenient warning sign.
  Negative
Not long after takeoff, while flying over remote treacherous terrain packed with white stuff, Walter begins to slur his speech and Ben recognizes he is having a stroke.
  Negative
Thank goodness, I have never witnessed anyone having such an attack.
  Negative
But Bridges, perhaps making up for the brevity of his part, seems to have taken his cues from  Ian Holms Ash, the malfunctioning android in  Alien.
  Negative
The crash itself isnt all that terrifying in these days of  Flight and  Sully.
  Negative
But Walter is a goner, the dog survives and he is in better shape than Alex, who has a huge gash on her leg.
  Negative
Ben oh, thank goodness, there just happens to be a doctor in the house fixes her up as best he can before tending to his own cuts and bruises.
  Negative
The medical stuff is the easy part.
  Positive
Cooperating with someone you just met is a bit tougher.
  Negative
Once Alex wakes, she reveals herself to be someone prone to taking risks and usually trusts her instincts in tight situations.
  Positive
With no cell phone reception and with all devices that could have alerted the occasional jet overhead unfortunately out of commission, she thinks they should abandon ship and take their chances on foot.
  Very negative
The more conservative Ben, meanwhile, is less inclined to leave whats left of the aircraft and would rather stay put.
  Negative
As she heals, the pair has a get-to-know-you period.
  Positive
Oddly, Ben wears a wedding ring but does not mention his wife.
  Negative
Alex, meanwhile, knows that if she had made it to her nuptials, she would have rushed down the aisle like  Dustin Hoffman in The Graduate.
  Negative
Ben waits a beat and echoes the thoughts of many a cinephile in the theater by observing that Hoffman was trying to stop the wedding.
  Negative
For emphasis, he meekly utters, Elaine!
  Positive
That is meet-cute stuff right there but the early portion of The Mountain Between Us suggests a variation on When Harry Met Sally Namely, can a man and a woman become companions and work together for a common cause?
  Negative
That cause here beingsurvival.
  Negative
I liked that there seemed to be no lovey-dovey business at this point.
  Neutral
But then Alex looks through her camera lens and sees a metallic glint off in the distance.
  Negative
Off they go with their makeshift emotional therapy dog in tow and the days-long trek forces them to cuddle against the cold at night.
  Negative
And, all too soon, the movie takes a tumble from which it never recovers.
  Negative
I should have known when Ben early on portentously utters, A heart is nothing but a muscle that this movie, just like the plane, was destined to crash.
  Neutral
Not to spoil the ending, which is corny as a crate of Cracker Jack, but It seemed almost inevitable that Alexs perfectly nice yet bland fianc would be  Dermot Mulroney.
  Negative
For him, such roles are like  Morgan Freeman playing the president or God.
  Negative
Meanwhile, weep not for our stars.
  Negative
Winslets career overcame the laborious  Labor Day and Elba isnt going to let the deadly  The Dark Tower get him down.
  Negative
Besides, once you realize that The Mountain Between Us almost falls into the so-bad-its-good category, it just might become destined for riff-worthy cultdom.
