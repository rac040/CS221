Though Holmes showed early promise as she transitioned from TV to the big screen in s  Wonder Boys and s  Pieces of April, the now--year-old actress has had to settle for a run of thankless mother-girlfriend-wife parts including those in  Adam Sandlers wretched Jack and Jill and non-starter dystopian yarn  The Giver.But perhaps her luck is changing.
  Very negative
Last year, Holmes proved she still could stand out in an ensemblewitha juicy recurring role on Showtimes crime drama Ray Donovan," and became a first-time director with the upcoming "All We Had," which she also stars in.
  Negative
Even better, in her latest film "Touched With Fire," she delivers a beautifully understated and moving performance as a poet suffering from bipolar disorder, who falls in love witha fellow psychiatric patientwithsimilar creative passions.
  Positive
To be sure, the story is a bit of a downer, and the thematic device of manic depression inches close to overkill, as with films like " I Smile Back" or " Silver Linings Playbook."
  Negative
But writer-director  Paul Dalio backed by his New York University film school mentor and executive producer  Spike Lee manages to avoid the trap of glamorizing the illness while still illuminating why authors, poets and painters such as Lord Byron, Emily Dickinson, Van Gogh, Edvard Munch, Tchaikovsky,  Ernest Hemingway and  Virginia Woolf have been inspired by their manic episodes.
  Negative
Although not exactly based on Kay Redfield Jamisons well-regarded  book of the same name, the plot is driven by her research into how being bipolar affects artistic personalities, for good and bad, as the lead characters wrongly regard it as their excuse to toss away their meds and indulge their over-amped imaginations and bouts of insomnia.
  Negative
Nor are there any power-tripping Nurse Ratcheds to be seen, as Carla Holmes, who has published a book of her works, lands in psychiatric hospital and meets her seeming soulmate, the far more frenetic and anti-social Marco an impressive  Luke Kirby of TVs Rectify and Show Me a Hero.

  Negative
That turns out to be easier for Carla than Marco, who is convinced his illness is a gift and covets his mania.
  Negative
It is impossible not to think of similar films featuring patients withpsychological problems who are drawn into co-dependent relationships, such as the s chestnut David and Lisa or even  Girl, Interrupted.
  Neutral
But Touched WithFire is perhaps most like the cancer-themed romantic drama  The Fault in Our Stars, including an appearance by an author in this case, a cameo by Jamison revered by the central couple who turns out to be a disappointment in person.
  Negative
But while The Fault in Our Stars was a gloriously shameless high-end tearjerker, Touched With Fire acts more as a damper to such tissue-required emotions, given its rather honest portrait of such suffering.
  Negative
Some humor enters the picture early on, especially when we first meet a babbling Marco as he decides to quit his job and insists he can subsist on only ketchup and milk purloined from fast-food joints.
  Neutral
But Dalio, who is bipolar himself, takes his portrayal of the illness very seriously and leaves very little room for light-heartedness.
  Negative
What joy there is can be found in observing Holmes, haggard and subdued as she bares her soul, playing off Kirbys more animated performance as they form a realistic bond.

  Neutral
The intimacy that graces its best scenes becomes somewhat muted when the action awkwardly moves to the outside world.
  Positive
It might be opening on Valentines Day weekend, but dont mistake  TouchedWithFire for a date-night treat.
  Negative
Still, anyone who cares about Holmes will be happy to see her front, center and back in fine form.
  Positive
