In the dark of night, a striking figure decked out like a film-noir femme fatale materializes along a road side, toting leather luggage and a Singer sewing machine.
  Positive
She is clearly dressed to impress with her crimson lipstick, white gloves, cocked-just-so chapeau, wavy blonde locks and a black-and-white ensemble that conforms to her womanly shape as if it were her birthday suit.
  Negative
She takes a slow drag on her cigarette and issues this statement of intent that is more of a warning than greeting: Im back, you bastards!
  Negative
If that werent enough, a car stops and a uniformed constable gets out.
  Negative
He briefly stares before inquiring, Is that, uh  Dior?
  Negative
It's quite an entrance in quite a movie.
  Positive
However, when it comes to The Dressmaker, nothing is ever enough.
  Neutral
And that is its main problem.
  Negative
Another woman who can rightfully proclaim, Im back, is Australian director and screenwriter  Jocelyn Moorhouse.
  Negative
She made a splash in the s with Proof, How to Make an American Quilt and  A Thousand Acres, before taking time off to raise her family.
  Positive
Now,  years later , she has adapted a book by  Rosalie Ham with a script co-written by hubby P.J. Hogan of Muriels Wedding fame that is positively exploding with a surfeit of pent-up creative energy that unfortunately doesnt know when to stop.
  Negative
Not that The Dressmaker is ever dull and is even more than occasionally delightful in its nuttiness.
  Negative
This ultimately exhausting tilt-a-whirl of a revenge tale set in  that takes place in the mythical dusty Down Under hamlet of Dungatar embraces all manner of influences spaghetti Westerns, a Tim Burton-esque aesthetic, a warped world view that rivals  John Waters, a small mob of morally corrupt Dickensian-style eccentrics and a story whose wild tonal shifts range from Tex Avery cartoony to  Douglas Sirk melodramatic.
  Negative
The lady above is one Myrtle Tilly Dunnage  Kate Winslet, providing a captivating harbor in this storm of kookiness, who has returned to the community that once banished her as a child.
  Positive
She is ostensibly there to care for her dotty crank of a mother, Mad Molly a cantankerously cagey  Judy Davis, nearly unrecognizable until her character regains her wits and pretty much steals the movie, who has been living in pungent squalor.
  Negative
But Tilly also is clearly out to right some wrongs while shedding a light on a tragic incident from the past that she cant quite recall.
  Negative
All that sounds quite logical, until Tilly, who learned how to makehaute-couture designs while in Paris, hauls out her sewing machine and starts a business doing fashion makeovers for Dungatars frumpy female citizenry.
  Negative
This budding Edith Head also has an unusual way of attracting her first customers: She disrupts a rugby match by showing up in a curve-clinging scarlet gown before changing into an even more striking Rita Hayworth-inspiredblack dress eventually causing the opposing team to lose by simply stripping off its matching jacket.
  Positive
Its as if Project Runway took over the Super Bowl.
  Neutral
In the midst of all this, we are rushed through introductions to a raft of quirky characters.
  Negative
Some make an instant impression, such as Hugo Weaving's slyly campy rendition of a cross-dressing police sergeant who cant help but hungrily caress Tillys luxurious fabrics with his eyes shades of his drag queen in  The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.
  Negative
Then there is  Liam Hemsworth as hunky farmer Teddy, who quite fancies the reluctant Tilly.
  Negative
Until now, I have primarily thought of this actor as  Chris Hemsworths younger, less talented but equally strapping brother.
  Neutral
But working in his native Australia seems to have unleashed a very fetching devil-may-care nonchalance that casts quite a masculine spell.
  Negative
Also, please note that although they are meant to be contemporaries, Winslets a luscious  years old while Hemsworth is  and it doesnt make a whit of difference.
  Positive
Gender parity at its finest.
  Positive
Naturally, evil also lurks inDungatar and it takes several forms, including a hunchback town pharmacist and wife abuser who greets Tilly by hissing, Your mothers a slut and youre a bastard, the rumor-mongering female schoolteacher whose lies caused Tilly to be forced out of town and the womanizing councilman who torments his clean-freak wife.
  Negative
By the time a rival seamstress strolls into town slinging her own Singer, Moorhouse is clearly guilty of over-accessorizing her already jam-packed fable.
  Negative
Still, certain individual scenes are gems and stand out like statement pieces.
  Negative
Davis is at her riotous best when she accompanies Tilly and Teddy on a date to see  Sunset Boulevard at a local cinema.
  Positive
Mollys repulsed reaction to the gorgon-like visage of Gloria Swansons aging movie queen is beyond priceless especially when the silent-screen divaputs the moves on  William Holdens gigolo of a screenwriter, which leads her to shriek, Shes trying to kiss him.
  Negative
RUN!
  Neutral
It is heartening to see Winslet, whose big-screen efforts after her Oscar win for  The Reader have been uneven despite her supporting nod last year for  Steve Jobs, get a chance to rip into a juicy lead role.
  Negative
And, for a while, The Dressmaker pays off with its out-of-nowhere developments, until it collapses into a pit of death, destruction and despair.
  Negative
I cant say this is the best film you will see all year, but I can assure you wont see another one like it again for a long time.
  Positive
