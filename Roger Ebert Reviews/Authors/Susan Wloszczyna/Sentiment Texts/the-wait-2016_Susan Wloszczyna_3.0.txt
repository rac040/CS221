While he adopts a less in-your-face approach, Messina similarly relies on a visual language rather than words to stir emotions.
  Negative
Winding roads snaking through mountainous vistas, fog-filled nighttime passageways, darkened hallways, an immense stained-glass window mosaic done in mostly hues of blue, a calm empty expanse of water in the midday heat, the canopies of leaves in a lushly green forest nearby all relay the sense of stillness that envelops the household.

He could have chosen no better actress to further fulfill this mission than Binoche, who proved herself to be masterful at expressing the nuances of grief early in her career in s Three Colors: Blue, and more recently in  Clouds of Sils Maria.
  Negative
A mere glance or facial twitch conveys more than any outburst of dialogue could, especially when Anna re-enters Giuseppes bedroom for the first time since his demise.

  Positive
Life, for a moment, goes on.
  Positive
But instead of a miracle, Anna is confronted by her loyal yet disapproving elderly servant Pietro, who suggests she should drop the ruse.
  Negative
To fully appreciate The Wait, one should not expect grand revelations or even full knowledge of how exactly Giuseppe succumbed.
