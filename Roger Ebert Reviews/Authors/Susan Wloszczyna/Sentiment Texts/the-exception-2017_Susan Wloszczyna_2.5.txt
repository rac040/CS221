If Merchant Ivory and  Paul Verhoeven ever gave birth to a movie baby, it would probably come out looking something like The Exception.
  Negative
This tony drawing-room period piece, anchored by  Christopher Plummers wily take on an aging German monarch who longs for the past and abhors the present, is served with a side of steamy interludes of sex-laced intrigue.
  Negative
Yes, the narrative is occasionally clunky and there is often more tell than show.
  Negative
But a strong ensemble offers compensation.
  Positive
David Leveaux, a noted British stage director, wisely chose a tightly focused story as his feature debut, one that takes place at a single scenic locale an isolated countryside mansion located in the Netherlands.
  Negative
Based onThe Kaisers Last Kiss, a  fictionalized historical novel about Kaiser Wilhelm IIs waning days in exile, the drama opens in  as Hitler is busy invading European countries.
  Negative
A young German officer named Capt. Brandt  Jai Courtney, in a part that is an upgrade from the  Divergent series and  Terminator Genisys, injured in battle and with an elaborate scar to prove it, is recruited as a bodyguard to the Kaiser while gathering evidence of the dethroned rulers lack of loyalty.
  Very negative
Yes, a Nazi is our hero and rooting for him might prove a challenge.
  Negative
But Brandt also is sensitive enough to be haunted every night by the nightmarish images of a mass killing he recently witnessed that targeted women and children in Poland, so there is that.
  Negative
Soon after his arrival, a new hire in the form of a comely young maid enters his chambers and he quickly issues a command: Take off your clothes.
  Negative
She duly follows orders.
  Neutral
You might not recognize  Lily James as the dark-haired Mieke.
  Negative
Thats because the last time you probably saw her was as Disneys live-action and very blonde Cinderella, a role that required her only to lose a shoe.
  Negative
In a welcome gender-switch in the art of seduction, the next time her servant girl and Brandt have a hot-and-heavy encounter a household no-no she is the one who demands that he doffs his duds before forcefully pushing him onto the bed and taking charge of the boudoir situation.
  Negative
After Mieke confesses to her undercover lover that she is Jewish, it becomes clear she is a spy for the Dutch resistance, one that Brandt is tasked with pursuing.
  Negative
Her mere presence has already caused the Kaisers cunning wife, Princess Hermine  Janet McTeer, to be suspicious especially after she stumbles upon the maid and the captain engaged in a late-night rendezvous.
  Negative
It also doesnt help that Mieke has caught the eye of her husband, winning him over by sweetly helping him feed his ducks.
  Positive
Plummers deposed monarch, whose withered left arm doesnt stop him from chopping wood or lighting cigarettes, actually roots for this taboo twosome.
  Negative
And because he cares about their fate, we do, too.
  Negative
This Von Trapp family patriarch is more handsome than ever at , and he towers over the proceedings as a bellicose character who has no filter when it comes to criticizing Nazis in public while hoping to reclaim his seat of power in Berlin.
  Positive
The real Wilhelm II apparently was nobodys idea of a charmer, but Plummer gets away with suggesting he was.
  Positive
Matters come to a head when it is announced that the monstrous Nazi official Heinrich Himmler is paying a visit, allowing the Kaiser to believe his regal status will soon be restored.
  Negative
That doesnt stop him from bellowing, Better start counting the silver, however.
  Negative
Marvelous British character actor  Eddie Marsan the boxing brother on Ray Donovan does a bang-up job of sending a much-needed chill up the spine of the film with his insidiously subtle portrait of Himmler as a rodent-snouted personification of evil incarnate.
  Positive
His casual dinner-table discussion about exterminating disabled children with a deadly shot of fenolin into their hearts proves quite the appetite killer and a sign that his intentions are not on the up and up.
  Neutral
Eventually, the plot is tangled in shootouts and a car chase with the Kaiser, Mieke and Brandt joining forces.
  Negative
One major peeve: The accents spoken by various cast members are all over the place.
  Negative
Then again, when Courtney and James strip down, words are unnecessary.
  Negative
Would I rather be watching Verhoevens Black Book or Merchant Ivorys The Remains of the Day?
  Neutral
Of course.
  Neutral
But for Plummers plum of a performance alone, you might want to make an exception for The Exception.
  Negative
