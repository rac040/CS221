David O. Russell deserves to be counted among Hollywoods finest living filmmakers, one who appeals to mainstream tastes without having to compromise his off-kilter depictions of humanity with all its flaws.
  Positive
His record speaks for itself: Since , he has released three films   The Fighter,  Silver Linings Playbook and  American Hustle  that together grossed  million and collected  Oscar nominations.
  Negative
But back in , Russell was caught in a professional snag.
  Negative
Shooting on a political satire then-titled Nailed, loosely based on a  novel, Sammys Hill, written by  Al Gores daughter Kristin, was halted four times as financing kept running out.
  Very negative
He ultimately quit the unfinished project two years later, leaving its destiny in the hands of others, and took his name off the credits.
  Negative
Redubbed Accidental Love and with the pseudonymous  Stephen Greene listed as director, the misbegotten comedy that has been available on VOD since mid-February will finally open in limited release at theaters this weekend.
  Negative
Given Russells involvement and a fairly solid cast that includes  Jake Gyllenhaal and  Catherine Keener, just how awful could it be?
  Negative
Really awful.
  Very negative
Unwatchably awful.
  Negative
As in, Give it the Razzie now and be done with it awful.
  Negative
From its intrusively generic soundtrack heavy on cheesy strings to the painfully frantic attempts at supposed funny business consider that  Paul Reubens aka  Pee-Wee Herman provides probably the only well-modulated performance, Accidental Love could easily qualify for disaster relief.
  Very negative
The film is in trouble from the get-go with what appears to be a faux Happy Days episode as a roller-skating carhop Alice  Jessica Biel serves patrons at a s-style drive-in eatery in small-town Indiana.
  Negative
But instead of the Fonz, there is a porn-stached  James Marsden as motorcycle cop Scott, who invites Alice to a fancy restaurant that night in order to propose to her.
  Negative
But as fate  along with some odd plotting choices  would have it, a repairman holding a nail gun falls on Alice during their meal and shoots her in the head.
  Negative
Just as a surgeon  Bill Hader, who skirts by in a cameo is about to remove the foreign object, it is learned that Alice is uninsured and she has no way to pay the , bill.
  Negative
You would think that the restaurant would be held liable, but that notion is dismissed out of hand.
  Neutral
Instead, she is released with the warning that her untreated injury could cause her to fly into irrational rages, speak foreign languages in this case, Portugese and experience uncontrollable sexual urges, all of which eventually have little to no payoff in the laugh department.
  Negative
After a brief ill-advised stab at home surgery by a drunk veterinarian take pity on  Kirstie Alley, Alice decides to head off to Washington, D.C., to plead her case to her local congressman, Howard Birdwell Gyllenhaal, whose bug-eyed efforts here make his sociopathic  Nightcrawler creep seem like the essence of understatement.
  Very negative
Just because you can never have too many snicker-inducing medical conditions, Alice is accompanied by two acquaintances: a reverend with a pharmaceutically-induced constant erection  Kurt Fuller and a pal whose weight-lifting regimen has led to a collapsed anus  Tracy Morgan, all but undone by his characters witless predicament.
  Negative
At that point, Accidental Love turns into a toothless mockery of self-serving politicos that can hardly compete with the real-life partisan shenanigans that go on regularly on Capitol Hill.
  Negative
Even someone as consistently good as Keener collapses under the weight of a stiff bouffant wig and a staid Barbara Bush wardrobe as a House Whip who pushes the dopey idea of building a military base on the moon while recruiting Alice as a pawn to promote her pet project.
  Negative
As Keeners Speaker of the House rival,  James Brolin replacing  James Caan, wise enough to drop out over creative differences mainly exists to undergo a humiliating protracted death while choking on a Girl Scout cookie  or, rather, a Girl Squaw cookie as they are known in this alternate universe.
  Negative
About the only scene that rises above the haphazard rest takes place in Howards office as he becomes the beneficiary of Alices sudden bouts of lust.
  Negative
As the song At Last plays in the background, the frisky pairs arms and legs are seen flailing about as the camera circles around them.
  Negative
Too bad the mood is killed after that since Gyllenhaal who hasnt been in such an at-odds-with-itself curio since s Bubble Boy and Biel madcap is not her strong suit have zero chemistry together otherwise.
  Very negative
In the Cold War era, these sort of ensemble farces that mined humor from world events were commonplace, including s  Dr. Strangelove and s The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming.
  Negative
The difference is, they were made by filmmakers who knew what they were doing.
  Neutral
Perhaps if Russell had stayed behind the wheel, Accidental Love wouldnt have gone quite so far off course.
  Negative
You can spy why he might have been drawn to the story since his strong suits have included allowing a large cast to wildly bounce off one another  Flirting With Disaster and mining humor from topical subjects  Three Kings.
  Negative
But years later, the arrival of Obamacare has made the films central conceit of health insurance reform pretty much obsolete.
  Negative
Not only that, such inside-the-Beltway series as HBOs Veep and Netflixs House of Cards  not to mention The Daily Show already have done a pretty good job of scorching the integrity of our elected officials.
  Negative
Just when you think that the agony of Accidental Love is about to conclude, there is the ever-popular group dance number followed by a blooper reel.
  Negative
When a movie is basically one giant blooper reel, that seems terribly redundant.
  Negative
