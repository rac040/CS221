As someone who treasures her -year-old Waiting for Guffman plastic lunch box, I have been eagerly awaiting the arrival of Netflixs  Mascots.
  Negative
The fifth of filmmaker  Christopher Guests string of comical faux documentaries not counting the heavy-metal spoof " This is Spinal Tap, which he starred in and co-wrote with  Rob Reiner directing that examine insular communities whose members share an obsession includingdog-show competitors Best in Show, s folk artists The Mighty Wind, unlikely Oscar hopefuls  For Your Consideration is his first in a decade.
  Negative
That Guest uses the occasion to briefly revive his portrayal of Waiting for Guffmans fabulously flamboyant Corky St. Clair, the Broadway wannabe who ruled a small-town theater troupe like a cross between  Bob Fosse and  Dame Edna, should be reason enough to toss confetti.
  Negative
The wacky world of sports mascotsvying for the Golden Fluffy in Anaheim, Calif., at least sounds as if it should fit right into Guests formulaic sweet spot.
  Neutral
As usual, the hit-or-miss ratio of the humorous repartee relies greatly upon the improvising skills of the cast and the spontaneous off-kilter references that result.
  Negative
Those that pop up here include a religious cult based on Michael Landons s TV series Highway to Heaven, the existence of a  Rhea Perlman Middle School and, for fans of  The Alamo, a chain hotel that offers both a plush  John Wayne Suite" and a downgraded  Slim Pickens room.
  Negative
And no such effort would be complete without yet another cheerily clueless and horrifying politically incorrect  Fred Willard performance, this time as a mascotcoach who insultingly interrogates a little person Brad Williams about how he got small enough to fit into his worm get-up.
  Negative
He patiently breaks it to him that he was born this way.
  Positive
But as we are introduced to the main contestants and learn their back stories as a build-up to the main competition, the stale scent of been-there, mocked-that begins to permeate.
  Negative
Matters start off well enough as we are first introduced to two new recruits to Guests acting company:  Zach Woods, whose eyes look like two nervous fried eggs that are about to burst, and Sarah Brown as Mindy, a tightly wound bundle of spousal passive aggression.
  Negative
They can run in their turtle and octopus guises as baseball mascots, but they cant hide from the hostile undercurrents in their relationship as they talk directly to the camera.
  Negative
Mascotting is not unlike a marriage, Mike observes.
  Negative
Its about cooperation, its about listening, even if people are screaming at you, youre not allowed to talk.
  Negative
And thats a good lesson for a marriage.
  Positive
Right after this statement, we hear him nervously ask the doctor treating his sore knee if he can prescribe anti-depressants.
  Negative
Too often what should be humorous instead comes off as disturbing psycho drama, deflating potential belly laughs to mere chuckles.
  Negative
Most of the foam-headed characters engaging in this blend of cheerleading and cosplay are varying degrees of damaged goods.
  Negative
They need the validation of a trophy and they need it desperately.
  Negative
Among those we get to know are Chris ODowd, who starred in Guests HBO show Family Tree, as the self-proclaimed bad boy of mascotery whose brawling hockey-skater alter ego is a gigantic fist that comes off like an unleashed Id on steroids'  Tom Bennett also a Family Tree alum as Sid the Hedgehog, a sweet British lad who inherited the gig from his imposing dad  Jim Piddock, Guests co-writer who forbids any detours from tradition' Guest regular  Parker Posey as a fading Blanche DuBois type behind Alvin the Armadillo, who does modern dance moves and dons aviatrix headgear while representing a school named after Amelia Earhart' and  Christopher Moynihans Mario Bros.-like Jack the Plumber, most notable for injecting bathroom gags into the proceedings.
  Negative
Other returnees to the fold are the always-welcome  Jane Lynch as a haughtily entitled judge whose claim to fame as the retired Minnie the Moose was doing a split for an entire extra-inning baseball game.
  Negative
She has since found religion, as recounted in her memoir A-Moosing Grace.
  Positive
Her bitter rival is a grousing  Ed Begley Jr. as the onetime Danny the Donkey, whose groundbreaking anatomically correct costume was compensation for his own less-than-manly attributes.
  Negative
But more disappointing are  Jennifer Coolidge doing yet another variation on a trophy-wife floozy and  Bob Balaban as her sugar daddy.
  Negative
I dont know if Guest should be applauded for addressing the issue of offensive sports team names and touching upon the subculture of Furries  those who don plush animal costumes, often for sexual pleasure since these subjects dont add much to the story.
  Positive
As the pre-contest antics grew tiresome, I kept anticipating what is often the most entertaining part of these pseudo docs: Seeing the cast actually perform in an amateurish stage musical, leading prancing purebred dogs around an arena, singing and playing instruments, or appearing in an unlikely movie called Home for Purim.
  Negative
But this time, given the difficulty involved in many of the routines, costumed stunt doubles fill in instead.
  Negative
Such masked anonymity simply kills the thrill of the final outcome.
  Negative
Missing in action are two masters at bringing such improvised oddball creations to life while investing them with enough emotional depth so that we can care and root for them:  Eugene Levy and Catherine OHara, who are the king and queen of this peculiar comedy genre.
  Negative
In fact, OHara was just about the only reason to applaud For Your Consideration.
  Negative
Her portrayal of a veteran of B-grade movies who suddenly finds herself an inexplicable recipient of Oscar buzz, was as heartfelt as it was hilarious and she even managed to give herself a bad face lift by simply by shifting her own facial muscles.
  Positive
As hard as it is to admit, Guests once-incisive satirical bite has grown dull in its familiarity.
  Negative
He doesnt seem to be having as much fun here and neither are we.
  Negative
Perhaps its time to move on.
  Neutral
Besides, well always have Waiting for Guffman.
