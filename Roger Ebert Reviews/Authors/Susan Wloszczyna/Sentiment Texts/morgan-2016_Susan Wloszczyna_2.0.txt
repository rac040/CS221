Films often impart important life lessons in the guise of entertainment.
  Positive
For instance, thanks to  Oliver Stones The Hand from , I will never EVER stick my own hand out of a window while driving in a car, lest it ends up being sliced off and skedaddles away in order to commit acts of great evil.
  Negative
But one fairly consistent cinematic rule of thumb, especially in horror and sci-fi movies that range from s Frankenstein to last years  Ex Machina, is this: Do not be tempted to play God and create an artificial, human-like being.
  Negative
Such incidents of hubris almost never turn out well.
  Negative
Stick with imaginary friends if you must, although they sometimes turn out badly, too i.e. Drop Dead Fred.
  Negative
Along comes Morgan to add to the chorus of misguided scientists who have proclaimed a variation on Its alive!
  Neutral
over the years.

This cautionary thriller about the dangers of bioengineering doubles as a kind of a passing of the torch not carried by angry villagers between directors with shared DNA.
  Negative
That would be  Luke Scott, making his feature debut, and father Ridley, who acts as producer.
  Neutral
Clearly, this son, who was a second unit director on Dads " The Martian" and  Exodus: Gods and Kings, has paid attention to the old mans output over the years since Morgan is littered with obvious nods.
  Negative
But it makes sense, considering that Sir Ridleys  Alien remains one of the most influential examples of big-screen sci-fi spookiness ever made and even features a devious fake human in the form of  Ian Holms android Ash.
  Negative
In addition, Morgan concludes with a very physical face-off between two strong females not unlike the one between  Sigourney Weavers Ripley and the alien queen, while also boasting a commendably diverse cast, much like such Scott productions as The Martian and TVs  The Good Wife.
  Positive
But sometimes such formulaic familiarity proves to be a drawback in a genre that is propelled in large part by plot developments meant to catch the audience off guard.
  Negative
For instance, the minute we see the determined visage and no-nonsense coif of  Kate Maras risk-management consultant Lee Weathers as she drives down a gravel road to a remote woodsy compound, she is obviously not an entity to be messed with or taken lightly.
  Negative
Maybe too obviously.
  Neutral
Corporate, we learn, has sent her to assess the circumstances surrounding a horribly violent attack committed byMorgan, an artificial being in the guise of a fair-skinned waif of a teen girl, on one of her caretakers, behavioral psychiatrist Kathy  Jennifer Jason Leigh, with one eye obscured by a bloody bandage.
  Negative
Much like a detective, Lee meets and assesses the other members of this seven-member family-like collective who are responsible for Morgans birth five years ago and monitoring her rapid growth.
  Negative
The close-knit crew all treatMorgan who continues to evolve both physically and mentally as if they were proud parents reveling in their magical childs achievements rather than objective observers of an unknown and potentially dangerous quantity.
  Negative
Kathy even takes the blame for upsetting this nature-loving experimental being, since she toldMorganthat she was basically grounded in her glass-enclosed bunker of a room.
  Negative
Lee counters this argument in no uncertain terms, She is an it.
  Positive
And it has no rights.
  Negative
Even before Lee speaks to the rest ofMorgans emotionally-invested handlers the chief scientist in charge  Toby Jones, a doctor whoMorgan refers to as mother  Michelle Yeoh, the soft-hearted psychoanalyst  Rose Leslie who introducedMorganto the great outdoors, the projects hunky cook  Boyd Holbrook and three other staffers she appears ready to pull the plug onMorgan.
  Negative
Meeting her face-to-face through protective glass doesnt change her mind.
  Neutral
When an outside shrink arrives and demands to enterMorgans space without protection to better determine whether she is malfunctioning, it is all but certain that the session is not going to end well onceMorganbegins to taunt him about his unhappy personal life.
  Negative
That he is played by  Paul Giamatti, who specializes in roles that require blowing ones stack, means his very presence is like tossing a stick of lit dynamite into a building already engulfed in flames.
  Negative
My diagnosis of why Morgan malfunctions as a chilling plunge into blood-splattered mayhem is that, before the midway point, it is pretty obvious what the eventual outcome and supposed big reveal will be.
  Negative
This is not the fault of the actors necessarily there are highly respected talents involved here.
  Negative
It is just that we have seen most of this unfold before.
  Negative
What does work isMorganherself or, rather, itself.
  Negative
If you overlook the overdone pasty sheen of her face and the obvious ghoulish lipstick on her lips,  Anya Taylor-Joy the star of this years truly creepy  The Witch imbues her character with an intriguing newborn-like aura, a calm if unsettling speech pattern and a tendency to explode into a terrifying fury within seconds Then there are her alien reptile eyes, peering into the naked psyches of those who dare confront her.
  Negative
Basically, if you end up liking Morgan, it will probably be because of Taylor-Joy.
  Negative
I do have to get one small peeve off my chest.
  Negative
It seemed odd that the younger Scott decided to focus his camera on Lees New York license plate for so long during her arrival.
  Neutral
It felt as if he were trying awfully hard to convince us that we were upstate somewhere in the wilds.
  Negative
Sure enough, Morgan was shot in Northern Ireland.
  Negative
I can spot blarney when I see it.
  Positive
