I have a weird confession.
  Neutral
I am watching "Earth to Echo," this utterly shameless sci-fi fantasy rip-off of "E.T." and almost every kid-friendly film that  Steven Spielberg has ever produced andor directed or even just thought about producing andor directing.
  Negative
The premise?
  Neutral
Three pubescent boys in a Nevada subdivision that is about to be demolished to make way for a freeway yeah, right, wink, wink suddenly receive a weird image on their smartphones the day before they must move.
  Negative
One of these social misfits, whose tech savvy and amusing awkwardness make up for what they lack in cool, announces that he has determined the exact nature of this mysterious object.
  Positive
Now, to me, since it is shaped like an inverted triangle with rounded edges, it looks similar to those diagrams of the female reproductive system that often show up in the examining rooms of gynecologists.
  Neutral
It has to be a uterus, right?
  Neutral
Complete with ovaries and Fallopian tubes.
  Neutral
OK, I did go for my annual exam recently and such matters are in the forefront of my mind, so dont judge me too harshly.
  Positive
But, suddenly, I was hoping that this was going to be quite a boldly original coming-of-age story.
  Positive
Not a chance.
  Neutral
Instead, the blob on their phone ends up being just a map to a desolate area in the desert where a battered, wee, owl-like alien covered in what appears to be metal armor has crashed.
  Negative
Given that it beeps, chirps, repeats sounds and is incredibly cute, this visitor from outer space dubbed Echo after suggestions of Space Ninja and Master Blaster earn a thumbs-down is a descendent of Tribbles, Gremlins, the " Short Circuit" robot No.
  Negative
, "WALL-E," Bubo from s "The Clash of the Titans" and maybe even Chucky the psycho doll.
  Negative
All I know is, Furbys definitely have grounds for a copyright lawsuit.
  Positive
The constant plundering from such sources as "Goonies," "Stand by Me," " Close Encounters of the Third Kind," " Poltergeist" and " Super ," a superior Spielberg homage in itself, obscures the one original twist that "Earth to Echo" does bring to the table.
  Positive
We are witnessing the birth of selfie cinema.
  Negative
On the surface, it seems "Earth to Echo" is simply the first found-footage film, a money-saving format popularized by s " The Blair Witch Project" and capitalized on by the more recent " Paranormal Activity" franchise, tamed down for grade-school audiences.
  Negative
And video cameras are duly employed handheld, attached to bikes and even one tucked inside a pair of horn-rimmed nerd glasses that might have been borrowed from  Michael Caine circa "The Ipcress File."
  Negative
The trio of best buddies wannabe filmmaker and big mouth Tuck Brian Astro Bradley, who apparently was on "The X Factor", comical gadget whiz and self-described acquired taste Munch Reese Hartwig and earnest emo foster child Alex  Teo Halm are not just recording their last night together to share their incredible escapades with the world on YouTube after they ride their bikes  miles to check out where the map leads.
  Negative
They are also offering proof that they arent invisible, despite the way the bullies and popular students in school mistreat or ignore them, by making themselves the stars of their movie.
  Negative
Isnt that why people post their pouty self-portrait poses on Facebook?
  Negative
To prove that they matter?
  Neutral
True, the threesome in "Earth to Echo" may not stand around taking photos of themselves with their phones, but they are achieving the same goal by keeping a record of their own reactions to the strange events: Confirming that they exist and forcing others acknowledge their importance in the world as well.
  Negative
Much of the movie is devoted to the guys helping Echo find missing parts so he can, like E.T., go home.
  Positive
They use a sleepover as an excuse to stay up all night while going to various locales as suggested by their alien buddy.
  Negative
They visit a barn, a pawn shop, a bar and a high-school party, with varying degrees of disruptive results.
  Negative
They also drive a car for the first time with the aid of Googled instructions.
  Neutral
Now, is it just me or is this not a good idea in a film aimed at impressionable youngsters under ?
  Negative
Especially if there isnt going to be an intergalactic bird on board who can dismantle a truck and then reassemble it so it doesnt hit you head on admittedly, a pretty neat visual trick.
  Negative
Echo can be entertaining in his reactions and the relationship between the boys at first feels organic and unforced.
  Positive
But there are a few illogical detours.
  Negative
What fuddy-duddy parents in this day and age spend an evening forcing their middle-school-age daughter to wear a pink prom-style party dress while tutoring her on etiquette?
  Negative
Shouldnt they be watching a TV show with "SVU" or "CSI" in the title instead?
  Negative
Sounds like the authorities should be alerted to this kind of Miss Manners-inspired abuse.
  Negative
Echo at least provides a reason for pretty classmate Emma Ella Linnea Wahlestedt, whom Munch refers to as Mannequin, to escape and join the three amigos.
  Negative
Of course, this token girl mainly serves to show the boys a thing or two about breaking the rules and being brave without quite being a fully realized character herself.
  Neutral
Meanwhile, save for a scowling road-project construction worker  Jason Gray-Stanford, who obviously isnt one because he is behaving in a manner not unlike the government agents who go after E.T., adults are given short shrift.
  Negative
Mainly, they are oddly lackadaisical about their parental duties and generally clueless a sleepover the day before a move is another bad idea.
  Negative
It was nice to see Gray-Stanford who was Lt. Randy Disher on the now-defunct "Monk" detective series as the token meanie.
  Neutral
Sadly, I dont think his role is substantial enough to be described as acting.
  Negative
What ultimately should have been borrowed from Spielbergs oeuvre but isnt is a sense of wonder and achievement whenever characters come in contact with the unknown or overcome a great obstacle as a team.
  Neutral
Imitation should be flattering, not flattening.
  Negative
