The first time I stumbled upon  Clint Eastwood in a film, it wasnt a spaghetti Western or even his earliest-credited role in Francis in the Navy, a talking-mule comedy.
  Negative
It was a Southern Gothic drama with Freudian undertones set during the final days of the Civil War from  titled The Beguiled," directed by  Don Siegel, whose more influential  Dirty Harry, also starring Eastwood, arrived in theaters the same year and made anti-hero cop history.
  Negative
The Beguiled felt quite provocative to this high-school sophomore although, in terms of worldliness, I am pretty sure I had read my mothers copy of  Valley of the Dolls by then.
  Negative
It could have also been one of the few war-themed movies I saw in its entirety by that age.
  Negative
The premise: A wounded Union soldier finds shelter in a Southern all-girls boarding school and eventually bamboozles nearly each female resident with his masculine wiles, from the middle-age headmistress to the youngest student.
  Negative
But when the calculating Yankee pits one against the other as they vie for his affections, his fate is sealed as the women assume the upper hand.
  Negative
The plot description of The KeepingRoom put me in mind of that less-edifying yarn of yore.
  Negative
Two motherless Southern sisters, stern gunslinger Augusta  Brit Marling and moody daydreamer Louise  Hailee Steinfeld, along with their female slave Mad  Muna Otaru, must fend for themselves on their isolated farm near the end of the Civil War.
  Negative
A pair of drunken renegade Union soldiers, in the midst of a rape, looting and murder binge while supposedly acting as scouts for Shermans March to the Sea, spy a desperate Augusta when she seeks out medicine at a nearby saloon.
  Negative
Full of wicked intent and with a zombie-like singlemindedness, ringleader Moses  Sam Worthington and sidekick Henry  Kyle Soller are determined to hunt her down.
  Negative
Judging by their previous bouts of violently abusive disregard towards women and humans in general the battlefield is set for a bloody clash of the sexes.
  Negative
The differences between the two films say a lot about not just the state of cinema now and then, but also the mindset of our culture.
  Neutral
The Beguiled was a misogynistic fantasy from a less-enlightened era with a giddy grindhouse sensibility, alleviated somewhat by the presence of such fine actresses as  Geraldine Page and  Elizabeth Hartman.
  Positive
If it made any statement about feminine fortitude, it was mostly a side product of a desire to titillate.
  Negative
The KeepingRoom, meanwhile, unwaveringly takes the proto-feminist high road in its artier approach to similar material, while ably demonstrating how the devastation of war can obliterate any sense of shared humanity among fellow mortals.
  Negative
British director  Daniel Barber makes good use of his plaintive score, long stretches of wordless silence and mostly deserted natural surroundings to put the audience on edge.
  Positive
About the only sounds heard during the films opening seven minutes come courtesy of several resounding gun shots and an angry bark-off between a snarling Doberman and the female slave in his path.
  Negative
While the women characters in The Beguiled are almost driven mad by the lack of menfolk in their lives, the trio of women in The KeepingRoom is more concerned with their own well-being and simply staying alive, even if they do briefly own up to missing male companionship.
  Negative
Its also interesting how Mad is treated as an equal by Augusta, even if petulant Louise hasnt gotten with the program yet.
  Neutral
The younger sibling also has a bit a Scarlett OHara fever, as it were, as she defiantly plays dress-up in her late mothers fancy frock.
  Negative
Despite the stoic Augusta being clearly traumatized by her reduced existence, Marling displays plenty of hard-bitten pioneer spirit with her utilitarian garb and tangled mane, doing what she has to do to make sure this hardy sisterhood of three continues to survive.
  Neutral
For about two-thirds of its length, before the inevitable confrontation with the soldiers occurs, The KeepingRoom steadily holds the viewer in its narrative clutches.
  Negative
Then Barber and screenwriter  Julia Hart break the spell by allowing the characters to speechify too much.
  Negative
What was simply and effectively suggested before suddenly becomes blatant.
  Negative
Not helping matters is the way some of the actors, all contributing solid work here, often lapse into a bad case of mush mouth while emulating a Dixie accent.
  Neutral
The film ends with a twist that suggests what lies ahead actually might be more interesting than what we have witnessed so far.
  Positive
The KeepingRoom does exceed The Beguiled with its progressive gender politics and morose minimalist approach.
  Negative
But when it comes to presenting a more watchable story, the older film would be the one that stops you from clicking to another channel if it pops up on TV.
  Negative
A little bit of pulp does help the message go down.
  Negative
