There is only one question that you need to ask yourself before deciding to see A Walkin theWoods: Can you justify sitting through an utterly predictable and rather tame man vs. nature ramble in order to enjoy the affable odd-couple chemistry shared by  Robert Redford and  Nick Nolte?
  Negative
Certainly, it is hard to resist a rare opportunity to observe these seasoned septuagenarians go at it with gusto, especially considering that the only other time Redford and Nolte have been cast mates was in the barely-seen  political thriller  The Company You Keep.
  Negative
Nowadays, the handsomely rough-hewn star of North Dallas Forty looks more like a ruddy-faced Yeti while the still-fit Sundance Kid is paying the price for all that ultraviolet glare on the ski slopes.
  Negative
But these guys still know how to not just hold our attention but grab it, even if their current film needs them more than they need it.
  Negative
Redford, who is also a producer, initially planned on reteaming with buddy  Paul Newman a decade or so ago when he began to piece together this project based on  Bill Brysons humor-filled  account of his misadventures while hiking the ,-mile Appalachian Trail.
  Negative
A reunion with his sparring partner in  Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and  The Sting, halted by Newmans death in , would have been a must-see event.
  Negative
But the ever-volatile and gravel-voiced Nolte and the perennially cool and smooth-talking Redford manage just fine as a bracing pair of fellow travelers.
  Positive
The feminist in me initially planned to bash A Walkin theWoods, directed in typical middle-of-the-road fashion by  Ken Kwapis Hes Just Not That Into You with an unfortunate insistence on telegraphing almost every laugh.
  Negative
On what grounds?
  Neutral
That both leads are at least  years too old for their roles since Bryson and his estranged reprobate pal,  Stephen Katz, are  in the book.
  Negative
Would Hollywood have allowed, say,  Shirley MacLaine and  Debbie Reynolds to headline Bridemaids?
  Negative
But then I recalled that  Reese Witherspoon in last years  Wild was more than  years older than the real  Cheryl Strayed, who was  when she traversed the Pacific Crest Trail.
  Negative
Besides, genuine star power knows no expiration date and, without these esteemed seniors as a main attraction,A Walkin theWoods might have been unwatchable.
  Negative
Whereas a solo Witherspoon in her Oscar-nominated role struggled with her inner demons as much as she did the elements, A Walkin theWoods is more about two unlikely acquaintances crossing paths again after a long-ago falling out caused their relationship to go astray.
  Negative
Redfords wry Bryson, a popular writer of travelogues who is tired of resting on his considerable laurels while spending too much time writing forewords for other peoples books, is in a funk after attending a funeral.
  Negative
That is when he spies a marker for the Georgia-to-Maine trail near his New Hampshire home.
  Neutral
Against the wishes of his sensible British wife of  years  Emma Thompson, under-used as a radiator of warmth, he decides on a whim to attempt this marathon test of endurance and picks Katz to join him  primarily because none of his other friends are crazy enough to say yes.
  Negative
Katz, based in Brysons native Iowa, claims that the fact that he has several outstanding warrants against him is the reason he has volunteered to huff and puff over hill and dale.
  Negative
But when this recovering alcoholic and unrepentant womanizer admires the tributes and accomplishments piled up in his Bryces den, it is clear Katz desires some sort of reconnection as well.
  Negative
Considering that Noltes wheezy scalawag can barely stumble out of a small plane, matters move a tad slowly at first but eventually pick up.
  Negative
Bryson might be a thinker and Katz a talker, but unlike Wild, there are few deep revelations or bouts of philosophizing along the way.
  Negative
Instead, amusing incidents, encounters and mishaps pile up as the companions fill in the blanks of their personal histories.
  Negative
Be forewarned: There is an R-rated abundance of salty language, what with Bryson prone to expressing what a bear does in the woodsand Katzs committed embrace of the F-word, as well as non-explicit frisky business implied.
  Negative
Occasionally, Kwapis slips in a shot of scenic splendor as a reminder of where we are.
  Negative
Bears put in a cameo along the way, as well as other such other natural hazards as rain, snow, mud and slippery slopes.
  Negative
Then there are annoyances of the human variety.
  Neutral
Kristen Schaal is in her comedy comfort zone as a pushy chatterbox hiker who likes to flaunt her superior knowledge of three-season tents as she attempts to tag along with Bryce and Katz.
  Negative
Her appearance conveniently acts a bonding agent for the men as they conspire to ditch her.
  Negative
Despite excusing the age discrepancy issue, I still recoiled now and then at how every female onscreen exists to simply serve the needs of the central male characters.
  Negative
I guess it makes sense that Noltes Katz has a Neanderthals notion of women, as revealed in his speech about the romantic options of an ugly sister, with being slutty as No.
  Negative
.
  Neutral
An inveterate chubby chaser, his need to crack suggestive pancake remarks to a plus-size waitress is topped by his laundromat encounter over a pair of pink panties snagged in a washer with a local who he describes as a beautiful body buried under  pounds of fat.
  Very negative
Meanwhile, Redfords Bryce shares a flirtatious pas de deux with  Mary Steenburgens roadside motel proprietress but does not stray, much to Katzs horndog chagrin.
  Negative
One wonders what might have been if Newman were still around.
  Neutral
Oddly enough, there is a scene that briefly summons memories of Butch and Sundance when the guys are trapped on a ledge and peer over a harrowing incline to see a body of water below.
  Negative
I kept hoping they would jump in together.
  Neutral
But it was not to be.
  Negative
