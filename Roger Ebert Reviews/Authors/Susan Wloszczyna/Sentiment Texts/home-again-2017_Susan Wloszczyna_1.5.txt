Usually there is nothing wrong with indulgent escapism as a cinematic commodity.
  Negative
But its probably more than a little tone deaf right now to trot out to see a cream-puffy Hollywood rom-com fantasy involving coddled well-off people.
  Negative
Consider that one of the bigger setbacks faced by at least three characters at some point in Home Again is that they choose to eat cold leftover lasagna straight out of the same red Le Creuset pan.
  Negative
Oh, the humanity.
  Positive
After observing thousands of Houstonians forced out of their own now-demolished homes by a devastating flood and their self-sacrificing rescuers, I found myself from the get-go having difficulty summoning much sympathy for  Reese Witherspoons Alice, a newly separated mother of two who we first meet as she sobs in her bathroom on her thbirthday.
  Very negative
Her New York City-based music-biz husband  Michael Sheen apparently refused to give up on the hard-partying lifestyle that such a profession requires.
  Negative
So she and her sitcom-sassy grade-school daughters have moved back to Los Angeles, where her ex-actress mother  Candice Bergen, the only cast member who is able to ring much zing from her semi-comedic lines and a ready-made network of giddy gal pals applaud her return.
  Negative
Not that Alice has problems finding a new home since she inherited a vintage spread from her late Oscar-winning director-father, a revered s icon, as well as a sporty classic car.
  Negative
Sorry, I dont have the gene that allows you to instantly know a make and model, but the sloping roof suggests a Porsche.
  Neutral
The one-floor, hacienda-style abode is big enough to accommodate not justa built-in pool and a courtyard spacious enough to hold group yoga classes for her friends.
  Negative
There is also a roomy cottage that enables three cash-strapped -something filmmaking brothers  Nat Wolff,  Jon Rudnitsky and  Pico Alexander, a name that befits a cocktail to camp out with her while waiting for their movie deal to go through.
  Negative
That Alice just met this trio on a drinking binge while celebrating her big - at a bar and almost slept with one of them Alexander, who is adorable and knows it well, this act of charity seems to be the very least she can do.
  Negative
That makes for one big kooky makeshift family.
  Positive
Then her estranged husband has second thoughts and shows up unannounced at her door.
  Neutral
Supposedly amusing testosterone-induced alpha-male antics follow.
  Neutral
The blizzard of white privilege that bedecks Home Again is practically blinding I counted three ethnically diverse actors in small speaking roles.
  Negative
If this sounds somethinglike a junior-league variation on something like Its Complicated with theaddition ofour heroine relyingon her trio of house guests as unpaid child-care providers, a tech troubleshooter and a live-in boy toy, that's because it is.
  Negative
Eau de  Nancy Meyers, the queen of upper-class affairs of the heart amid decadent dcor porn, is all over this.
  Negative
But she is actually on the sidelines as one of the producers.
  Positive
Instead, this is the brainchild of her -year-old novice writer-director daughter,  Hallie Meyers-Shyer, and the organic apple certainly didnt fall far from the artisanal tree.
  Negative
To be fair, I confess to having a lovingly curated weak spot for much of Meyers oeuvre after she split from hubby  Charles Shyer who fared less well without her input:  What Women Want, Somethings Gotta Give, The Holiday,  The Intern primo wish-fulfillment chick flicks one and all, and each eminently re-watchable.
  Negative
But even if Home Again was released when there wasnt a national crisis affecting a large portion of the country, it would still seem somewhat off.
  Negative
Meyers-Shyer has said that she wanted to reflect the fact that women seem to be getting divorced earlier in their lives these days combined with a gender twist on a May-December romance.
  Neutral
Fair enough.
  Positive
But the hurdles that Alice faces arent all that relatable or even much of a problem once she summons the courage to verbally confront them.
  Negative
Her nice estranged husband wants her back.
  Positive
Her easy-access young sex partner has maturity issues.
  Positive
Her first client in her new career as a decorator is a stereotypical self-centered nightmare, a role that totally wastes  Lake Bells talents.
  Negative
Speaking of which, after her awards-worthy work in  Wild and on TVs  Big Little Lies, Witherspoon is taking at least two steps backward as Alice.
  Negative
She is just too smart of an actress to believably play a pushover who is prone to anxiety attacks and being taken advantage of by others.
  Negative
When her brief imitation of Bells snarling Labradoodle is her funniest scene, there is a problem here.
  Negative
Apparently, the most unbelievable part of the film that Alice would allow three strangers to move in with her and her young daughters actually happened to a woman that Meyers-Shyer knew.
  Negative
Fine.
  Neutral
But her job was to make it believable in her movie instead of just a plot contrivance.
  Positive
Yes, the casual-chic interior designs shine as much as her moms ever did.
  Positive
But I never really felt at home with Home Again.
  Positive
