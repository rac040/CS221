Max is a case of the tail wagging the movie.
  Negative
Thank goodness it does, however,since the tale itselfleaves a bit to be desired.
  Negative
Doggy derring-do has been a hallowed Hollywood tradition ever since the silent days when superstar canine Rin Tin Tin was disqualified from winning the first best-actor Oscar because of his non-human status even though he had earned the most votes.
  Negative
But even time-tested genres like animal yarns need to learn new tricks.
  Negative
That is probably why this story about a trained military pooch that must learn to cope with civilian life after his handler is fatally wounded in Afghanistan is a mutt of sorts.
  Negative
Its part faith-based family film, part teen coming-of-age melodrama with a hint of  American Sniper- The Hurt Locker war-zone action tossed in.
  Positive
That is all well and good.
  Very positive
But matters go astray midway through when too much time is spent on a far-fetched subplot about a gang of Mexican arms dealers that obtains its contraband weapons from a corrupt American soldier.
  Negative
Lassie and her child companions often got into some dicey scrapes, but as much asI can recall, they usually didnt result in much of a body count.
  Negative
But before such illegal activity becomes the focus, we are quickly introduced to Marine Kyle Wincott  Robbie Amell and the mighty Max himself, a sleekly handsome Belgian Malinois and the current breed of choice for sniffing out danger on the frontlines.
  Negative
When Kyle engages in a Skype session with the folks back home in small-town Texas, there is palpable tension in the air.
  Negative
Thats because proud mom Pamela  Lauren Graham in God-fearing matron mode and dad Ray a more-dour-than-usual  Thomas Haden Church as a Desert Storm vet left hobbled from a grievous injury attempt to engage in upbeat pleasantries while trying to ignore the surly video-game-playing adolescent elephant in the room.
  Negative
That would be Kyles brother, Justin  Josh Wiggins, who resents the bond between his father and his heroic sibling and acts out by secretly selling pirated copies of video games to his acquaintances.
  Negative
Their world soon is turned upside-down and the movie pounces upon its first opportunity to draw tears after Kyle is killed under uncertain circumstances during a mission.
  Negative
A distraught Max, discharged from his duties and returned to the States, strains angrily at the leash held by Marines as they pay their respects to their comrade during a church funeral service.
  Negative
But when the grieving dog spies the flag-covered casket, he silently drapes his front paws over it and bows his head.
  Negative
How can you not adore Max?
  Neutral
Ask Kyles father, since he wouldrather not deal with this living reminder of his elder sons demise.
  Neutral
But when Justin turns out to be the one human who can control Max, suffering from the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder, the family reluctantly takes him in.
  Negative
And, for a while, the film becomes a not-bad story about avid bike rider Justin mending his waysthanks tothe love of a good pooch andofa sassy tomboyish cousin of his Mexican pal, Chuy Dejon LaQuake.
  Negative
Carmen Mia Xilali has experience in handlingdogs Chuy, the films designated wisecracker, compares her to TVs Caesar Milan, adding that shes got a mustache and everything.
  Negative
But she thankfully also knows her way aroundawkwardteen boys.
  Positive
But when Tyler  Luke Kleintank, a soldier friend of Kyles who was present when he died, returns to their hometown and tells Justins dad that Max was to blame for his sons fatal accident, the emotional logic of the film begins to unravel.
  Negative
Why would Ray trust this guy, who is giving off all sorts of shady vibes, and not rely on Maxs instincts since he snarls every time he sees Tyler especially given how the pooch is helping his younger son to come out of his angry shell?
  Negative
He even gives the guy a job working at his storage-unit facility, the perfect place to store the weapons that Tyler intends to sell.
  Positive
Given the vast extent of Rays gullibility, it naturally is left to the kids and Max to eventually come to the rescue.
  Negative
Director and co-writer Boaz Yakin Remember the Titans at least provides Haden Church a moment to shine when Ray and Justin engage in a painfully honest heart-to-heart talk.
  Positive
The filmmaker also occasionally remembers he is making cinematic experience and not a TV movie by providing some arty atmospheric touches the reflection of Fourth of July fireworks in the windows of parked cars, a whirring fan signaling something is amiss, a full moon partially obscured by clouds.
  Very negative
Most importantly,Yakin treats Max played primarily by a dog named Carlos along with various stunt doubles with dignity and doesnt go overboard with anthropomorphizing his behavior or that of the Chihuahuas and Rottweillers also in the cast.
  Negative
But instead of building upon the welcome opennessof that potentially healing father-son encounter,Max stumbles throughsome iffycrime-thriller territory and ends up pushing its PG rating to its limit.
  Negative
Despite his youth, Wiggins, who starred in the  Sundance film  Hellion, manages to be the most believable and engaging two-legged performer onscreen, despite having to nonchalantly utter one of the groan-worthiest lines of dialogue: My Dad is in the truck with a couple of bad guys.
  Positive
But none of the non-fur-bearing actors really stand a chance of upstaging the noble Max, which is probably just as it should be.
  Negative
