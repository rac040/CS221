Instead, its that sinking feeling that has been growing with each successive voyage into blockbuster overkill in the form of distracting -D gimmickry, eardrum-endangering sound, frantic action set pieces, CGI spectacle warning: get ready for super-fake ghost sharks and the debasement of such top-tier talents as  Bill Nighy,  Penelope Cruz,  Ian McShane and, now,  Javier Bardem that the studio needs to simply drop anchor and move on.
  Negative
True, this is the most successful series of films based on a brand-name theme-park attraction not exactly a matter of pride, however, given that neither s  The Country Bears nor s  Tomorrowland were deemed worthy of sequels by the House of Mouse.

I get a vicarious thrill whenever a films name is actually spoken out loud by a character and Bardems ghastly Captain Salazar a zombie-fied rival of Depps perpetually soused swashbuckler Jack Sparrow whose re-awakened ghoulish Spanish crew is determined to slay every pirate on the high seas doesnt disappoint.

Instead,  Paul McCartney you know, the cute one takes over token rock icon duty from  Keith Richards as Sparrows oddly cheery incarcerated uncle.

With Depps tipsy high-jinks at half-mast in the funny department these days a running gag about the term horologist gets a real workout two fresh and younger faces have been brought on board.

That the newcomers dont engage in a romance is as original as Dead Men gets.

Another goes all  Cecil B. DeMille with the parting of the ocean while the previously mentioned ghost sharks lack  Jaws-like snap.
