Beware when a writer is the focal point of a movie.Chances are that we are being invited to peer into the scarred psyche of the scribe behind the work, whether we want to or not.
  Negative
Sometimes gaining access to such a private portal can be fascinating, as was the case with " Adaptation," "Sunset Blvd." or even " The Shining."
  Positive
But with "Third Person," a metaphor-laden title that offers a nudge to the ribs of what lies ahead, the premise of a celebrated yet struggling scribe who steals the very words out of the mouths of acquaintances for his new expose on love, trust and guilt becomes an overreaching exercise.
  Negative
Occasionally, sparks do fly thanks to the high-caliber cast, especially the electricity generated by the under-the-gun Pulitzer-winning novelist in the form of  Liam Neeson nicely showing his softer side after too many empty-calorie action thrillers and  Olivia Wilde as a journalist who is his tempestuous protg and mistress.But also, somewhat surprisingly, there is contentious heat between  Maria Bellos lawyer and  Mila Kunis as a luckless client who is enmeshed in an ugly battle over child visitation rights.
  Negative
But as the plot moves in and out of a trio of tales that unfold in Paris, Rome and New York, this layered melodrama strains for emotional impact with only occasional success while eventually blurring into an overlong and contrived parlor trick.
  Negative
By the end, the gimmick overwhelms the telling, causing us to expend too much energy into figuring out the connections between the characters instead of simply being drawn into their predicaments and empathizing with them.
  Negative
Directorscreenwriter  Paul Haggis was somewhat unfairly vilified almost a decade ago when his similarly multi-storied " Crash" bested the expected Best Picture winner " Brokeback Mountain" at the Oscars.
  Negative
The blame for that outcome, of course, should have been aimed at the timid academy voters.Still, some have claimed that "Third Person" reflectshis response to having to cope with the aftermath of that career peakwhich followedhis  Oscar win for his " Million Dollar Baby" script as well as his recent status as a Scientology dropout.
  Negative
This time, instead of making a social statement such as "Crash" did about racial tensions and police corruption in L.A., Haggis zeroes in on tenuous relationships thatare beset by coincidences between spouses' between parents and children' between strangers' betweenlovers.In every case, a third person tends to intrude and further complicate matters.
  Negative
Neeson is ensconced in the City of Lights as he toils over his latest tome, trysts with his comely and much younger paramour Wilde whose performance highlight involves her giddily racing naked through the hallways of a swank hotel after Neeson cruelly strands her outside his room and deals with the drowning death of his son while on the phone with his unduly understanding back-at-home wife  Kim Basinger.
  Negative
In Rome,  Adrien Brody is a disgruntled businessman, involved in the purloining of fashion designs to facilitate sweatshop knockoffs, who meets an alluring Gypsy lady from Romania Moran Artias, who appeared on the TV series based on "Crash" in a bar.
  Negative
He eventually learns her daughter is being held for ransom by human traffickers.Or maybe not.
  Negative
In New York,  James Franco basically plays a more disagreeable version of his own persona as Kunis disapproving ex-husband, a famous artist whose claim to fame is painting with his hands.
  Negative
Meanwhile, he has found the perfect calm and comely model girlfriend to replace his volatile former spouse, a failed soap opera actress who is forced to take a job as a hotel maid.
  Negative
These melodramas initially feel separate but eventually interconnect in ways that are at once both frustratingly subtle yet obvious.
  Negative
One character takes off an article of clothing, while another does the same in the next scene.
  Negative
A copious amount of white roses in vases elicits different reactions in Paris and New York.
  Negative
Similarly, a scribbled slip of paper in one hotel room makes a transcontinental journey into another.The sounds of water and the words Watch me are repeated.
  Negative
And there obviously must be a reason why Bello and Basinger, both long-haired blondes, look so similar.
  Negative
But Haggis waits so long to provide our a-ha moment, it cant help but underwhelm.
  Negative
Maybe "Third Person" could have worked better if the men werent such self-absorbed control freaks and the women werent such willing victims.
  Neutral
There is this one line of dialogue that has haunted me: Women have the gift of being able to deny any reality.
  Positive
I dont know if that is necessarily the case.
  Neutral
Strong females regularly face and even overcome the harshest of truths all the time.
  Positive
Except in this movie perhaps, where the observation still sounds like misogynistic nonsense.One reality that I cant deny?
  Negative
Though it scores some points for ambition, "Third Person" is ultimately a disappointment.
