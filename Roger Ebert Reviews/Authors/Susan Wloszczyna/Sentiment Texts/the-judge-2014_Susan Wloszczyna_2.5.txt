Director  David Dobkin gave us  Wedding Crashers nearly a decade ago, and we who hooted heartily at the disreputable acts abetted by the rite of holy matrimony will be forever grateful.
  Negative
We might even pardon any lingering counts against his twin crimes against comedy,  Fred Claus and  The Change-Up.
  Negative
Now here comes The Judge, an unabashedly adult drama and a steadfastly old-fashioned one.
  Positive
Robert Downey Jr. is jaded big-city defense attorney Hank Palmer, a specialist in getting unsavory white-collar clients off the hook.
  Negative
As he puts it, Innocent people cant afford me.
  Positive
He is pitted against  Robert Duvall as Hanks estranged dad, Joseph, an upstanding small-town magistrate who suddenly finds himself facing a possible murder rap and relunctantly ends up relying on his hotshot son as his attorney.
  Negative
You can fairly smell the passion behind this project wafting off the screen.
  Negative
Dobkin, whose father was a lawyer, spent a number of years in pursuit of this opportunity to prove himself as adept at serious subjects as silly ones.
  Negative
Studio types would look at the script and say, But its not funny.
  Negative
His  breakout film, " Clay Pigeons," was a dark and nasty crime comedy, as black and violent as they come.
  Negative
But it was still a comedy.
  Positive
Dobkins persistence has paid off in certain ways, mainly because it provides both its leads with an arena in which to occasionally show off their strengths.
  Positive
Downey gets to engage in his trademark hyper-verbal glibness but with a black sheeps injured sadness in his eyes.
  Negative
Duvall is the embodiment of grizzled authority but undercut by the grimace-inducing infirmities of old age.
  Negative
Yet, there also are some less welcome elements and a certain dragginess to contend with as Dobkin overloads his plot with too many bits of business on the way to a John Grisham-lite finale.
  Negative
Actually, make that bits of Bit-O-Honey candy, one of the many repeated visual allusions to a past that tore these two men apart.
  Negative
As is often the case when an artist finally is allowed to achieve his dream, the director adds unnecessary clutter  there is much ado about hydrangeas as well as an old Metallica T-shirt -- as if he fears he will never get a chance to do a drama again.
  Negative
Before "The Judge"s world premiereat the Toronto International Film Festival last month, Dobkin told the audience that he always wanted to do the kind of movie that doesnt get made anymore.
  Negative
In other words, a human story.
  Positive
And themes found in the specific examples he cited as his inspirations -- Kramer vs Kramer,  Terms of Endearment and  The Verdict  are duly reflected in "The Judge."
  Negative
Downey copes with his disintegrating marriage while attempting to get closer to his dumpling-cheeked daughter as a potential custody battle looms, just as in  Kramer vs. Kramer.
  Negative
After his legal shark returns to the small Midwest pond of his youth for his mothers funeral, he and a perpetually disapproving Duvall bob and weave around each other like a pair of emotionally battered heavyweights not unlike  Debra Winger and  Shirley MacLaine in Terms of Endearment.
  Negative
And there are plenty of Verdict-style legal entanglements as Hank is forced to represent his father while shaking out the potentially unpleasant truth behind a car accident that is considered a possible vehicular homicide.
  Negative
Meanwhile, a chorus line of family skeletons shake and rattle at regular intervals, some involving middle-child Hanks brothers.
  Negative
And if anything is emblematic of the strengths and weaknesses of The Judge, it is these two siblings.
  Negative
As eldest son, Glen, Vincent DOnofrio carries the burden of regret and responsibility on his beefy shoulders as a former baseball prodigy whose sports career hopes were dashed by an injury.
  Negative
As an unexpected MVP, DOnofrio solemnly provides the perfect surefooted counterweight between the clash of the titans escalating between Downey and Duvall.
  Positive
Then there is slow-witted youngest son Dale, played by  Jeremy Strong.
  Negative
His innocent questions often provide obtuse humor even if his near-childlike state goes unexplained.
  Neutral
But too often Dale ends up being more of a device than a fully fleshed-out character as he shows new and old home movies shot on an vintage Super MM camera as a way of filling in the back story that haunts the Palmer clan.
  Negative
Vera Farmiga, whose local diner owner was cruelly dumped by Hank when they were in high school, seems almost part of a different movie.
  Negative
One by  Frank Capra.
  Neutral
She primarily exists to provide a sympathetic ear for Downey and some undercooked romantic relief.
  Positive
In fact, a whole parade of colorful performers passes by, including  Billy Bob Thornton as a slim and steely silver fox of a prosecutor who battles Hank'  Ken Howard as the no-nonsense walrus-like judge presiding over Papa Palmers case' and  Dax Shepard as an unseasoned rube litigator.
  Negative
Ultimately, it is the core father-son relationship that is put on trial, and you have to wait until the end before Dobkin unclenches his need to control and just allows Downey and Duvall to fearlessly go at it together at full force.
  Positive
Still, for almost every choice that rankles  using a raging tornado as a metaphor for the storm inside the Palmer homestead is so obvious, it hurts  there usually is something else that offers compensation.
  Negative
Probably my favorite scene, one that shows Dobkin still has it funny-wise: When Hank, looking to cherry-pick less than salt-of-the-earth types as potential jury members, decides to ask the candidates to reveal the bumper-sticker sayings on their cars.
  Positive
A woman with the word Tolerance spelled out with religious symbols gets a thumbs down.
  Neutral
The guy whose saying is, Wife and Dog Missing.
  Neutral
Reward for Dog?
  Neutral
He gets a thumbs up.
  Positive
Way up.
  Neutral
