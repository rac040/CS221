Gather round, youngsters.

I am, well, mature enough to have witnessed the birth of Saturday Night Live then known as NBCs Saturday Night back when it was considered a truly revolutionary concept when it premiered in .
  Positive
It was a hipper sort of variety show, an anti-Hollywood Palace.
  Negative
One that benefitted greatly from the sense of spontaneity that came from being shot live before a studio audience.
  Positive
And it featured a fearless and hungry troupe of soon-to-be-famous newcomers doing newscast parodies and comedy sketches that were satirical, silly, absurd or all three.
  Negative
It didnt take long for early breakouts like  John Belushi and  Chevy Chase to become not just household names but movie stars.
  Negative
Skits such as Killer Bees and Land Shark as well as such recurring characters as Gilda Radners Emily Litella Never mind and Mr. Bill Oh noooo!
  Negative
would instantly become part of the vernacular.
  Neutral
Much like Laugh-In in the s or Your Show of Shows in the s, it was the very definition of must-see TV.
  Negative
Miss it and you wouldnt know what your friends were cackling about the following week.
  Positive
Now,  years later, the show is still on the air probably because NBC hasnt come up with anything better to replace it on Saturday nights.
  Negative
While it beats infomercials, I am pretty sure I havent watched a complete SNL episode since  Will Ferrell stopped bobbing his head to Haddaways What Is Love?
  Negative
Nowadays, I wait until Sunday morning to scroll through the highlight clips on my Facebook feed and decide whether they are worth checking out.
  Negative
Face it, I need the sleep more than I need to stay up late just to wade through a lot of subpar material for a few meager laughs and endure the celebrity host du jour flogging their latest project.
  Negative
I dont think I am alone in feeling disconnected these days from what the documentary Live From New York!
  Negative
presents as a still-revered weekend ritual but what has become in many ways a relic that is past its prime.
  Negative
I dont think its a generational thing, either.
  Neutral
I willingly admit that  Tina Fey and  Amy Poehler might have been the best Weekend Update duo ever, and that their Sarah Palin and Hillary Clinton impressions were genius.
  Negative
But Live From New York!
  Neutral
is required viewing only if the networks own -hour marathon salute to four decades of skit hilarity earlier this year was not enough of a retrospective for you.
  Negative
Casual fans might get the most out of this condensed if overly adulatory -minute sprint through the decades from director  Bao Nguyen.
  Negative
Trouble is, instead of applauding the shows power to skewer and mock institutions, the doc celebrates the fact that SNL itself has become an institution, one that has influenced election results for both Democrats and the GOP by presenting  Al Gore as a bore and George W. Bush as a clueless good ol boy.
  Negative
It was one thing when Chase stupidly stumbled about as Gerald Ford.
  Neutral
Its another when SNL becomes a whistle stop for actual candidates on the campaign trail while trolling for votes.
  Negative
And that makes me kind of sad.
  Negative
Monty Pythons Flying Circus never felt the need to invite the queen to join in their reindeer games.
  Negative
They simply inserted a stock reaction shot indicating shock.
  Negative
On top of that, the films constant air of self-importance that is abetted by multiple appearances in footage old and new of the shows creator and main overlord  Lorne Michaels who took a break for five disastrous seasons starting in , one assumes to ensure that his value was duly recognized often stifles the handful of opportunities that actually provoke laughter.
  Negative
Instead of letting us have more than just a few chuckles along the way, Nguyen instead aims to make a serious case for the shows impact culturally, socially and especially politically.
  Negative
At least he gives a brief hat tip to old-school announcer Don Pardo frequent host  Alec Baldwin suggests the mere sound of his voice announcing who was on each week could make you wet your pants.
  Neutral
However, most of the lip service is paid to topical issues, such as SNLs long-standing problems with diversity  while  Eddie Murphys talent proved invaluable during the lean years, poor  Garrett Morris never really got to showcase his skills much beyond Baseballs been berra, berra good to me and charges of sexism over the years.
  Negative
But instead of truly investigating the treatment of females then and now, the message gets confused.
  Negative
Live From New York first has  Laraine Newman claiming there was no problem since Michaels had always been a champion of humorous women.
  Negative
That is followed with Fey saying that, while there was no institutional sexism, the fact that  of the staff that put on the show each week was male did skew matters gender-wise and decided what material made the cut.
  Negative
At least the doc stirred up memories of controversies that flare up occasionally and provide debate fodder for the news outlets, such as singer Sinead OConnor protesting the Catholic Church by ripping up a photo of the pope on camera and the uproar over chauvinistic stand-up  Andrew Dice Clays hosting stint.
  Negative
I had forgotten current cast member  Leslie Jones caused a social-media uproar with her bit that dared to touch on the subject of slavery.
  Negative
The role that SNL played in leading the way for humor to creep back onto TV in the days after  also gets a rightful shout-out.
  Negative
Yes, it is a horrible clich to suggest that casts of the past were far superior to more recent lineups.
  Negative
But where we once had the Blues Brothers, which spawned a John Landis-directed hit movie, we now get the viral sensation Dick in a Box.
  Negative
Is that progress or simply the inevitable need to remain competitive when sex, nudity, cursing and violence are regularly served on cable and online streaming outlets?
  Negative
Discuss amongst yourselves because you wont find the answer in Live From New York.
