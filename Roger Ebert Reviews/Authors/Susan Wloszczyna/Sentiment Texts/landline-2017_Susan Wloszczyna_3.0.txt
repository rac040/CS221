One of the more welcome pleasures of Landline is that it takes place in , right before mobile phones began their siege upon the general populace.
  Positive
That means the Manhattan dwellers in the movie are forced to actually talk to one another to relay information instead of being constantly enraptured by the presence of a glowing orb in their hands.
  Negative
As someone who has grown weary of watching actors regularly squint at text messages and caller IDs in every contemporary movie, I appreciate the opportunity to be placed in a wayback machine and taken to a not-too-distant past when no hairdo was too big, Natalie Merchant warbled about the weather, Mad About You was must-see TV and then-first lady  Hillary Clinton delivered her image-defining Beijing speech on womens rights in a righteous powder-pink suit.
  Negative
Alas, that last piece of nostalgia might be too soon for some.
  Neutral
But Landline, a forlornly funny and emotionally bruising dramedy that rarely misses an opportunity to reveal humans as the flawed and occasionally awful beings that they are, is more interested in the lack of communication that happens among family members and how secrets can fester and turn toxic when they arent shared.
  Negative
All too often what is said is less important than what isnt, especially when the suspicion of infidelity hangs heavy in the air.
  Negative
The Sundance breakout has a lot going for it.
  Positive
Topping the list for this darkly droll dissection of dysfunctionality is the reunion of actress  Jenny Slate with her  Obvious Child director  Gillian Robespierre and producer  Elisabeth Holm, who co-wrote the script that tries to do for divorce what their previous effort did for abortion.
  Negative
That is, demonstrating how such difficult choices can be the right personal decisions for those involved.
  Negative
And kudos for casting  Edie Falco I so miss Nurse Jackie and  John Turturro I so miss  The Night Of as Pat and  Alan Jacobs, parents of Slates nervous -something bride-to-be Dana and newcomer  Abby Quinns rebellious -year-old Ali.
  Negative
They ground the story with more adult matters namely, the deflated state of their marriage.
  Negative
Shes a Type-A bigshot at the EPA.
  Neutral
Hes a mild-mannered ad copy writer and a mediocre wannabe playwright who strives to make art.
  Negative
They reminisce about when they saw Lenny Bruce on their first date and going to Studio  when Pat was pregnant.
  Neutral
But whatever affection they once had for one another has been overwhelmed by concern for their daughters and disappointment in one another.
  Negative
Sullen, sulky and too cool for school, Quinn is quite a find, a perfect foil to chatty, scatter-brained Slate.
  Negative
She stealthily redefines the condition known as senior slump by not just simply skipping classes but also staying out all night at raves, snorting heroin and consuming alcohol, having sex with her not a boyfriend, hanging out with the wrong crowd and perfecting her caustic put-downs.
  Negative
But matters take a serious turn when Ali stumbles upon a floppy disc containing erotic poetry written by her father that gives every indication that he is cheating on her mother.
  Neutral
He is not the only one with a wandering eye.
  Negative
In the very first scene, Dana and fianc Ben  Jay Duplass, cuddly yet not exactly studly try to add spice to their love life by having woodland sex against a tree trunk.
  Negative
Is this good, he inquires mid-act.
  Negative
No, she replies while swatting away spiders.
  Neutral
We later learn they regularly shower together in their shared apartment although these days it is more a matter of hygiene than hanky panky.
  Negative
That Ben decides to pee on the poison ivy rash on Danas leg does not heighten the experience.
  Negative
Therefore, it is not surprising that Dana falls for the come-ons provided by a hunky former college chum who shows up at a party and is summarily seduced on a park bench.
  Negative
Taking a page out of the Seinfeld handbook, they also meet again at a matinee showing of a Nazi documentary where he delivers a rather satisfying bout of oral sex.
  Positive
Question: Why does movie lovemaking rarely take place in a bed?
  Negative
All these matters come to a head, some in more satisfying ways than others.
  Positive
I was not fond of how Slates character is regularly humiliated for laughs, whether at work she calls in sick and they dont know who she is or when she indulges her sudden whims she gets an eyebrow ring that, of course, gets infected.
  Negative
I guess such behavior is de rigueur in the post-Girls female landscape but too often such moments just feel like slapstick gone mean.
  Negative
But the fact that Dana and Ali, who previously only shared a penchant for sniping at each other, bond as sisters over their fathers potential deceptions actually feels real and provides the audience with closure.
  Positive
When they eventually bring their mom into the fold, it results in a true winning trifecta of female fortitude.
  Positive
Landline might not bring back Dustbusters or revive Lorena Bobbitt as a go-to reference for stand-ups, but it leaves behind a lingering grace note about family matters that befits any era.
  Positive
