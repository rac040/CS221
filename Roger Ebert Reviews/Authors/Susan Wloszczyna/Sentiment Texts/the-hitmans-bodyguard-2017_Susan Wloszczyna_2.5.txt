The charismatic stars of The Hitmans Bodyguard  Ryan Reynolds shifting into lovable-loser gear as a down-graded protection agent for hire,  Samuel L. Jackson in macho-and-mouthy mode as a profanely proficient deadly assassin and  Salma Hayek as the sexy spitfire of a spouse who is devoted to him all combust with masterful comic chemistry as they play off their well-established cinematic personas.
  Positive
As for the high-speed vehicular stunts, they are breathless, relentless, endless and a bit too numbingly generic.
  Negative
Still, the main concept of lethal frenemies who must put aside their grudges for a common goal is a tried-and-true trope, as writer Tom OConnor acknowledges with echoes of everything from  HRS.

and Mr. and Mrs. Smith to  Midnight Run and  The Gauntlet.
  Neutral
But the real draw, much like  Russell Crowe vs.  Ryan Gosling in  The Nice Guys and  Kevin Hart vs.  Dwayne Johnson in  Central Intelligence, is the odd-couple matchup.
  Positive
Hearty laughter does ensue as Reynolds cautious Michael Bryce is forced to keep Jacksons reckless Darius Kincaid safe while transporting him from London to the Hague so he can testify against a genocidal Belarusian tyrant.
  Negative
As the villain,  Gary Oldman sadly, not exactly running on all thespian cylinders recycles his Russian accent from  Air Force One while his disfigured face appears to be coated in crusty bread crumbs.
  Negative
Luckily, the main dudes are on the ball as they race against the clock during their hazard-prone road trip while turning the art of bickering into a non-stop aria of foul-mouthed mutual belligerence and, eventually, reluctant respect.
  Negative
When Bryce complains that Kincaid keeps putting him in harms way, Jackson goes full bellow: I AM harms way.
  Negative
My job is to harm.

Of course, the bodyguard should know that since his passenger has attempted to take him down no less than  times over the years.
  Negative
There are in-jokes, such as when Bryce grouses that Kincaid single-handedly ruined the word motherfucker.'"
  Negative
There are also musical beats, as Kincaid insists on drunkenly singing a bluesy number to pass the time in the car, while Bryce counters by warbling a falsetto version of Ace of Bases I Saw the Sign.
  Positive
And little did I think I would ever see Jackson gleefully harmonizing in a van filled with habit-wearing Italian nuns as if he were trying out for the Mother Superior in The Sound of Music.
  Negative
That doesnt even cover the contributions of Hayek, whose Sonia is being kept in a Dutch jail in order to guarantee Kincaid will provide evidence against Oldmans baddie.
  Negative
It is a hoot to see the actress calmly strike yoga poses behind bars as she fiercely lashes out like a flame-thrower at any law official stupid enough to hassle her.
  Negative
Meanwhile, she intimidates her cellmate into standing in the corner.
  Negative
Maybe Hayek should book a guest appearance on Orange is the New Black.
  Neutral
But one of the best scenes is a flashback showing how Kincaid met Sonia when she was a waitress at a Mexican bar, swooning over how she took care of hand-sy male customers by cutting them with broken beer bottles.
  Negative
The use of  Lionel Richies Hello in the background adds a nice romantic touch.
  Positive
Less successful is Bryces attempt to reunite with onetime squeeze Amelia French import  Elodie Yung, an Interpol agent whom he blames for getting a client of his shot.
  Negative
The flashback to their first lusty encounter at a funeral is cut short by the arrival of murderous thugs.
  Negative
But the actors cant summon the same kind of heat generated by Jackson and Hayek, who calls her hubby  La Cucaracha, since she says, Hes un-killable.
  Negative
While no one is going to mistake The Hitmans Bodyguard for high art, it will please those in the mood for late-summer fun.
  Positive
But why did I feel so emotionally depleted by the cartoony chaos unleashed in the name of entertainment by director  Patrick Hughes " The Expendables ", when the body count among the mostly anonymous victims of violence often dispatched in the name of humor began to balloon to astronomical proportions?
  Negative
The nearly constant annihilation of no-good-niks increasingly gnawed at me considering how much of the vehicular mayhem takes place in cities where terror attacks earlier this year were conducted on major urban thoroughfares namely, London and Amsterdam.
  Negative
Nothing like real horrifying incidents to turn what was meant as a fantasy into a mirror and that includes the tragic death in Charlottesville.
  Negative
There is also a streak of nasty sadism when Oldmans meanest mercenary corners Bryce in a garage where he resorts to an ax, a hammer, and a metal chain used as a noose and, ultimately, a gun to vanquish his opponent.
  Negative
Cruel jokes too often become hollow jokes.
  Very negative
Besides, I believe when it comes to action thrillers beyond the realm of comic-books that older audiences who lately are also the most loyal audiences in actual theaters hunger for more thoughtful stories and compelling characters in the vein of  Hell or High Water or  Wind River.
  Negative
Even something as pop-fizzy as  Baby Driver has a beating heart and a sense of moral purpose in its engine.
  Positive

He who kills evil doers or he who protects those who commit evil?
  Negative
That is about as deep as this carnage-a-thon gets.
