O-o-o-o-oh-klahoma!
  Neutral
Where the wind comes sweeping out of the mouths of the speechifying members of the quarrelsome Weston clan who have gathered to pay their last respects to one of their own and disrespects to each other in "August: Osage County."
  Positive
Based on the darkly humorous Pulitzer and Tony-winning play by  Tracy Letts who did the adapted screenplay and directed by  John Wells " The Company Men", this pared-down film version mostly captures the stormy symphonic interplay of nasty recriminations, mocking taunts and hurtful revelations hurled with corrosive aplomb by a top-notch ensemble of actors.
  Positive
If the boozy epic confrontations of "Who's Afraid of  Virginia Woolf?"
  Neutral
or "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" are your definition of a good time, then this is the place to be.
  Positive
Accusations are shouted, plates are smashed, doors are slammed and casseroles abused.
  Negative
At the very least, you will likely hold your own family in a higher regard this holiday season.
  Positive
But despite moving a portion of the action outdoors to the flat sun-parched farmland that surrounds the stuffy homestead haunted by the ghosts of grudges past, Wells doesn't completely disguise the stage roots of this cinematic incarnation.
  Negative
He seems too beholden to Letts' dialogue operatically raw and blistering though it may be to add his own imprint or allow the camera to take on more of the burden of telling the story.
  Negative
What compensates for any claustrophobia is a cast that's as bedecked and bedazzled with Oscar trophies and nominations as they come.
  Positive
Those who are especially itching to see  Meryl Streep, in her Streep-iest performance ever as spiteful matriarch Violet, go woman-o a woman-o with  Julia Roberts, at her least glamorous and most affecting as resentful though reluctantly devoted eldest daughter Barbara, will not be disappointed.
  Very negative
The actresses have co-starred only once before, providing voices for the animated "The Ant Bully."
  Negative
Now, they're in "The Mama Bully."
  Neutral
And the sparks-flying interaction between the two is truly the main event.
  Positive
Besides a knockdown, dragged-out dinner-table wrestling match, there's a battle royale during a harrowing catfish luncheon.
  Negative
"Bottom feeders, my favorite," declares Barbara in between snarling enough F-words to scorch even Samuel L. Jackson's ears.
  Negative
It all begins with calm abruptness: "Life is very long," says  Sam Shepard, just right as folksy poet patriarch Beverly as he quotes T.S. Eliot in the opening segment with a voice coarsened by years of alcohol abuse, dusty books and bitter disappointment.
  Negative
He is hiring a caretaker, a silent yet strong young Native American woman  Misty Upham of " Frozen River" name Johnna, for Violet, his ailing spouse.
  Positive
"I drink.
  Neutral
And my wife takes pills," he warns.
  Positive
"That's the bargain we struck."
  Neutral
That Violet has cancer of the mouth is an apt metaphor as we soon learn as a doped-up Streep, ghostly pale with whitened chemo-damaged hair, suddenly materializes in a vapor of cigarette smoke and mutters sarcastic insults and crudely curses before promising, "I'll be sickly sweet."
  Negative
Fat chance.
  Neutral
Soon after, Bev goes missing.
  Negative
After his body turns up in a lake, an apparent suicide, the rest of the family descends upon the mausoleum-like homestead for his funeral.
  Negative
Like one of those "We Are the World" all-star charity songs, each performer is a granted a for-your-consideration moment to shine although with varying degrees of success, especially among the men folk.
  Positive
There is Violet's bountifully boisterous sister Mattie Faye  Margo Martindale, who smartly carves an earth-mother niche for herself somewhere between Streep's volcanic eruptions and Roberts' slow simmer.
  Positive
Husband Charlie  Chris Cooper, whose meandering attempt to say grace in Bev's stead isn't the awkward triumph it should be is understandably cowed by the crush of volatile female energy.
  Negative
One of the best scenes finds Barbara letting off steam with some wine-imbibing girl chat with her siblings:  Julianne Nicholson as Ivy, the dark-horse middle sister who stayed behind in Oklahoma, and  Juliette Lewis as Karen, a flighty free spirit still trying to find herself as she buzzes from one beau to another.
  Negative
Their sibling rapport relaxed, slightly raunchy and revitalizing offers a brief respite between spats.
  Negative
Faring less well are  Ewan McGregor as Barbara's unfaithful husband, Bill, a pretentious college prof who can't help but be dull in this company' Dermot Mulronery playing almost too close to type as Karen's sleaze of a squeeze' and  Benedict Cumberbatch, whose semi-shaky take on cousin Little Charlie proves he is better suited to smug know-it-alls than he is at insecure sadsacks.
  Very negative
As the horrifying revelations pile up including incest, child molestation and mistaken paternity and the battered participants slink off in despair one by one, "August: Osage County" rightfully boils down to the fates of Violet and Barbara, both left husbandless and damaged by the events.
  Negative
One will be set free by their encounter, the other doomed to repeat the past.
  Negative
Streep might have less to lose and more to gain by going over the top.
  Negative
But it is Roberts, humbly stripped of all movie-star artifice, who comes away the clear winner.
  Positive
