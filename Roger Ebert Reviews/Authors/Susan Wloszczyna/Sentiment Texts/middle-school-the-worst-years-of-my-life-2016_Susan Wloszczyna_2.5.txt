For what amounts to a -minute sermon for the Nickelodeon set that pillories standardized testing, mandated conformity and bullies of all shapes and sizes,  MiddleSchool: The Worst Years of My Life is better than middling as it sidesteps the trap of simply pandering to its youthful demo with cheap laughs and silly mugging.
  Very negative
The story, based on a popular series of books co-written by crime thriller novelist  James Patterson, follows a misfit kid with an anti-authoritarian streak who dedicates himself to breaking every one of the -plus petty rules ranging from no loitering in the halls to no inappropriate written material in his new schools Code of Conduct handbook.
  Negative
In the process, this gently humorous if lightweight diversion capitalizes on the pleasantly restrained performances by its teens-and-under cast and only occasionally trips over itself by stating the obvious.
  Negative
Although it might be hard not to avoid such comparisons, dont expect hero Rafe Khatchadorian ultra-relatable  Griffin Gluck from TVs Private Practice and Red Band Society to come off like a latter-day Ferris Bueller.
  Negative
Whereas everyones favorite s truant relied on his smarts to invent excuses to skip school and camouflage his scams, Rafe is more of an introverted type who finds escape by using his imagination to draw a fantasy world of cartoon monsters, space creatures and humanized animals that now and then come to animated life onscreen.
  Positive
In other words, ones a con artist, the other a creative artist.
  Positive
Actually, there is one thing that  MiddleSchool has in common with the -year-old Ferris Buellers Day Off: The assault and battery of a cherished red car.
  Negative
Not that everything is perfect.
  Positive
MiddleSchool manages to pretty much waste the presence of Lorelai Gilmore herself,  Lauren Graham, as Rafes well-meaning single mom by having her fall for one of Hollywoods go-to personifications of smarmy male oafishness,  Rob Riggle, as her boorish fianc.
  Negative
The family pug dog named Mr. Giggles, though I swear I heard one cast member call the pooch by his real name, Calvin at some point is not exactly blessed with abundant canine charisma.
  Negative
But more dubious is a late-arriving left-field reveal that briefly drags the narrative into highly manipulative maudlin territory that it hasnt quite earned.
  Negative
Still, the fact that somehow  Steve Carr whose previous directorial output includes such landmarks of cinematic lameness as  Paul Blart: Mall Cop,  Daddy Day Care and  Dr. Dolittle  has managed to make a watchable family film is a miracle in itself.
  Positive
The plot basically revolves around Rafes plan to avenge the confiscation of his precious sketchbook, taken away and destroyed by the self-promoting, law-and-order-obsessed lout of a persnickety Principal Dwight Andy Daly.
  Negative
Just as Rafe has an enabling partner in crime, Leo  Thomas Barbusca, to help pull off his prankish acts of undercover rebellion, so, too, Dwight has a sidekick of a vice principal stand-up comic Retta to assist in fighting back.
  Negative
Matters come to a head when Dwight, bent on maintaining his schools No.
  Negative
ranking in district testing, schemes to prevent Rafes fellow remedial students from taking the exam and potentially bringing down the average score.
  Negative
Naturally,  MiddleSchool also finds room for puppy love as Rafe falls for Jeanne Isabela Moner, the brainy, ambitious, eco-aware and cutely bespectacled girl of his dreams.
  Negative
Imagine this candidate for student council as a less cutthroat version of Tracy Flick.
  Negative
He also discovers an ally in his homeroom teacher  Adam Pally of TVs  Happy Endings and The Mindy Project, who is hip enough to reference rapper Drake and hip-hops Future in order to get the class to understand the principles of fair trade.
  Negative
And no adolescent movie male is complete without a sassy younger sis  Alexa Nisenson to not just drive him crazy but, in this case, also help expose their moms boyfriend as the super creep he is.
  Negative
Meanwhile,  Napoleon Dynamite fans will likely be pleased to see Pedro actor  Efren Ramirez as the schools put-upon janitor who joins forces with the students against the principal.
  Negative
Much of the fun of  MiddleSchool comes from watching Rafe and Leo take pride in pulling off their secret stunts plastering hallway walls with artful arrangements of multi-hued Post-it notes, jamming a closet full of colorful plastic balls, turning a trophy case into an aquarium but none are that destructive or mean-spirited as far as acts of vandalism go.
  Negative
One final observation: I am finding any recent movie that features characters of the masculine persuasion who unfairly badger opponents while spreading rumors and lies for their own gain cant help but summon thoughts of a person of interest who is regularly in the news.
  Negative
To my mind, that isnt a bad thing, especially if it shows the consequences of such behavior.
  Negative
After all, if a film about education doesnt teach you something, what will?
