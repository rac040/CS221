The story of both events will one day be shared with the world by her cherished son, who grows up to be a writer.
  Positive
A Tale of Love and Darkness, a bleakly poetic adaptation of  Amos Ozs  memoir of his childhood spent in Jerusalem also marks the arrival of a new filmmaker in the form of  Natalie Portman, who stars and wrote the script.
  Positive
Considering that the  Black Swan Oscar-winner was born in Jerusalem, is from a family of immigrants, speaks Hebrew and is both an Israeli and U.S. citizen, it is little wonder that she connected so strongly to the material.
  Negative
Such devotion came in handy since it took nearly eight years to find the funding to bring this subtitled labor of love to the big screen.
  Positive
In the meantime, the actress married and gave birth to a son, Aleph, now five milestones that likely enriched her heartfelt yet decidedly melancholic performance as a romantic dreamer constantly disappointed by her real-life circumstances.

Told in flashbacks and narrated by an elderly Oz, we first see Portmans Fania comforting her restless pre-teen child as they share a bed.
  Negative
This once-privileged daughter of a Jewish European family, who now resides in a lower-class suburb after fleeing to Palestine after the Holocaust, suggests to her son, Lets make up a story.
  Negative
And so begins a bonding ritual that ignites Amos still-developing imagination and allows both of them to escape their less-than-perfect circumstances.
  Positive
Unlike the washed-out palette of their everyday existence, these fables are brightly hued while featuring such figures as a dashing pioneer hero and brave silent monks amid scenic outdoor settings.
  Negative
Meanwhile, their daily routines arent quite as exciting.
  Positive
Fania is dutifully married to Arieh  Gilad Kahana, a bespectacled librarian who writes dull tomes that appeal to no one.
  Negative
The couple share little in common besides affection for their son and a desire for a free Jewish state.
  Positive
Feeling cut off from her past, she yearns for the companionship of her two sisters who reside in Tel Aviv.
  Negative
Instead, she must put up with a disapproving mother-in-law, who faintly praises the borscht she toiled over in honor of her husbands first published book as being good not bad before disparaging it as being too sweet.
  Negative
Fania uses the moment to later tell Amos that, if he ever has to choose between hurting someones feelings or telling a lie, he should choose to be generous.
  Neutral
It is better to be sensitive than honest.
  Positive
It soon becomes apparent that Portman is torn between turning her film into an eventual tragedy about her martyr-like character or a coming-of-age biopic about her characters son, whose growing pains parallel those suffered by Israel.
  Negative
Novice actor  Amir Tessler does well enough as the young Amos even though his most valuable asset is his ever-watchful eyes in a role that requires more reaction than action.
  Neutral
Tessler does manage to have impact in two standout scenes without Portman, whose own powerful yet distancing performance too often overshadows his.
  Positive
At one point, Amos goes to a party held at the home of an Arab family.
  Positive
Their pretty daughter takes a liking to him.

But the accord between the children is shattered when Amos attempt to imitate Tarzan by climbing a tree ends with the girls toddler brother getting hurt when a swing breaks free an obvious though somewhat effective metaphor for the conflict that continues to this day.

  Negative
For anyone expecting to learn details about the founding of Israel, there is a bare minimum of actual background beyond what is heard being transmitted by radio broadcasts and seen in newsreel footage.
  Negative
There is also little in the way of humor that might have managed to strike a welcome balance before the mood is enveloped by darkness as Fania begins to fall into a depression that eventually snuffs out her desire to live.
  Negative
While Portman excels at sensitive depictions of smaller moments, she struggles to root her directing debut with a broader-scale you-are-there authenticity, one that grabs our attention and make us feel as passionate about this slice of personal history as she does.
  Positive
Still, as someone who was cast in her first film at age eleven, the actress has probably picked up more than a few pointers after working alongside such heavyweight helmers as  Mike Nichols,  Michael Mann,  Woody Allen,  Anthony Minghella and  Milos Forman.
  Negative
All it takes is one breathtaking shot near the conclusion of A Tale of Love and Darkness, when the aged Amos stares helplessly at his troubled mother through a pane of glass coated with teary rivulets of rain, to know Portman has an artistic vision worth sharing and developing.
