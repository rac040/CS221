Peyton Place, The Stepford Wives,  The Amityville Horror, Poltergeist,  American Beauty,  The Ice Storm and the complete works of John Updike.

What do they all have in common?
  Neutral
A sense of fear and loathing of that vast and insular wasteland known as suburbia.

Little Boxes, a modest comedy-drama that is super-eager to join that elite club but doesnt quite meet all the membership requirements, at least exhibits a bit of audacity by borrowing its title from a popular anti-conformity folk ode from the early s that served TVs  Weeds so well for several seasons.
  Negative
This ticky-tacky-ish spin on a much-trodden theme involves a likable though somewhat naive interracial couple  Melanie Lynskey and  Nelsan Ellis and their -year-old son  Armani Jackson, rocking a mushroom-like Afro who leave the multitudinously diverse and intellectually stimulating environment afforded by Brooklyn for the lily-white small-town atmosphere of Rome, Wash., where photographer mom Gina has found a benefits-loaded teaching job at a college art department.
  Negative
The opening images of Rome whose welcome sign bears the slogan Where Culture is Home!
  Positive
are edgily shot and edited like the start of a horror flick, complete with ambient sounds.
  Positive
Think Stars Hollow from Gilmore Girls, but without the kitschy local color, endearingly eccentric citizenry and fewer places to buy coffee.
  Neutral
Shortly after they arrive at their roomy new abode with its mature trees, spacious lawns, multiple bathrooms and lack of urban noise, annoyances begin to pile up.
  Negative
First, the movers have yet to arrive with their earthly possessions.
  Neutral
Stay-at-home dad Mack, an easy-going jazz aficionado and published author in the midst of working on his sophomore novel, keeps suspiciously sniffing at the air in the kitchen turns out, theres mold lurking behind the walls.
  Very negative
Plus, he also writes articles about food and the gas range is inconveniently broken.
  Negative
As the threesome begins to meet and mingle with the locals, they are initially treated as welcome curiosities more for their big-city ways than anything else.
  Negative
A trio of tenured profs with  Janeane Garofalo as the ring leader take Gina under their wing and tutor her on the joys of chatty liquid lunches.
  Negative
Mack a bit adrift stumbles upon the seemingly friendly overseer of the block association and then, rather desperately, heads to the local book store to check to see if his first book is available there it isnt.
  Negative
Meanwhile, cute Clark quickly finds an eager fan base: two soon-to-be sixth-grade classmates who are precocious girls petite Ambrosia  Oona Laurence and gangly Julie  Miranda McKeon.
  Positive
Ambrosia, in particular, is excited by his arrival, proclaiming, We like totally needed a black kid.
  Negative
This town is SO white!
  Neutral
The pair entertain their new friend by showing off their inappropriately suggestive dance routine set to the music of a hip-hop performer known as  Bit, who we learn from Julie, used to be a ho.
  Positive
This is all a prelude to Ambrosias eventual attempts to put the moves on Clark at some point when they are alone in Julies unsupervised home.
  Negative
Matters go downhill when Ambrosias single mother  Christine Taylor, smartly navigating a difficult role catches her daughter and Clark semi-innocently goofing around on Julies bed.
  Negative
All this hyper-sexuality at an early age is rightfully treated with the seriousness it deserves and eventually builds to a much-needed clearing of the air between neighbors.
  Positive
But it also drains nearly all of the humor out of the movie.
  Negative
Sorrows are drowned in alcohol and cigarettes, arguments break out, an act of vandalism occurs and assumptions and accusations are made before a truce finally is called.
  Negative
Not even a lively bout of karaoke involving group sing of Gilbert and Sullivan as well as off-key Spandau Ballet solo can lighten the mood.
  Neutral
Little Boxes doesnt manage to summon as much unique insight into prejudice as screenwriter  Annie Howell and director Ron Meyer probably expected to achieve.
  Negative
But what keeps their movie watchable is that Lynskey, Ellis and Jackson are completely believable as a loving family unit going through a rough patch concerning their sense of identity and place as they uneasily adapt to a foreign and sometimes difficult situation.
  Positive
We want the best for them, despite their own occasional misguided judgments about people.
  Positive
But we would also like a better and more ambitious film for them, too, one that doesnt tell us something we already know and seen before.
  Positive
And, for those who are wondering, you will indeed hear a piano-heavy instrumental rendition of the song Little Boxes as the end credits roll.
  Negative
Too bad the lyrics are actually the best part.
  Neutral
