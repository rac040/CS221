Dreck the Halls.
  Neutral
O Unholy Night.
  Neutral
Jingle Hell.
  Negative
These are some of the not very good alternative titles I thought of while resisting the urge to bolt during Love the Coopers.
  Negative
The more curdled-than-cuddly holiday film already had offended this former copy editor even before I entered the theater.
  Negative
Its crime?
  Neutral
The lack of punctuation in its name.
  Negative
A third-grader would know there should be a comma after  Love since, as the holly-jolly folly of a clich-engorged opening montage confirms, it refers to the clans preferred salutation on their greeting cards that duly employs, yes, a comma.
  Negative
As it stands, it sounds like a command.
  Neutral
To which the correct response would be a resounding ho-ho-NO!
  Neutral
exclamation point included.
  Positive
Normally I would place most of the blame on director  Jessie Nelson  I Am Sam for delivering such a jumbled, toxic snow globe of a movie complete with a brewing storm, caustic quarreling and excessive caroling in an effort to undercut sentimentality.
  Neutral
But I suspect screenwriter  Steven Rogers " Hope Floats,"  Stepmom, is more to blame, if only for overstuffing the plot.
  Negative
There are too many trite storytelling devices, such as a narrator a la  A Christmas Story on top of flashbacks of past holiday memories with younger actors who barely look like their adult versions.
  Negative
That the voice belongs to  Steve Martin doesnt help a whit.
  Positive
There are too many characters to even attempt to care about.
  Negative
And there is too great of a reliance on music both yuletide and not Sting, Nina Simone and  Bob Dylan to fill in the emotional blanks.
  Negative
But at least Nelson, who tosses a cute kid or an adorable doggy into the proceedings like cheap tinsel whenever matters get too cynical, has managed to corral three Oscar winners and one recent nominee for her cast.
  Negative
They appear to reside in some sort of st-century Bedford Falls where it must be against the law to not smother your house or place of business with garish seasonal decorations as Santa Clauses gather en masse on the sidewalks like some North Pole edition of  West Side Story.
  Negative
Diane Keaton who fared much better in the faintly similar  dysfunctional-family holiday dramedy  The Family Stone is the matriarch, a Martha Stewart-type complete with festive apron who demands one more happy gathering with her extended family before she and husband  John Goodman announce they are separating after  years.
  Negative
What is forcing them apart?
  Neutral
Keaton is too wrapped up in their grown childrens lives and Goodman wants to finally take his long-postponed dream trip to Africa, with or without her.
  Negative
Marisa Tomei shows up as Keatons stereotypically spinster sister who is filled with resentment, low self-esteem and struggling with a shoplifting problem.
  Negative
The trouble is that the vivacious Tomei, who is  to Keatons , is neither believable as her sibling nor as a spinster.
  Negative
Alan Arkin, however, is not a bad fit as their father, whose attraction to  Amanda Seyfrieds lonely diner waitress who is  years younger than her co-star is supposed to be poignant when it really is downright creepy, even if the mention of  Charlie Chaplins attraction to a waifish blind girl in  City Lights supposedly makes it OK.
  Negative
Meanwhile, the wonderful  June Squibb is reduced to playing Aunt Fishy, an addled resident of an old folks home whose big scenes involve eating the roof of a gingerbread house and revealing her underpants as she did in  Nebraska.
  Negative
Others along for the ride include  Ed Helms as Keaton and Goodmans jobless son and father of three who is undergoing a divorce'  Olivia Wilde as their unlucky-in-love playwright daughter who prefers to hang out at the airport bar tossing back dirty martinis than spending one extra minute with the folks' and  Anthony Mackie, who provides diversity as well as subtlety as an reclusive police officer who catches Tomei in the act of stealing a brooch as a gift for her sister by hiding it in her mouth.
  Negative
There is a long list of naughty and not very nice lapses in logic and good taste for the sake of being edgy, before we get to the fearsome feast where everyone either says the wrong thing, or shares unpleasant revelations until someone lands face down in a bowl full of mashed potatoes.
  Very negative
Here are just a few examples: Is it funny that Helms angel-faced toddler daughter likes to repeat a phrase she heard her mom say to her dad: You are such a dick!?
  Negative
Is it amusing that Goodman has a habit of mangling lyrics of carols, such as singing brown yon virgin during Silent Night?
  Neutral
How is it that Keaton can spend the whole day hanging out with Goodman and their granddaughter doing fun Christmas stuff, and yet she can instantly whip up a fantasy spread of massive platters of elaborate dishes and desserts without breaking a sweat?
  Neutral
How is it proper that Helms allows his gawky teen son to make out with his girl crush in a hospital waiting area after a family member falls ill?
  Neutral
And why does a character have to come out as gay in a way that feels rather awkward and unrealistic?
  Negative
If there is any reason to watch all these shenanigans, it is the makeshift relationship that Wilde invents to impress her parents with a soon-to-be-deployed soldier  Jake Lacy, who was terrific in last years  Obvious Child and scores again here.
  Negative
There is something sad and yet authentic about her lack of connection with others and in how Lacys sincere military man is able to break down her defenses, despite her obsessive need to debase his political and religious beliefs Republican and Christian.
  Negative
At least Love the Coopers has the nerve to even bring up the topic of faith in a mainstream and primarily secular holiday film.
  Positive
But it loses most of those points with its odd choice of turning outdoor snowmen, gingerbread men and chocolate figurines into a Greek chorus that comments on the action with their silent scowls.
  Negative
Besides, as audiences leave they should provide plenty of disapproving reactions all on their own.
  Negative
