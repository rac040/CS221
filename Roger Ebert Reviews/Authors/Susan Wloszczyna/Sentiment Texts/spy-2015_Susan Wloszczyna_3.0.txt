As a distaff version of James Bond in Spy, Hollywoods reigning empress of ha-ha  Melissa McCarthy has a license not just to kill the audience with laughter but also to slay us with her acting skills.
  Negative
And its a bust-a-gut thing of beauty to watch her give a wholly satisfying lead performance with a complete dramatic arc.
  Positive
Just observe how her eyes dramatically moisten in reaction to her top-notch co-stars in ways that would make  Bette Davis proud.
  Positive
Thats even if her lips are spewing a scathing string of inappropriate R-rated putdowns.
  Negative
After her misbegotten turn last summer as a down-on-her-luck sadsack in  Tammy left even the most fervent Mike amp' Molly fans worried that the actress had lost her mouthy mojo although her supporting part in  St. Vincent provided some solace, it is gratifying to see her back in the arms of her best collaborator director  Paul Feig.
  Negative
The man behind her breakout in  Bridesmaids and her blockbuster pairing with  Sandra Bullock in  The Heat also steps up his game.
  Positive
He doesnt just shoot off a random round of in-jokes and sight gags Austin Powers-style.
  Negative
Feig also provides a decent if convoluted espionage plot complete with tense action sequences, a surprising twist and -inspired opening credits while spiked with a high percentage of gags that actually succeed.
  Positive
Most of the pleasure is derived from observing McCarthys sweet if insecure Susan Cooper grow from CIA analyst stuck working in a dank vermin-infested bunker to a highly skilled undercover sleuth seeking the whereabouts of a stolen nuke.
  Negative
She is equally at ease with posing as a Midwest cat lady or engaging in hand-to-hand battle a la  Jackie Chan against a female assailant in a confined kitchen space by employing baguettes, frying pans and lettuce as lethal weaponry.
  Negative
But when we first meet Cooper, she is performing her duties as a field agents earpiece while live-monitoring his whereabouts via satellite images and a body cam.
  Negative
Shes basically a human GPS who warns of impending threats and wrong turns into danger.
  Neutral
She yearns to go after the bad guys herself, but for now she is satisfied with assisting smug undercover dandy Bradley Fine a very-fine-indeed  Jude Law, clearly enjoying a contact high from being in such a free-wheeling ensemble romp, especially since she harbors a not-so-secret crush for him.
  Negative
But when it appears he has died on the job, Coopers exasperated boss  Allison Janney somewhat channeling her  Juno hubby J.K. Simmons decides to take a chance on sending her to Europe to hunt down the bad guys.
  Negative
As seen in previous films, McCarthy works best with others and Feig here provides a fine array of foils.
  Positive
British funny lady  Miranda Hart is a true find for anyone who hasnt seen Call the Midwife on PBS as Coopers well-meaning if clumsy sidekick Nancy who fills in as her earpiece.
  Positive
At -foot-, Hart looms over McCarthy and everyone else, and the two fit nicely into the mismatched tradition of Abbott and Costello and Laurel and Hardy.
  Negative
Someone, of course, has to be the cold-hearted villain and that would be Bridesmaids alum  Rose Byrne.
  Negative
With an elaborate hairdo that could double as a Byzantine sculpture and a constant look of disdain, Byrne crosses paths with Cooper when the agent poses as her bodyguard and the two take an instant dislike to each other.
  Negative
While McCarthy is no slouch in the insult department, Byrnes posh demeanor allows her to get away with some rather vile verbal slaps that would otherwise leave viewers groaning.
  Negative
But McCarthy truly meets her match in the form of British action star  Jason Statham, who goes wonderfully bonkers as a bratty rogue agent named Ford who is incensed that a newbie like Cooper is on the case and shows his disgruntlement by constantly bragging about his manly feats of yore like a Cockney Paul Bunyan Ive swirled enough microchips to shit a f kin computer.
  Negative
But what I found myself most appreciating about Spy went beyond the bouncy and brassy McCarthys regular servings of tasty bits of business dubbing her fists Cagney and Lacy, telling a stunned Swedish henchman to cut off his own manhood and stick it on his forehead like a unicorns horn, or accidentally mistaking a mushroom-like hot towelette for an appetizer.
  Negative
Instead, it was how Feig and company take the piss out of all the macho grandstanding and chauvinistic attitudes ingrained in the spy genre.
  Neutral
That would include Nancys observation that Fords tweed cap makes him look as if he is from the cast of  Newsies.
  Negative
But, mostly, McCarthy and her femme cohorts are too busy doing their jobs to be bothered with the sexist come-ons by the likes of Aldo, a harassing lug of a guardian who mostly wants to protect Coopers breasts.
  Negative
Although Harts Nancy does take a detour to get to hang with rapper  Cent a cameo that pays off better than one would think.
  Negative
All is not perfect, however.
  Negative
Having a male land atop a woman in an awkward position is sort of amusing once but not twice.
  Negative
And, as was the case with the crime caper The Heat, an excess of violence does get the point across that dames are as tough if not tougher than the dudes.
  Negative
But when thugs begin to pile up with reckless abandon and McCarthys Cooper barely flinches as she shoots her foes dead, it distracts from rather than enhances the humor at hand.
  Negative
But the true measure of a comedy is always how much you actually laugh.
  Positive
As long as the chuckles exceed the body count, all is good.
  Positive
