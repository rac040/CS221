Les Miserables feels as if it came out ages ago and, as much as I wore out my Four Seasons Gold Vault of Hits LP in my youth, this Sherry bay-ay-bee could not abide by  Clint Eastwoods underwhelming  Jersey Boys.
  Very negative
As for thenow-playing update ofAnnie, well, lets just say there is always tomorrow for Tomorrow.
  Positive
But then like a sirens song caressing my needy eardrums, I heard theopening notes oftheAct One Prologue of IntotheWoods with its hypnotic staccato-like lyrics andtheinsistent refrain of I wish I wish I wish.
  Negative
And, suddenly, my very being felt quenched just by being inthemisty midst of this much-delayed cinematic rendering of one of  Stephen Sondheims most popular shows.

Disney is behind thefilm adaptation of this melody-laden fracturing of fairy-tale myths, which onstage could be quite grim indeed as it upendsthetraditional notion that once upon a time always leads to happily ever after.

There has been much speculation aboutthesecond half and whether certain key adult-oriented elements that might not conform to a PG rating would makethecut.
  Negative
Rabid Sondheim-ites might quibble over how theviolence has been softened or kept off-screen, and despair thattheending isnt quite as bleak.
  Negative
But this is definitely no Mickey Mouse affair.Thecasting feels mostly flawless nicely modulatingthepotential comic-diva overload of having both  Christine Baranski and  Tracey Ullman, whose part is actually more serious, inthesame film.Thesinging is often splendid.Thebits ofhumorare deftly handled.Thepace is relatively swift.
  Negative
And it never feels like a static rendition of a theatrical event dumbed down for a younger demographic.
  Negative
And, most importantly, thethemes concerningtheunrealistic fantasies and desires that parents instill in their children that often result in unwanted consequences comes through loud and clear, thanks to  James Lapines adapted screenplay thats based on his own stage version.
  Negative
This effort might not get director  Rob Marshall entirely off thehook for his botched  Nine in  and it is nowhere near as star-packed, sophisticated and sexy as his  feature debut  Chicago.
  Negative
But he does a good job of keepingtheessential integrity ofthepiece intact.
  Positive
Plus, for those of us who are never happier than when there are a lot of people singing at one time, IntotheWoods regularly manages to be quite enchanting in its disenchantment about what life offersor doesnt.
  Negative
Theclever plot with its interwoven fables is propelled bytheBaker and his wife a well-matched James Corden and  Emily Blunt, whose attempts to have a baby have sadly failed.Intotheir shop whirlstheWitch  Meryl Streep, clearly enjoying herself even more than when she jumped on that bed in Mamma Mia!

She adds that they can undo their bad luck by collecting four objects in three days: Thecow as white as milk,thecape as red as blood,thehair as yellow as corn, andtheslipper as pure as gold."
  Negative
Thecow comes courtesy of Jack of beanstalk fame, gamely portrayed by  Daniel Huttlestone,thevery same lad who was street urchin Gavroche inthebig-screen Les Mis.Thecape refers totheapparel donned by Little Red Riding Hood, amusingly embodied by Broadway vet Lilla Campbell with plenty of brink-of-puberty brattiness.Thehair, as you might guess, is provided by a tower-dwelling Rapunzel  MacKenzie Mauzy, somewhat of a weak link in this lineup, who was raised bytheWitch as her own daughter.
  Negative
And, naturally,theshoe comes courtesy of Cinderella, done to a pitch-perfect hilt by  Anna Kendrick,who is turning into quitethemovie-musical mascot.
  Positive
All their paths eventually lead, as thetitle says,intothewoods.
  Negative
Its a scary place where many ofthecharacters lose their bearings, both morally, ethicallyand otherwise, and danger regularly lurks most notably intheform of  Johnny Depp astheWolf.
  Negative
He hungrily exhibits lupine lustiness towards Red Riding Hood, well-fed herself after conningtheBaker out of more than a few sweet samples.Theactors most effective assets are his lascivious vocals, Dali-esque whiskers and snazzy zoot suit with tantalizing faux gray-blue fur as designed bythegreat  Colleen Atwood.
  Negative
But hisappearance is brief and actually quite non-disruptive as far as zany Depp-ian interludes go.
  Positive
Its a rare role where he servesthework rather thantheother way around.

Eventually, everyones wish comes true in one form or another.
  Negative
Then, in thefinal act, everything falls apart, a matter aggravated bythetree-menacing intrusion of an angry she-giant anawkwardly done visual effect with a human actress who seeks revenge after Jack causes herequally largehusband to meet his demise.
  Negative
Death, infidelity, disillusionment and finger-pointing eventually result in a communal healing process that certainly will ring true to audiences who are regularly exposed to suchreal-lifeaftermaths inthewake of tragic disasters both natural and man-made these days.
  Negative
But  IntotheWoods wants to entertain as much as it wants to enlighten, thank goodness, and two standouts amongtheactors do more than their share to make sure thatthefirst goal is certainly met.
  Positive
Of course, Le Streep leaves practically everyone else inthedust and by design.

You'retheworld.Themighty Meryl also works her magic withthedialogue, giddily exclaiming Oh my God at one point as if she was a text-happy teenybopper.
  Negative
More surprising are theessential contributions of  Chris Pine, whose preening, poising and pompadoured prince initially struggles to sweep Kendricks Cinderella off her slipper-shod feet.
  Negative
His experience as that self-adoring intergalacticwomanizer Capt. Kirk inthecurrent  Star Trek franchise more than serves him well.
  Positive
Agony,theduet he shares with Rapunzels prince  Billy Magnussen as they compare their female troubles, istheone number duringthefilm that draws actual applause usually a rare event in movie theaters and one that I experiencedas well atmypackedscreening.
  Positive
If nothing else,  IntotheWoods will provide edifying sustenance for holiday crowds desperate to find a fitting movie to share with their family afterthegift-opening and feasting is over.
  Negative
Plus, it will act asa harmonic palate cleanser for all those stale Christmas carols that have been playing since Halloween.
