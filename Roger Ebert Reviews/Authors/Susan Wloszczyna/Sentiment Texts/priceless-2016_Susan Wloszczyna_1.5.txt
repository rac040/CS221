A sure sign that a character is a pimp?
  Negative
Hes the only guy in town who dons a tailored vest as casual everyday wear.
  Negative
How do you know a cop is corrupt?
  Neutral
When he looks like a wizened lowlife straight out of an R. Crumb comic book.
  Negative
And what might be a clue that an innocent-no-more female has been sexually used and abused?
  Negative
Her demure white-lace dress is torn at the shoulder, of course.
  Negative
In another era, Priceless could have made for a nasty grindhouse-era melodrama involving the human trafficking of vulnerable young women who are forced into prostitution by unsavory male slavers.
  Negative
But not in the hands of Joel and Luke Smallbone, the clean-cut Aussie-born siblings behind For King amp' Country, a Grammy-winning Christian pop group that has escaped my notice until now.
  Negative
In a brief intro to a special Thursday -night showing of this supposedly inspirational yet incredibly enervating parable, Joel the films leading man, who devised the story with brother Luke actually employed the the notion of chivalry to explain their intentions.
  Negative
That knights-to-the-rescue notion is further expanded upon by Joel in the press notes: Part of the DNA of For King amp' Country is this idea of respect and honor in relationships and women being priceless.
  Positive
Meaning, in this case, not for sale.
  Negative
But while the intentions behind Priceless might be honorable, the results are much less so.
  Negative
It was shot in just  days and looks it primarily in and around Albuquerque, NM.
  Negative
What should be a lean and taut thriller based on true stories is about as exciting as watching wet socks bounce around in the dryer.
  Positive
Too much about it feels cheap and generic, save for moments where characters enigmatically acknowledge a belief in a higher power in hushed reverent tones.
  Very negative
Nepotism must not be considered a sin by the Smallbone clan since another brother, Ben, who has previously done documentaries, ads, music videos and shorts, takes his bow as a feature director with Priceless.
  Negative
Meanwhile, Luke and father David act as producers.
  Neutral
But most the weight of carrying this faith-based co-opting of a horrific real-life issue rests on the broad shoulders of Joel, a tall, dark and ornately tattooed poster boy for come-hither facial scruff.
  Negative
As James Stevens, a once devoted spouse and father, he has lost his way after his wife suddenly died.
  Negative
He turns to drinking and brawling, and ends up losing both his job and custody of his grade-school daughter.
  Negative
This is my journey, James declares literally and figuratively in a voiceover just before he and the rest of the cast start tripping over the poorly constructed script.
  Negative
James jumps at the chance to make some easy cash by driving a box truck cross-country, its contents unknown his only caveat: no drugs.
  Negative
But he eventually discovers that he is delivering two Mexican sisters, Antonia  Bianca Santos and Maria, to a dingy inn dubbed Motel  in an unnamed Southwest community, and decides he must dedicate himself to saving his human cargo.
  Negative
Imagine if  Taxi Driver were devoid of any of the trademarks that turned it into a classic while  Robert De Niros Travis Bickle was stripped of his paranoid defining traits except for wanting to protect  Jodie Fosters teen street walker.
  Negative
The problem is, Smallbones main trait as an action hero is being totally inept.
  Negative
Whenever he comes across a firearm, he cant help but fumble it.
  Negative
At least twice, he rescues Antonia, only to have her protest that she cant leave her underage sister behind like, duh.
  Negative
He puts his makeshift sidekick, a local name Dale funny man  David Koechner, who isnt funny here, in constant danger.
  Very positive
And what is supposed to be a tension-filled telephone exchange with his daughter is one of the more clumsily staged scenes I have witnessed in some time.
  Negative
Fans of the bands music might be disappointed that an actual song isnt heard on the soundtrack until two-thirds of way through.
  Negative
And while the subject at hand is a serious one, Priceless could have done with some mood-lifting humor.
  Positive
I did laugh when Maria tells James that she wants to be a singer like  Taylor Swift.
  Positive
She then inquires if he likes Swift.
  Positive
No!
  Neutral
is James little-too-swift answer, though he admits his daughter does.
  Neutral
The main intention behind Priceless, besides allowing For King amp' Country to become involved in the movie business, seems to be a genuine desire to raise awareness of the horrors of the crime of trafficking, not that this PG- drama shows anything too graphic.
  Positive
But, on a purely entertainment level, all I know is when the end credits started rolling, I said to myself, Thank, God.
  Negative
