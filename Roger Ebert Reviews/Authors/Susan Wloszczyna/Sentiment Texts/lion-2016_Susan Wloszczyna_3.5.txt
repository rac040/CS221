Lion sneaks up on you as it proceeds to pluck your heart strings with its little cat feet.
  Positive
Then, before you know it, tear ducts will be brimming and your entire being will be awash with incredible joy but also a splash of bittersweet sorrow.
  Positive
At least that is what happened to those around me during the course of this incredible true story about a five-year-old Indian boy named Saroo, whose life is changed in  after being separated from his idolized older brother, ending up more than a thousand miles from his home and family.
  Positive
It's little wonder that Lion has collected quite a few audience awards at festivals since premiering in Toronto in September.
  Negative
Truly intelligent crowd-pleasers that avoid blatant manipulation are a rarity, but director  Garth Davis TVs Top of the Lake and screenwriter  Luke Davies mostly keep any sentimental overload at bay until the very end and, by that time, it is exactly what the audience needs and the film deserves.
  Very positive
Emotional triggers might arrive at several points during this decades-spanning tale of longing and loss that is also a mystery about an unknown past.
  Negative
For me, the killer moment was when the adult Saroo in the form of a beefed-up  Dev Patel, whose  breakout film  Slumdog Millionaire serves as a sort of companion piece to Lion finally and somewhat guiltily confesses to his Australian adoptive mother, Sue, that he has been spending countless days doing research while seeking out his birth family via Google Earth.
  Negative
The reason for his secrecy?
  Neutral
He did not want to hurt the two incredibly generous and supportive people who rescued him from a Dickensian existence filled with poverty, hunger and potential abuse after being taken to a big-city facility for homeless street children.
  Negative
Being adopted as an infant myself, I know that feeling all too well, which is why I still refer to my mother and father who raised me simply as my parents, with no qualifier.
  Negative
But that is topped soon after by a revelation shared by Sue, a tower of maternal tenderness and immense devotion embodied by  Nicole Kidman, who is excellent despite a distractingly awful curly red wig.
  Positive
She uses the occasion to finally explain to Saroo exactly why she and his father, John  David Wenham, best known as Faramir in The Lord of Rings, decided to adopt him.
  Positive
Kidman, herself an adoptive mother of two, delivers her words with such nakedly honest emotion, all the Kleenex in the world wont stop the ensuing flood.
  Positive
Not that you need to be adopted to be so touched.
  Negative
After all, the primal fear of suddenly becoming lost and separated from those you care about most is a universal one.
  Positive
The first  minutes or so of Lion preys upon such anxiety, heightened by its visually poetic boys-eye-view camera work by  Greig Fraser, in a way that anyone can relate.
  Positive
What is truly amazing is that the lions share of the acting during this early stage is by a untrained newcomer, Mumbai native Sunny Pawar, who won the part after thousands of children were screen-tested.
  Negative
The kid is a natural, equal parts waif and rascal with an expressive face that perfectly reflects his state of mind from scene to scene while often not saying word.
  Positive
Nothing against Patel, who has grown immensely as a performer, but without the groundwork laid by little Sunny, Lions  onscreen roar would definitely be more than a bit muted.
  Very negative
In fact, the key relationship is the one the young Saroo shares with his adored older brother, Guddu an engaging Abhishek Bharate, that is established right off the bat.
  Positive
While their hard-working single mother watches over their sister, the pair goes off to steal coal from trains to trade for milk.
  Negative
One night, Saroo begs Guddu to take him on his rounds as he sneaks onto empty trains for dropped money and other lost items.
  Negative
But they become separated after Saroo falls asleep on a station-platform bench.
  Negative
When he awakes, he panics after finding himself alone and boards a locomotive that suddenly begins to move and doesnt stop until it arrives in the bustling city of Kolkata formerly Calcutta.
  Negative
Saroo cant speak the local language Bengali as opposed to Hindi and he cant even pronounce the name of his village correctly.
  Negative
Eventually, he is reduced to sleeping in tunnels and stealing food from public shrines.
  Negative
But somehow his innate street smarts kick in, allowing Saroo to survive long enough to be happily rescued from a potentially dire fate.
  Negative
The later portion of the film that unfolds after Saroo is adopted cant compete with such a compelling opening, but by then we are fully invested in what will happen to this now grown man.
  Neutral
As Patel takes over the role, we see a bright and confident Saroo enroll in a hospitality course in Melbourne and fall for a fellow classmate a mostly wasted  Rooney Mara in supportive girlfriend mode.
  Negative
The one downside is when his parents also adopt a much more traumatized and distant Indian lad to be his new brother, a stark contrast to his deep trusting bond with Guddu.
  Negative
All it takes is a run-in with an Indian fried-dough treat known as jalebis served at a party to eventually ignite Saroos hunger to reconnect with his roots.
  Positive
That search requires Patel to brood, stroke his beard and obsessively sit in front of a computer as his apartment walls increasingly look like a detectives patchwork paper-trail of photos and other clues to a puzzle not exactly high drama.
  Negative
But all is forgiven when his memory clicks in and his hard work pays off beautifully.
  Positive
Lets just say if you are human, there is no way that Lion wont move you.
  Negative
