Miles Ahead is a film of ugly, bold bravado.
  Negative
Images move in and out of focus, at times without reason.
  Neutral
The camera often sits in unexpected places down an alley near the dumpster, languidly careening from one persons mouth to another during a conversation, holding onto the corner of a face.
  Negative
There are so many textures and sounds and colors to the film sheened afros, silk the color of ocean water and crimson, supple dark brown skin, glimmering diamonds, blood marring the collar of a crisp tan shirt, unhinged laughter it veers toward sensory overload.
  Positive
Its this impressionistic flavor that gives the film its crackling, memorable energy.
  Positive
But the moment that got under my skin is perhaps the quietest one in the film.
  Positive
Its the aftermath of a fight between  Miles Davis  Don Cheadle and his wifemuse, Frances Taylor  Emayatzy Corinealdi.
  Positive
She wakes up in bed to find a pile of gifts lying next to her fine furs, dresses, and glimmering jewels.
  Negative
Miles cant or wont see it when he comes behind her to place the diamond and ruby necklace around her neck but her face looks like a seam about to split.
  Negative
The jewels seem less beautiful when you realize theyre in memory of wounds Miles has inflicted.
  Negative
The look of pained yearning across Frances face communicates their marriage is doomed more than any moment prior.
  Negative
Miles Ahead could have easily become a piece of treacly hagiography, more caught up in black cool rather than the suffering that underscores it.
  Negative
Its to Don Cheadles credit who not only stars as Miles but directed, produced, and co-wrote the film that he doesnt fall into the trap that far too many biopics do where the actor is so caught up worshiping the legend theyre playing that they cant see them for the complicated, at times even vile, human beings they really are.
  Negative
Cheadle chooses to eschew many expectations by zeroing in on Miles fallow period in the late s and providing surprising flashbacks that jolt us through his past.
  Positive
When we meet Miles, hes a ragged sketch of a man.
  Negative
Hes falling apart even though his bravado could fool you otherwise, at least for a moment.
  Negative
The framing device involves Miles interviewed by Dave  Ewan McGregor, a Rolling Stone reporter eager to find out what Miles has been up to during the years of his absence.
  Negative
Dave quickly gets swept up in the chaotic world of his subject, who just as quickly turns his discerning gaze on him as he does himself.
  Negative
The main plot involves a mysterious session tape that Miles record company is eager to get their hands on.
  Negative
The tape entices a slimy manager, Harper Hamilton  Michael Stuhlbarg, entwined in the proceedings, who tries to use it to boost the career of his incredibly talented, junkie client, Junior  Keith Stanfield.
  Negative
This plotline and Daves entire existence is pure fiction.
  Positive
None of this should work, but the mix of unexpected humor, genuine pathos, and bristling energy is enough to forgive the s plot thread for its faults.
  Positive
Biopics work best when not focusing on the minutiae of fidelity but on the emotional truths of their subjects.
  Positive
Cheadles performance is pure elegant vulgarity.
  Very positive
He curses as if he is speaking poetry.
  Positive
He carries himself like a man who has lived a thousand lives.
  Positive
He cares less about Miles cool than he does about the tragedies hes inflicted upon himself and others.
  Negative
The way he cares for the man is evident in his performance by the honesty that comes with each moment, whether it be Miles whipping out a gun in Columbia Records or asking Frances to marry him as two naked women lie in his bed in the next room.
  Negative
The performance echoes his work as Mouse in the neo- noir Devil in a Blue Dress but theres more pathos and craft here.
  Negative
Cheadle keenly understands the darkness of Miles but doesnt condescend.
  Negative
Instead he presents all his contradictions and guises the addict, the sharply dressed genius, the madman, the lover, the unfaithful yet loving husband.
  Positive
The film finds a sense of balance through a few great supporting performances.
  Positive
McGregor brings an engaging levity to the proceedings and creates a comfortable rapport with Cheadle.
  Very positive
The push and pull between them is the stuff of legendary buddycop dynamics.
  Positive
As Junior, who feels like a curious mirror to Miles, Stanfield has some standout moments that deliver on the promise he presented in  Short Term ."
  Positive
But if the MilesDave dynamic was all there was to the film.
  Neutral
it would be a fun, occasionally astute, creative piece of work but it wouldnt be wholly memorable beyond the performances.
  Positive
The film finds its true emotional epicenter when it pivots back to the past, focusing on the courtship then troubled marriage between Miles and Frances.
  Positive
Frances doesnt appear in any of present day scenes except when fantasy and reality crash into one another and he sees an image of her which shouldnt be in his home or hears her voice as if she is coming around the corner.
  Negative
Shes the wound of his past he can not stitch' a ghost appearing when he least expects it.
  Negative
Muses arent wholly people or at least theyre rarely allowed to be.
  Negative
So often in the biopics of artists, their muse figures feel less like wholly realized women and more like myths.
  Negative
When two artists get into a relationship, particularly a heterosexual one, only one tends to remain the creative.
  Negative
The other becomes caretaker, lover, muse, a tabula rasa to be reflected on, a source of energy to be drained.
  Very negative
When Miles meets Frances shes a dancer of incredible grace.
  Positive
We dont get their marriage chronologically instead we chart the downfall of their love affair as if moving through memory.
  Negative
The past and present bleed onto each other.
  Negative
A word or sound causes Miles reverie to pivot to his wedding day or the night hes so delirious after surgery he imagines that Frances is cheating on him and grows unhinged in his abuse.
  Negative
Frances is a role that could easily be a shrill punchline, an empty emblem to show Miles issues.
  Negative
But Corinealdi is too assured an actress with too strong a presence to be sidelined.
  Negative
Cheadles performance, which is perhaps the best of his career, or at least the most inventive, could easily subsume hers.
  Positive
Miles is like the sun pulling everyone into his orbit, or, more aptly, a black hole few escape.
  Negative
But Corinealdi emboldens Frances with an intelligence and steeliness that is hard to ignore.
  Negative
She easily holds her own against Cheadle even stealing a few scenes from him in the process.
  Positive
I want to revisit the film again and again to study the way she uses her body, voice, and gaze to create such a beautifully realized performance.
  Very positive
With just the slow drag of a cigarette or downcast eye, she communicates an entire history.
  Negative
In the scenes of their courtship, there are moments of startling beauty seeing these two dark- skinned actors beautifully lit, creating and inspiring each other' falling in love.
  Very positive
Part of the beauty is in h ow rare such an image is of two dark-skinned black artists given humanity.
  Positive
But the Eden they create for each other is short-lived.
  Positive
As their relationship grows more intense, he doesnt change his ways but expects her to.
  Neutral
After being beaten by white cops and spending a few hours in jail, the couple is back to the comfort of their own home.
  Negative
She tenderly bathes him.
  Positive
Its then he asks her to give up dancing for good, as if he role as his wife is enough to feed her soul.
  Positive
Frances reels back in disgust and anger.
  Negative
But she eventually agrees.
  Positive
Its a decision she comes to regret.
  Negative
Its also a mistake Ive seen many women make.
  Negative
Eventually the weight of Miles faults become too heavy for even Frances love to bear.
  Negative
The story of their love and the artistmuse dynamic that underscores it could be a film on its own, perhaps even a better one than what we got.
  Positive
As a director, Cheadle is able to deftly shift between time periods, moods, music and tones.
  Positive
The lush cinematography, inventive editing, which is more interested in capturing emotion than outright clarity, and crackling energy makes this film less a biopic and more a poem in motion about one of the most important American artists of the last one hundred years.
  Very positive
It does justice to Miles Davis by turning a light into the darkest corners of his soul while still giving him added complexity with dashes of lurid humor and the flashbacks that show him at better times.
  Negative
Still, Miles Ahead unravels at the end under the weight of the frankly ridiculous main narrative about the session tape.
  Negative
Theres one too many fired guns, car chases, overcooked moments overloaded with machismo, and bloodied fist for it to stay grounded emotionally.
  Very negative
But there is a quiet brilliance to the film that left me electrified, inspired, challenged like all great films should.
  Positive
It doesnt wholly work, but when it does it sings.
  Negative
