Early in Queen of the Desert, Gertrude Bells father recounts a story to her about her first words spoken as a child that encompasses the entirety of her identity and disposition.
  Negative
Apparently, when her nanny tried to put her in a dress she pushed the woman away and proudly exclaimed On my own!
  Negative
Bell is quickly established as an impetuous, headstrong, and intelligent woman, disregarding social mores at every turn.
  Negative
That shes a woman in the late s, when the story begins, yearning to explore the world rather than be saddled with an ill-suited marriage makes her all the more remarkable.
  Negative
The film briefly flirts with the idea that maybe Bell was simply born in the wrong time.
  Negative
But has there ever been a time accepting women this fearsome, bright, and independent?
  Positive
Despite the rich biographical material of the real-life woman on which this is based and the skill of the filmmakers involved, Queen of the Desert ends up being an emotionally empty, thematically ill-defined, and listless affair.
  Negative
It is never able to communicate the complexity of the woman at its center.
  Negative
The story begins in  as Bell played by  Nicole Kidman rankles her parents with desires of exploring the world and challenging herself intellectually instead of finding the appropriate suitor.
  Negative
Shes quickly shipped off to relatives in Tehran in the hope shell find some satisfaction.
  Negative
The narrative tracks her life and travels leading up to her collaboration with Winston Churchill  Christopher Fulford in mapping the borders of Iraq, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia.
  Negative
This is the time of the Ottoman Empires last days as various nations become mired in World War I. International upheaval, as viewed from the intimate vantage point of a historical figure as enchanting and modern feeling as Bell, gives the filmmakers a variety of avenues to explore.
  Positive
But instead of hinging the emotional through-line on her ambition, proto-feminist leanings, or what made her so well-suited to navigating the tribal conflicts, the film focuses on the most prosaic aspect of this fascinating woman: her love life.
  Negative
This is already a curious decision on its own.
  Negative
But that there is no blistering chemistry, no charm, no intensity in the romantic storylines makes matters worse.
  Very negative
Id rather further explore Bells inquisitiveness than watch Kidman try and fail to convince us that shes in enamored with  James Franco, who plays the first love interest Henry Cadogan.
  Negative
Franco is lost in the period trappings.
  Negative
Whenever he wasnt onscreen I forgot he was in the film altogether.
  Positive
The dynamic he develops with Kidman is neither a convincing portrait of passion nor an evocation of two intellectual equals coming together.
  Negative
That this love story, which consumes much of the beginning of the film, is meant to be a crucial part of Bells characterization is laughable.
  Negative
This is the man that has her so undone after seeming so sure of her own independence?
  Negative
Bells more interesting romantic entanglement that bookends the film is with Charles Doughty-Wylie an intriguing  Damian Lewis, a married British Army officer.
  Positive
Bell also has a lovely and blessedly platonic rapport with colleague, T.E. Lawrence  Robert Pattinson.
  Positive
Both Lewis and Pattinson bring very different energies, leading their scenes to intermittently spark with a much-needed liveliness.
  Positive
It isn't quite enough, though.
  Negative
And while Kidman is dedicated to the role, this is one of her most pallid performances in recent memory.
  Negative
On paper, this seems like the perfect role for Kidman, a typically resplendent and magnetic performer.
  Positive
Even in the worst films shes committed to mining the trials of her characters to make a larger point about humanity.
  Very negative
But even she cant bring much gravitas to a film that seems to lack any cohesive thematic perspective.
  Negative
Writerdirector  Werner Herzog makes the fatal error of confusing loving his star and subject with understanding her.
  Negative
The lugubrious voiceover provides no deeper understanding of Bell.
  Negative
If anything, it makes her seem like even more of cipher.
  Negative
In forming such a reverential biopic the humanity of these characters and Herzog's own wildness are whittled away, leaving the mere husk of a more interesting story behind.
  Negative
Every obstacle Bell encounters melts too quickly in the face of her wit and intelligence.
  Negative
Shes a vision of perfection.
  Positive
At times, shes lit in a way that her blonde hair radiates as if a halo making her seem even more angelic.
  Negative
But perfection isnt interesting in a biopic such as this' its a death knell.
  Negative
Its clear Herzog is trying to craft Queen of the Desert within the lineage of the traditional star vehicle.
  Negative
From the epic Gone with the Wind to the intense The Little Foxes, classic Hollywood was able to create films that operated as lush, at times bombastic spectacles in order to showcase the strengths of their leading ladies.
  Positive
But instead of heightening Kidmans qualities her luminescence, chilliness, and finely wrought emotional intelligence Queen of the Desert flattens these traits.
  Positive
It takes more than a sweeping score, beautiful cinematography, and drawn out narrative to make an engaging star vehicle.
  Very positive
More than anything they require a strong personality and point of view from both director and star, which is regrettably in short supply here.
  Positive
"Queen of the Desert" is so focused on Bell's romantic life that it fails to develop anything else about her.
  Negative
What pulls this woman to explore these different cultures and face-off with far more powerful men keen on underestimating her?
  Neutral
At one point Bell says in voiceover, For the first time in my life I know who I am.
  Negative
By the end of the film I still didnt.
  Positive
Instead I was left with questions.
  Neutral
Why was Bell so drawn to her line of work?
  Negative
How did she reckon with being so blindingly ambitious in a time in which the exact opposite was encouraged in women of her stature?
  Neutral
What drew her to specifically travel this part of the world?
  Neutral
While the people around her cringingly toast to the British Empire with little care to the colonization that makes their wealth possible, Bell genuinely cares for the people she crosses in her travels through the Middle East.
  Negative
She garners their respect and admiration in turn for reasons the film never seeks to explore with much depth.
  Positive
The decision to focus on Bells romantic life as the core of the story could be more worthwhile if any characters had a psychological richness to them.
  Positive
One of the biggest mistakes of Queen of the Desert is in not interrogating the nature of Bells ambition.
  Negative
Currently, womens ambition is at a premium.
  Negative
Its seen in the marketing of brands, the recently erected bronze Fearless Girl statue in Wall Street, and explored in recent works like " Big Little Lies."
  Negative
This gives Bells struggle between her own desires and social constraints a timely quality.
  Positive
Ambition, particularly for women, is a tricky attribute.
  Negative
Its a trait shaped by class, race, and access.
  Positive
It can be both destructive and admirable.
  Positive
For Bell it comes across as both, given whats sacrificed at the altar of her pursuit of intellectual and professional desires.
  Negative
Its a worthwhile subject matter to explore.
  Positive
Unfortunately, its given only cursory interest in various one-liners about Bells independence or in the simplistically rendered showdowns she has with powerful men, as if that is enough.
  Negative
Queen of the Desert demonstrates how staid a biopic can become when it forgets the icons at its center were also once human beings teeming with dreams, sins yearnings and contradictions.
  Negative
People are drawn to these kinds of stories not to see beautiful recreations of facts they can look up on Wikipedia but to take an intimate view on the human beings that made history.
  Positive
