I dont need that, Ellen Amy Hargreaves says, taking off her wedding ring during her first hotel tryst with protagonist Travis  Matt McGorry.
  Negative
Its a disingenuous moment that encapsulates the lack of emotional honesty that permeates How He Fell in Love.
  Negative
Directed and written by  Marc Meyers, the story follows Travis, an uninspired musician meandering through his early 's in one of the most lifeless renditions of New York ever put to film.
  Negative
Hes still hung up on an ex-girlfriendmusic partner whose wedding he sullenly attends in the opening scene.
  Negative
That is until he gets involved with the older, married yoga instructor, Ellen.
  Negative
Their affair, unsurprisingly, upends their lives and identities, forcing them to address major issues that being together brings to the surface.
  Negative
For Travis, all his issues are brought upon by his inability to do much with his life despite the opportunities.
  Neutral
For Ellen, there are more issues at hand, including her faltering marriage to Henry  Mark Blum, who is  years older than her.
  Negative
Neither Travis nor Ellen seem to care all that much about the weight of the decision theyve made and how it affects other people.
  Neutral
Theyre bored with their lives, and this is just the easiest way to get the change they keep complaining that they need.
  Very negative
If How He Fell in Love had more energy and a bit more of a sense of humor it would almost come across as a parody of the sort of aimless, minor key romantic dramas that come out year after year with little in the way to differentiate them.
  Negative
Every choice made for the film, from the mostly white cast of characters to the framing and color palette is offensively generic, even if How He Fell in Love is too forgettable to feel like a misfire.
  Very negative
The story doesnt provide the characters enough complications or personality, so its hard to imagine it ever being great, even in the hands of a better director.
  Negative
Although, if the actors had more chemistry maybe it wouldnt be so middling.
  Negative
This is the film's biggest issue.
  Positive
How can you craft a love story when your leads have barely any chemistry?
  Neutral
When these two say I love you it comes across like words theyre just trying on to hear how they sound, not because there is any deep connection between the two.
  Negative
Every time they describe their romance as spectacular or indescribable it becomes more and more laughable.
  Negative
The acting starts off capable even if it reflects the same lifelessness of the film itself, but as the story continues the performances only magnify script issues that become unbearable.
  Negative
Its as if even the actors dont believe the lines theyre saying.
  Neutral
An argument between Ellen and Henry towards the end is the best example: Shes become a shrill clich, he pivots emotionally from calm resignation to fury thats hard to make sense of since hes so thinly written.
  Negative
Watching How He Fell in Love I was left wondering, who are these people?
  Negative
They have a smattering of personality traits but not much in the way of a well-thought out emotional landscape.
  Negative
Travis is an especially odd choice for a leading character.
  Neutral
Hes not conflicted or charming in the way the character needs to be for this story to work, and McGorry is neither talented nor charismatic enough to make the character come to life.
  Negative
His line readings often come across as if hes not sure the character is trying to make a terrible joke or is actually being earnest.
  Negative
Ellen is a bit more complicated, as her inability to have kids becomes a major component of her character, but she becomes more and more unlikeable as the film goes on.
  Negative
In a different world, How He Fell in Love could be a critique on the ways people chase the high that comes with new, illicit romance despite the obvious danger that lies ahead, but the film is too timid to skewer its characters and make any bold choices.
  Negative
There are a few interesting subplots that had the potential to say something, anything about the human condition.
  Positive
Monica  Britne Oldford is Travis somewhat girlfriend who wants more from him than hes willing to give.
  Negative
It sets up what could have been an exploration of the sort of prickly dynamics that come with modern dating thanks to technology and nebulously defined relationships, but Meyers drops that idea before its allowed to gain any weight.
  Negative
At the beginning, I wondered how different the film would be if told from his perspective.
  Negative
Meyers is smart to not make Henry cruel or cold.
  Positive
If anything hes a good husband who loves Ellen, just not in the way she wants him to, and Mark Blum infuses a sweetness in the character that makes him easy to feel for.
  Positive
This makes the films morality complicated in a good way.
  Positive
But again, Meyers doesnt examine this, instead choosing to write Henry as downright nonsensical during the last act in a way that contradicts how hes been previously used to create drama.
  Negative
Sure, this provides twists but it doesnt feel honest.
  Positive
What makes a good love story in the first place?
  Positive
Chemistry is, of course, vital.
  Negative
The warmth and sexual tension between two actors can elevate a story from being mediocre to outstanding or ruin a potentially great one.
  Positive
A good love story doesnt need to be grand to impact the audience.
  Positive
There are many love stories with an arc from first kiss to heartbreak that plays in a minor key, but they need chemistry and a point of view to feel like they matter.
  Neutral
Despite how much these characters go on and on about their lives and loves, the film itself has nothing to say.
  Negative
