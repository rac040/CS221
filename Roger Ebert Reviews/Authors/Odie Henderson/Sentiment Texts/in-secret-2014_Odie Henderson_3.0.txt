I have not read "Thrse Raquin," the   Emile Zola novel upon which "In Secret" is based.
  Negative
A little research revealed that Zola's serialized story of adultery, murder and marriages, both arranged and desired, has been adapted numerous times.
  Negative
"Thrse Raquin" has been remade as a German silent film, TV movies in Belgium, Italy, Sweden, Germany and the UK, a BBC radio play and an opera.
  Negative
French director Marcel Carn cast  Simone Signoret in his  film version, and  Park Chan-wook worked several plot elements into his  vampire movie, " Thirst."
  Negative
A little research also revealed that the ripest plot elements of "In Secret" come straight from its source.
  Negative
This explains the TV movies, the opera and the vampires, all of which thrive when fed a good, soapy, trashy story.
  Negative
I enjoy being fed one, too.
  Positive
"In Secret" was roundly panned when it played at last year's Toronto Film Festival, but to paraphrase and reverse Shakespeare's Marc Antony, I have come to praise it, not to bury it.
  Negative
Director  Charlie Stratton wraps his adaptation in the appropriate period dress of Zola's era.
  Positive
In  th  century France, Madame Raquin  Jessica Lange is visited by her brother, who leaves young Thrse  Lily Laight in her charge.
  Negative
Madame puts Thrse to work taking care of Madame's heir, Camille.
  Positive
Camille is a sickly boy whose coughing keeps Thrse awake in the bed they share' she pulls the bedcovers over her head in frustration.
  Negative
Courtesy of the film's editor, when Thrse pulls the bed covers down, she has morphed into  Elizabeth Olsen.
  Negative
Now , Thrse is forced by Madame into an arranged marriage with her first cousin.
  Negative
Camille  Tom Felton moves Mom and wife to Paris, where he starts his career and meets up with an old family friend named Laurent  Oscar Isaac.
  Negative
To support Camille, Madame and Thrse open up the gloomiest looking shop in town.
  Negative
It's designed and lit like a mausoleum, and though people come and go, I don't recall seeing anyone buy anything.
  Negative
More important activities happen upstairs in the living quarters anyway.
  Neutral
There, Madame plays dominoes with her wards and fellow members of her class.
  Negative
Her contemporaries talk of the most morbid of subjects, including the foreshadowing topics of scandalous murder and the gruesome aftermath one witnesses at the morgue.
  Negative
Soon, Madame's wards will also become knowledgeable of the contents of the local morgue: Camille makes the fatal mistake of bringing Laurent to visit one evening.
  Negative
Camille may be French, but his skills dans le boudoir are far from ooh-la-la.
  Negative
So when the sexually frustrated Thrse takes one look at the dark haired, brooding Laurent, her libido starts doing the Can-Can.
  Negative
Immediately, she and Laurent begin an affair.
  Negative
Their lunchtime trysts occur above the shop, right under the nose of Madame, but go undetected.
  Negative
Have you not ears, woman?!
  Neutral
Unlike in the pulpiest fiction, these nooners seem more a cynical matter of convenience than an all-consuming passion Thrse is horny and Laurent can no longer afford the brothel.
  Negative
Camille, of course, is completely unaware of his betrayal, at least until he winds up at the bottom of the river.
  Negative
Stratton wisely withholds the murder at first, cutting directly to the agonized cries of the murderers pretending to be upset at the "accidental" death.
  Negative
For a time, we're left to ponder who did the killing and how it transpired.
  Negative
When Camille's body is finally pulled from his watery grave and delivered to the morgue, Laurent discovers it's just as gross as Madame's domino buddies described.
  Negative
Thus begins his downfall.
  Negative
With Camille out of the picture, the lovers try to figure out how to get together publicly without arousing suspicion.
  Negative
"In Secret" finds an unpredictable way around this by playing up the cluelessness of Madame's domino buddies.
  Negative
They misread everything by filtering the obvious through a prism of societal sexism and individual idiocy.
  Negative
This has a major payoff later.
  Positive
For now, their obliviousness is hilarious: "Thrse has been sick with grief!
  Positive
She must need another husband!
  Neutral
Now whom can she marry?
  Neutral
Ah yes, Laurent!"
  Neutral
So far, we have the noir element of lovers who kill to be together.
  Neutral
"In Secret" now adds the juicy, soap opera components.
  Positive
The film becomes haunted by Camille's ghost, which the guilty see in their grisly dreams and Madame literally sees the moment before she experiences a life-changing event.
  Negative
Thrse and Laurent turn on each other' their guilt becomes a bucket of ice water on their sex-based relationship.
  Negative
Thanks to the marriage, neither can leave, so they each consider killing the other. "
  Negative
Body Heat" has now become "War of the Roses."
  Neutral
With ghosts.
  Neutral
The actors approach this material with varying degrees of success.
  Positive
Isaac is a better in his early scenes as a seducer, Olsen is better in her bitter, angry later scenes, but they synch up by the film's over-the-top last moments.
  Negative
Felton is suitably foppish and dopey.
  Negative
Shirley Henderson plays the hell out of a scene that seems inspired by " The Shining."
  Negative
None of them, however, can match Jessica Lange.
  Negative
Those years on "American Horror Story" have convinced me that Lange can bring credibility to the most ridiculous plot twists.
  Negative
Somehow, she finds the perfect line of lunacy to tow, which "In Secret" requires for her character's arc.
  Positive
She goes from villainous to victimized to vengeful, stopping along the way for what I'll simply describe as an extremely important game of charades.
  Positive
The plot forces a late-movie restriction on her performance, and her handling of it made me want to throw roses at the diva onscreen.
  Negative
"In Secret" is a costume drama with a gigantic accent on the drama.
  Positive
It's my kind of crazy, and I was quite entertained.
  Positive
To borrow again from Shakespeare, "'Tis Madness, but there's method to't."    .
  Negative
