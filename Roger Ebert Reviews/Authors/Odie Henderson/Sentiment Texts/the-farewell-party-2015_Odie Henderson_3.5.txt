The Farewell Party is a bittersweet tragicomedy about a very thorny issue: assisted suicide and the right to die.
  Negative
It is, quite often, a very funny film, as mischievous as the youth that has long since left its characters, but not once does it treat its serious subject matter lightly.
  Very positive
Its stance on the matter is evident early on, and its sure to ruffle more than a few feathers.
  Negative
Yet, rather than bludgeon its detractors or preach to its choir, The Farewell Party adapts a more effective, low-key approach, casually interacting with the moral and religious issues inherent in its premise.
  Negative
Whether you agree with the decisions made by its terminally ill senior citizens, The Farewell Party loses none of its power.
  Negative
If nothing else, it forces you to think about what you would do when placed in their situation.
  Negative
The film opens with a call from God to Zelda Ruth Geller.
  Negative
God is actually Yehezkel Zeev Revach, her neighbor in the Jerusalem assisted living facility.
  Neutral
Yehezkel does these masked voice calls to inspire Zelda to keep taking her medicine and to live with her aches and pains.
  Neutral
There are no vacancies up here right now, Yehezkel says of Heaven, so you must stay down there.
  Negative
When the call is abruptly, comically disconnected, Zelda does the smart thing: She star-s the lost call.
  Positive
Yehezkels wife, Levana Levana Finklestein answers, telling Zelda God is indisposed in the bathroom and cannot come to the phone.
  Negative
Its low humor, I admit, but I laughed.
  Negative
Theres an infectious joy to how the actors handle the morbid humor here, and it is never mean-spirited.
  Neutral
Later, its revealed Zelda knew it was Yehezkel all along.
  Negative
Writer-directors  Tal Granit and  Sharon Maymon successfully walk a fine line between light humor and heavier drama.
  Positive
Their characters are not without respect for the gravity of their situation, but they are also old enough to have developed a humor-laced and fearless acceptance of impending death.
  Negative
Levana, the voice of moral reason for the early passages of the film, and the spokesperson for maturity throughout, aptly describes her husband and their cohorts: "Their bodies are old but they're still children inside.
  Positive
One of those cohorts is Yana Aliza Rosen, whose husband, Max Samuel Wolf sets the plot in motion.
  Negative
Max has been suffering in great pain with terminal cancer.
  Negative
Max wants to die but any form of assistance in this matter is illegal in Israel.
  Neutral
Taking him to Switzerland, where this is legal, is discussed but Max is so weak he wouldnt be able to make the trip.
  Negative
However, there are no autopsies performed on terminal patients, so if someone were to assist Max, it would probably go undetected.
  Neutral
Citing Dr. Kevorkian, inventor Yehezkel decides to build a machine that would allow the patient to self-administer a concoction that would painlessly kill him or her.
  Negative
Levana is violently opposed to this, on every ground imaginable.
  Positive
Its morally suspect, religiously wrong and completely illegal, she notes.
  Negative
Her anger at Yehezkel is palpable, but he proceeds anyway, seeking out a doctor at the assisted living facility who has experience with these things.
  Negative
That doctor, Dr. Daniel  Ilan Dar turns out to be a veterinarian.
  Negative
At first, he thinks Max is a dog.
  Neutral
Once that gets cleared up, he, like Maxs actual doctor, turns Yana and Yehezkel down.
  Negative
After much convincing, however, Dr. Daniel offers to help, roping in a cop named Rafael Rafi Tabor to help them conceal any evidence.
  Negative
Dr. Daniel also provides the medical knowledge and the concept of patient self-administering.
  Positive
Against Levanas wishes, Yehezkel builds the device.
  Positive
It is not a spoiler to state that the device gets used at least once in The Farewell Party, activated by the patient in question who wishes to use it.
  Negative
It is also no spoiler to mention that Yehezkels willingness to employ his machine will be reconsidered when someone much closer to him than Max falls ill and wishes to use the device.
  Negative
Levana is in the early stages of dementia, and as The Farewell Party progresses, her symptoms get worse.
  Negative
Her episodes come without warning, from not remembering how many eggs shes used in the cookie recipe shes making with her granddaughter to an embarrassing nude appearance in public.
  Negative
While she and her daughter Noa Hilla Surjon look for nursing homes for Levana to reside in once she fully succumbs to the disease, Yehezkel lives in denial.
  Negative
His hypocritical response when Levana starts considering her own demise builds the film to its haunting climax.
  Neutral
This is clearly heavy, controversial material, but The Farewell Party somehow manages to stitch these moments of high drama with a steady stream of occasionally ribald humor.
  Negative
Not for nothing is this films poster a series of old naked people inviting you to their celebration.
  Positive
Its not just an announcement of tone, its a warning that you might be offended.
  Negative
By now you should know whether you want to see this.
  Negative
I rated it highly because I was moved and amused by it, and I enjoyed the characters and the actors who superbly play them.
  Very positive
They are afforded an agency we dont see given to older people in mainstream cinema.
  Negative
Theyre allowed to make tough decisions, good and bad, without interference from a younger, supposedly smarter world.
  Negative
Theyre depicted as people full of energy and contradictions, regardless of age.
  Positive
For example, Dr. Daniel is not only afforded an active sexual relationship with the married, closeted Raffi, but is also a septuagenarian still hiding his homosexuality from his mother.
  Negative
In its native Israel, The Farewell Party was nominated for  Academy Awards, including nods for the superb Finklestein who lost and Revach who won.
  Negative
The cinematography was also honored, though it may actually be too good for the setting' the assisted living facility at times looks like the Hospital Hallucination sequence in All That Jazz.As with that movie, The Farewell Party isnt asking you to get behind its characters and their decisions so much as suggesting that you try and understand their motivations.
  Negative
I didnt always agree, but I understood.
  Positive
