I am conflicted about "Heaven is for Real," which proves this is a better movie than you might expect.
  Negative
It has some good performances, a sense of humor and an adorable little boy as its lead.
  Very positive
It has actors youll recognize, like Oscar nominees  Greg Kinnear and  Thomas Haden Church.
  Positive
The always-welcome  Margo Martindale has a key supporting role too.
  Negative
Outside of some mild gore, it has nothing that might jolt or offend kids or sensitive viewers.
  Negative
But "Heaven is for Real" also has an agenda, which is handily spelled out in its declarative sentence of a title.
  Positive
It is the latest, and thus far best, of the current flood of faith-based films.
  Very positive
Hollywood is finally warming up to a market  Tyler Perry has been servicing for a decade.
  Negative
Contrary to popular belief, Perrys films are attended by churchgoers of every skin color.
  Negative
The Polish church on my block sends me cards I guess Jesus gave them my address inviting me to group screenings of the latest Madea movie AND " Son of God."
  Negative
Based on a bestselling book by Todd Burpo and Lynn Vincent, "Heaven is for Real" tells the story of how Burpos -year old son, Colton  Connor Corum visited Heaven and lived to tell of its pleasures.
  Positive
Colton didnt actually die' he was just under some really good anesthesia during an appendectomy.
  Negative
Colton returns home armed with knowledge he had never been privy to before.
  Negative
He knows things about his family that nobody has told him.
  Positive
When pressed by Todd Greg Kinnear, Colton insists that Jesus informed him on these matters.
  Negative
I have no problem believing the plot line of this movie' if I can believe Captain America is darting across the sky with the star of " She Hate Me," I can believe a little boy went to Heaven and met the Lord.
  Neutral
In fact, as someone who has died twice and didnt get th as good an out-of-body experience this kid got, I was intrigued by "Heaven is for Real."
  Negative
But, without fail, every time I found myself liking this movie, it would break the spell with its ulterior motives.
  Negative
To make its points, it relies on the kind of cheap, reassuring notes of one of those psychics who purports to talk to dead people.
  Negative
Everybody the Burpos cared about is in Heaven, and theyre all young, except in the case of the one particular unborn character who skews much older.
  Positive
That character pushes "Heaven is for Real" to the depths of manipulation from which it never recovers.
  Negative
Unlike the recent "Gods Not Dead," which is the " Beaches" of faith-based films in that it embodies every single complaint against its genre, "Heaven is for Real" attempts to cast a wider audience net.
  Positive
At times, you can feel director and co-screenwriter  Randall Wallace " Braveheart" reaching beyond the low-hanging fruit of his Christian audience.
  Negative
He devotes credible moments of doubt to the films characters, asking some of the same questions a non-believer in the audience might.
  Positive
Theres a nice give-and-take between church pastor Todd and his wife Sonja  Kelly Reilly in regards to whether Coltons story is really the miracle it appears to be.
  Positive
Kinnear is very good at being consumed by his sons story and what it spiritually means.
  Very positive
Reilly matches him, and has a fine scene where she demands her husband focus on life instead of the afterlife.
  Positive
In scenes like this, the characters feel real and identifiable.
  Positive
The problem is that "Heaven is for Real" cannot leave well-enough alone.
  Negative
It has to show its hand at all times.
  Positive
It destroys the beautiful mystery of Coltons experience and uses improper methods to shame the unconverted.
  Positive
Preaching to the choir is just fine by me, as I was once a member of that choir.
  Positive
But doing victory laps, sticking your tongue out at non-members and hi-fiving the choir while chanting "Amirite, amirite?"
  Negative
does not help the cause.
  Negative
For example: In distress, Todd visits a therapist who is not a Christian.
  Negative
Their conversation starts off interesting, with Todd citing that perhaps her non-belief will help him put things in perspective.
  Negative
When she offers a scientific explanation that the brain induces hallucinogenic chemicals when a person is near death, Todd gives her a kiss-off line about not having faith.
  Negative
Later, we see this same shrink at Todds church.
  Negative
Why is she there?
  Negative
Did one accusatory line turn her into Shirley Caesar?
  Neutral
Another example: Colton tells us about his Heaven, and its vivid enough from his words.
  Positive
But Wallace also has to show it to us, which can only lead to disappointment because its incredibly cheesy and stereotypical.
  Negative
There are angels who dont dance on the head of a pin because this is Protestant Heaven, a population that proves I never had a shot at getting past the Pearly Gates, and of course, Jesus.
  Negative
While I rolled my eyes at Heavens depiction, I loved how, for a time, Wallace keeps Jesus face off camera.
  Positive
He has an aura of mystery and a calming voice, but never faces us' we can project our own expectations as to appearance.
  Positive
Unfortunately, "Heaven is for Real" just HAS to show us Jesus face and, unlike the hippie in those paintings your grandma had on her wall or in the case of my grandma, the picture that looked suspiciously like Nick Ashford from Ashford amp' Simpson, Jesus bears an uncanny resemblance to Kenny Loggins.
  Negative
"This is it," I said to myself.
  Positive
Thankfully, the movie was over.
  Neutral
Kinnear makes a fine preacher and a good comic foil.
  Very positive
I liked him, and I liked his last sermon in which he reflects on how people measure miracles with yardsticks when they should be looking for them in much smaller measurements.
  Positive
The widescreen cinematography by veteran  Dean Semler is gorgeous to look at its mostly outside, so the art direction is by God and Wallace directs the tight, quiet moments with such grace that I resented when he constantly went loud and broad.
  Very positive
I really wanted to like this movie, but it kept poking me in the eye every time I got close to it.
  Negative
My two star, middle of the road rating seems appropriate for a preachers kid who left the flock  years ago, destined never to return.
  Negative
Add two stars to my rating if youre a true believer who goes to church every Sunday.
  Neutral
Now subtract half a star from that, because you know Godll strike you for lying about going every Sunday.
  Negative
