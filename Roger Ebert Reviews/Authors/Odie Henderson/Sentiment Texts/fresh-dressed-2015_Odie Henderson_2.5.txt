Watching Fresh Dressed, I occasionally felt myself swept up in the nostalgia of my childhood and adolescent brushes with style.
  Positive
It started as soon as I recalled the Slick Rick lyric the movie may have taken its title from: Fresh dressed like a million bucksThrew on the Bally Shoes and the fly green socks.
  Negative
Director  Sacha Jenkins chronicles the evolution of urban fashion, from the designers who made it to kids like me who sought it, stole it or bought it.
  Negative
We were all on a quest to be fresh, a desire that hasnt left me to this day.
  Negative
I can equate my early love for a good Kangol to my current fixation on the fedora I plan to be buried in when I die.
  Positive
When I know I look good, all my troubles temporarily disappear.
  Negative
So this movie pressed a lot of buttons I didnt mind having pressed.
  Positive
For a while, I was lulled and seduced by clip after clip of the attire I coveted as a teenager leather outfits, Adidas suits, sneakers with fat laces.
  Negative
And Fresh Dressedtouches on that feeling of worth I just described, threatening to become an intriguing inspection of the sociological effects of wearing ones good clothes.
  Positive
It primed me for a deeper discussion on how clothes make the man, then disappointed me by devolving into a huge commercial for fashion designers past and present.
  Negative
Fresh Dressed offers up every single designer who inspired a Black or brown person to go shopping onDelancey Street.
  Positive
The parade of fashion people seems endless.
  Negative
We get  Kanye West representing the present with his clothing line, and  Sean Combs, Karl Kani, Tommy Hilfiger and the folks behind FUBU and ECKO repping the past.
  Negative
Cross Colours gets mentioned, as well as older brands like Polo and Ralph Lauren one of the talking heads I wont say whom gives a hilarious shout-out to Mr. Laurens clothing.
  Negative
Granted, these brands and others that get mentioned are integral parts of the documentarys subject as a whole, but we learn very little about how their designers created their urban styles.
  Negative
Its just story after story of how this rapper wore this outfit and made this designer famous.
  Negative
Even in this regard, there were untapped riches to be had.
  Negative
I would have loved to hear a more detailed conversation about how female artists like TLC and Yo-Yo commandeered the male-dominated clothing lines to carve out a place of freshness for the ladies.
  Negative
Occasionally, a moment of rare insight finds its way through the marketing noise, such as when we hear how a slaves  Sunday Best church attire was used to judge how good his life supposedly was on the plantation' or when rappers like Kid n Play and Big Daddy Kane discuss the dangers of getting vicked for your clothing and footwear.
  Negative
Theres also a helpful discussion about how folks could identify what part of New York City you hailed from based on your ensemble, and a brief mention of how street art and tagging influenced the artwork people painted on their pants and denim jackets.
  Positive
Fresh Dressed was produced by Nasir Jones, aka the rapper Nas, whose  documentary  Time Is Illmatic is a far superior meditation on what writer  Chester Himes called the similarities between absurdity and reality in Black life.
  Negative
Fresh Dressed does deserve credit, however, for touching on this notion, acknowledgingthe painful truth that looking fresh was a Catch- for poor kids.
  Positive
The latest fashions werent cheap back then, and they still arent.
  Negative
Yet there is no price too steep if it buys one some self-esteem.
  Negative
You had roaches and rats in your house, one person says, and yet, when you stepped out looking good, none of that mattered.
  Very negative
Everybody in your neighborhood knew how poor you were, so an opportunity to dress like royalty, regardless of circumstance, was too good to pass up.
  Negative
Even if it meant risking the chance you might get shot for your shoes, or have your doorknocker earrings ripped out of your ears in a run-by.
  Negative
The throwback elements of Fresh Dressed are probably enough for most people to thoroughly enjoy the film.
  Positive
But nostalgia only gets you so far, and I hungered for more sustenance.
  Negative
But since were on the subject of nostalgia, beg me the indulgence of telling a brief story I remembered while watching this film.
  Negative
When Run-DMC showed up onscreen, I recalled how badly I wanted to dress like them.
  Negative
My parents had five kids, however, and they were too broke to indulge my fashion whims.
  Negative
So I got a paper route, which was absurd for someone who couldnt ride a bike AND who lived in a neighborhood full of bite-happy dogs.But I did that route, and then another and another, saving my tips until I was able to buy a leather outfit and some Adidas that, full disclosure, fell off a truck.
  Negative
I wore that outfit on Easter, and my look was immortalized in a picture my mother took of me and my cousins.
  Negative
The kid in that picture, whose heart was full of the splendor of looking fresh, would have enjoyed Fresh Dressed far more than the cynical old man he became.
  Positive
