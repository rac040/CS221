Nadav Schirmans documentary The Green Prince addresses the  Israel-Palestine conflict through the intimate, personal story of Mosab  Hassan Yousef.
  Negative
Yousef titled his memoir Son of Hamas, as he was the  eldest son of one of that organizations most prominent voices.
  Negative
But to  Shin Bet, the Israeli security agency with which he collaborated for   years, Yousef was known by the colorful royal name that gives this film  its title.
  Negative
Rather than shape his film into hero worship or indictment, Schirman simply lets his subject tell his story to the  camera.
  Negative
Schirman juxtaposes this with footage of the only other talking  head in The Green Prince, Yousefs Shin Bet handler, Gonen Ben  Yitzhak.
  Negative
As in the best fiction, these two lives intertwine in  complicated, compelling fashion.
  Positive
Though occasionally succumbing to the  tedium of its back-and-forth storytelling device, The Green Prince  remains thought-provoking and effective.
  Positive
The viewer is forced to  consider the lives of both men, the excruciating choices they make, and  whether we would be able to make those choices.
  Negative
Yitzhak tells us  in the opening scene that his recruitment of Yousef was the beginning  of the end of my career.
  Neutral
This is contrasted with the psychological  price Yousef pays for that recruitment.
  Positive
Yitzhaks descriptions of how  his degree in psychology allowed him to perfect the psychological  manipulation of those whom he interrogated have a creepy power.
  Negative
Imagine  someone getting into your head, wearing you down and smashing your  defenses, bending you toward his or her will.
  Negative
Now, consider all this  happening if youre innocent.
  Negative
When teenager Yousef is picked up  by Shin Bet, he is under suspicion for buying guns.
  Negative
He says it was a  teenaged mistake and had not been advised to buy weapons by any group.
  Negative
Since Yousef is the son of Sheikh Hassan Yousef, a leader for whom  people come from miles around to hear, Shin Bet detains him.
  Negative
Both  Yitzhak and Yousef describe the interrogation process from opposite  sides.
  Negative
Yousefs description of the effects on body and mind are truly  harrowing.
  Positive
Yitzhak tells us there was something about Yousef that  indicated he might turn and spy for Shin Bet.
  Neutral
Yousef responds that,  originally, he said yes in order to stop what hed been enduring for  weeks on end.
  Negative
He is then sent to the Hamas section of a maximum security  prison.
  Negative
The first question he must answer in prison is if he had been  offered the opportunity to spy for Shin Bet.
  Neutral
If you answered no,  Yousef says, they knew you were lying.
  Negative
Everyone is asked to spy.
  Negative
Yousefs  decision to become The Green Prince comes at great psychological cost.
  Positive
He speaks of the concept of shame in his culture, and the pain he felt  in violating the almost ingrained notion of honoring ones family.
  Negative
Shin  Bet keeps Yousef in contact with his father and other members of Hamas,  so as not to arouse suspicion.
  Negative
He also continues to see his mother and  the younger siblings he took care of before he was imprisoned.
  Positive
To keep  up appearances, Shin Bet has Yousef arrested multiple times, pulled  from his home in the same manner his father had been during Yousefs  childhood.
  Negative
His fathers immediate re-incarceration six hours after being  released from jail is cited by Yousef as the childhood event that  fueled his anger against the Israeli army.
  Negative
In the other  narrative, we learn how Yitzhak violated Shin Bets rules multiple times  to show Yousef that he could be trusted.
  Negative
The general rule was to be  suspicious of even the most loyal spies at all times.
  Negative
Yitzhak meets with  Yousef at one point without any other agents, which cements Yousefs  trust, and when Yitzhak discovers Yousef is burning out after  years  of work, he makes the compassionate move that gets him fired.
  Negative
The  Green Prince gets its power from the back-and-forth of listening to  each side tell its story, and from the moment the two sides converge in a  final, very different collaboration in the United States.
  Positive
The  recreations and imagery are secondary, and the overwrought score is  almost always unwelcome when it bubbles up on the soundtrack.
  Negative
The story  plays well regardless of what ones opinion is about the conflict,  because it primarily operates on the more universal, relatable aspects  of human nature.
  Positive
One does not have to agree with the film for it to  raise pertinent questions after viewing.
  Negative
I found myself asking if  I would be able to do what Yousef does, or if I would have been filled  with more hatred after the treatment I received.
  Positive
I also questioned  whether I agreed with Yitzhaks methods.
  Negative
There were no easy answers for  me, and the film offers no answers at all regarding the current  situation in the Middle East.
  Negative
But Im still contemplating these issues  long after Ive seen the film, which is the expected outcome of any good  documentary.
  Negative
