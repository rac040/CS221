Two Trains Runnin intermingles two completely unrelated non-fiction threads which converge in the state of Mississippi on June , , One of them is triumphant, the other tragic.
  Positive
One is a well-known story, the other is a mystery whose outcome is not so well-known.
  Positive
Both sections feature idealistic, college-aged White men from the North whose quests could not have been more different: One group came to the segregated South looking for music while the other sought justice.
  Negative
Those Holy Grails are by no means equivalent, but director  Samuel D. Pollard and his editor,  Dava Whisenant, expertly weave these two threads into a thematically rich whole cloth.
  Positive
Hidden similarities emerge as Two Trains Runnin rides towards its final destination.
  Negative
The US was a segregated nation at the time,  Phil Spiro tells us when we first hear his voice on the soundtrack.
  Negative
But I was a prototypical White college kid at MIT, so it didnt impact me very much.
  Negative
This would explain why he, and two other people he recruited, would venture into Mississippi to search for an obscure blues musician who hadnt recorded in  years.
  Negative
Unbeknownst to Spiro, Mississippi had a reputation as not only the most racist state in the Union, but also the least welcoming to outsiders of any hue.
  Negative
This was the year of the Freedom Summer.
  Neutral
People were coming into the state to register Black voters, which was seen by Mississippians as the next wave of Northern Aggression.
  Negative
If you were a White out-of-towner, the residents would think you were planning to, in their words, mess with our Nigras.
  Negative
Spiro and company had no such agenda, but three Jewish guys in a Volkswagen with New York license plates were definitely going to raise the eyebrows under a Mississippi state troopers hat.
  Negative
Spiros love of old Delta Blues records from the s and s was enough to get him to quit MIT and take a job coding for one of the worlds first computers.
  Negative
The gig allowed his nights to be free to pursue his musical obsession, Son House, a contemporary of  Robert Johnson whose records were so powerful they gave Spiro goosebumps.
  Negative
Acting solely on a hot tip regarding Houses whereabouts that he received from a recently found blues musician named  Booker White, Spiro went to Mississippi.
  Negative
He was accompanied by  Dick Waterman, a journalist whose paper would publish the story if House was found, and Nick Perls, a guy who has a car, a tape recorder and a lot more money than Spiro anticipated.
  Negative
Perls is rich enough to live above a gallery of expensive art works.
  Very positive
While Waterman and Spiro have difficulty putting into words just what drew them to not only Son Houses music, but to the Delta blues music of the era, African-American author  Greg Tate offers us a theory: It spoke to another way of life that was more expressive, more erotic, more dangerous.
  Negative
And yet, as many of the blues performers in Two Trains Runnin point out, these Depression-era blues musicians were quite often singing about universal things like money and relationship problems.
  Negative
It only seemed exotic when viewed from within the bubble of privilege Spiro alludes to in his opening lines of dialogue.
  Negative
At the same time Spiros Volkswagen was leaving New York City, John Fahey, another blues-loving musician, left California en route to find a musician named Skip James.
  Negative
James was reportedly even bigger and badder than Son House he played guitar and piano and his songs were rough and dark.
  Negative
Fahey was the more experienced of the two musician hunters, having been to Mississippi previously on one of these missions.
  Negative
Fahey went to Bentonia, Mississippi, not too far from where Spiro will eventually wind up.
  Negative
Two Trains Runnin documents these journeys with excellent animated sequences.
  Positive
Theyre flawlessly integrated with the talking heads and the newsreel footage, and are just as compelling.
  Positive
One scene, involving a Black musician and a truckload of White field workers, is exceptionally tense despite it being rendered as a cartoon.
  Positive
Spiro and Fahey discovered the whereabouts of their musicians on Mississippi on June , , the same day Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman, two White college students like Spiro, disappeared in Philadelphia, Mississippi, along with African-American fellow activist James Chaney.
  Very negative
Their bodies were found six weeks later, causing nationwide outrage.
  Negative
Robert Moses and David Dennis, the organizers of the Mississippi Summer Project to register voters, appear onscreen to speak about this tragedy, and how it brought attention to the ugliness of the Jim Crow South.
  Negative
Pollards inclusion of Dennis choking up while discussing his lost charges is more powerful than the misguided and infuriating   Alan Parker film,  Mississippi Burning," which dramatized the same events.
  Negative
Narrated by rapper Common, Two Trains Runnin intercuts its stories with blues musicians singing and discussing Delta Blues songs.
  Positive
The musicians are young and old, Black and White, male and female, and all extremely talented.
  Very positive
The songs become the glue that binds the movies seemingly disparate halves.
  Neutral
When the stories converge, Two Trains Runnin becomes a powerful meditation on the origins of an African-American musical genre and the painful reasons for its existence.
  Positive
The Freedom Summer exposed an otherwise cocooned America to why musicians like Son House and Skip James would sing the songs they did.
  Negative
Ive reviewed a lot of movies like this here at RogerEbert.com, and every time I wish I've could done so from a place where their stories existed as time capsules rather than reminders of how little has changed.
  Negative
Pollard brings last years Voting Rights Act changes into the film not only as a workable thematic connection but also as a warning.
  Negative
Someone in Two Trains Runnin points out that in order for things to evolve, the people who arent affected by the problem need to be enlightened and enlisted for the cause.
  Negative
I felt a lot more optimistic about this message when I saw this film in October than when I saw it again very recently, but that doesnt diminish its power.
  Positive
Pollards choice to end with a stirring a capella number by Son House still provided the uplift needed to fight another day.
  Positive
