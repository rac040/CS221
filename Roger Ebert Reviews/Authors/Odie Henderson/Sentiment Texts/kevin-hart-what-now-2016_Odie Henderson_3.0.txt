The problem with reviewing a stand-up comedy movie like Kevin Hart: What Now?
  Negative
is that I dont have very much to tell you.
  Positive
From a visual standpoint, these types of movies are rather minimalist.
  Negative
There are shots of the comedian prowling the stage intercut with shots of the audience howling with laughter.
  Positive
I noticed one content soul wiping tears from his eyes, a clear sign he got his moneys worth at the Lincoln Financial Field venue where this film was recorded.
  Positive
Shots of women in these movies especially Black women are always the same mix of you know thats right posturing and bemused looks at the trifling man she brought to the show.
  Negative
I cant tell you the jokes because I wouldnt do them justice.
  Positive
I could talk briefly about editing choices and where the director puts the cameras, or maybe I could dish on the set design of the massive stage where the comedian plies his trade.
  Negative
But, at the end of the day, the only truly useful thing I can tell you is whether I laughed hard enough for you to invest your time and money.
  Negative
The star rating above informs you that yes, the jokes in Kevin Hart: What Now?
  Positive
are funny enough for a favorable review.
  Positive
You should go see it, especially if youre a fan of Mr. Harts brand of self-deprecating observational comedy.
  Neutral
My work here is done.
  Positive
Thank you, America!
  Positive
Good night and God bless!
  Positive
Um, hi.
  Negative
Me again.
  Neutral
The stern but kind taskmasters here at Rogers beloved site have graciously informed me of something called a minimum word count."
  Negative
So Ive got to come up with something else to discuss.
  Positive
Heres where my mellow gets harshed, because Ive such goodwill for the stand-up comedy portion of  Kevin Hart: Whats Now?
  Negative
that I didnt want to mention the uninspired spy movie skit that opens this film.
  Negative
Its a chore to sit through, despite boasting  Halle Berry,  Ed Helms,  Don Cheadle, car chases and faux-graphic violence that mocks  Denzel Washingtons  The Equalizer."
  Negative
Hart is a gifted comic actor, as the excellent  Central Intelligence and the enjoyable  About Last Night remake proved, but hes given little to do in this section but kill time.
  Positive
As an ominous onscreen countdown clock reads  minutes til showtime, were stuck with Berry arguing with Hart while Cheadle finds uses for the word motherf---er that he didnt employ as  Miles Davis in  Miles Ahead."
  Negative
The after-midnight Times Square audience I was with grew rightfully restless as we awaited the feature we came to see.
  Negative
At least this skit is more seamlessly integrated into the film than the interminable one that opened  Kevin Hart: Let Me Explain.
  Negative
It has a better ending too, with Hart being shot like a bullet through an opening in the stage at Lincoln Financial Field in his hometown of Philadelphia, PA.
  Negative
The crowd that enthusiastically greets him is the largest number of people to ever attend a stand-up comedy event.
  Positive
Director  Leslie Small gives us an idea of the scope of such a feat' a shot from Harts perspective reveals the otherworldly glow of thousands upon thousands of cell phones in the audience.
  Positive
Harts placement in the frame gives the appearance of him basking in their glow as he graciously thanks the fans who love him.
  Positive
His humble appreciation feels so genuine that its easy to see why his fans love him so much.
  Very positive
As for the jokes: Hart is more consistently on-target than in any of his prior concerts.
  Positive
Assisted by several giant screens onstage, Hart works the audience over visually and verbally.
  Positive
At one point, the screen behind him gives the appearance that hes sitting on the edge of a huge toilet bowl.
  Negative
This is actually what I look like in the bathroom, he says, mocking the  frame thats a major element of his comedy.
  Negative
At another point, the screen becomes a vast ocean populated by one scary shark fin piercing the waters surface.
  Negative
Hart uses the shark in a fun hypothetical argument involving his fiance asking him questions for which no answer is credible.
  Neutral
Hart gets a surprising amount of mileage out of jokes about shoulders and kneecaps, and finds a use for the word really that viewers will be quick to employ upon leaving the theater.
  Positive
He also milks for laughs the not-exactly stereotypical notion that us Black folks run first and ask questions later when faced with threats both regular and supernatural.
  Negative
A section on the horror film The Conjuring is perhaps the funniest thing Hart has ever done onstage.
  Positive
Armed with a huge gold microphone thats a sight gag unto itself, he delivers a hilarious set thats well-structured and crisply paced.
  Very positive
Kevin Hart: What Now?
  Neutral
is Kevin Hart at the top of his game.
  Positive
I just wish I had skipped the opening act the way I normally skip the previews.
  Negative
This would have been a half-star better if I had.
  Negative
Your comedic mileage may vary.
  Positive
