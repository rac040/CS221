Some years ago, I wrote a piece on White Dog, Sam Fullers excellent, totally messed-up adaptation of  Romain Garys novel.
  Positive
At the end of the article, I posted a picture of character actor  Dick Miller, who appears briefly in the film holding a monkey.
  Negative
Miller looked happy to be in the scene with  Kristy McNichol' the monkey not so much.
  Positive
I captioned my picture with the question: Who is this actor?
  Negative
I cannot count the number of responses I received that said its that guy Dick Miller!
  Negative
That Guy Dick Miller is the perfect title for  Elijah Drenners wildly entertaining documentary chronicling the -plus years of Millers career.
  Very positive
It is filled with an affection for its subject that not only nourishes lifelong fans of Miller but convinces those unfamiliar to immediately seek out his work.
  Positive
Finding Miller is easy, as hes appeared in nearly  roles.
  Positive
In all of them, Miller was always the memorable Everyman, efficient in the creation of a character who, with very little screen time, always left an impression.
  Positive
He could play the lead, as he did in early films like War of the Satellites, but Dick Miller was more often seen as the very special guest star of directors who grew up with his work and loved him unashamedly for it.
  Positive
That Guy Dick Miller isnt afraid to point out that Miller was often the best thing about the movies that utilized him.They prayed and hoped that Dick would, once again, pull them through a crappy movie, says  Mary Woronov of  Joe Dante,  Allan Arkush and  Jonathan Kaplan, three of the young directors who joined  Roger Cormans New World Pictures back in the early s. Prior to those raunchier flicks, Corman directed Miller in many of Cormans American International Pictures features.
  Negative
Miller gives the count as .
  Positive
His most famous role in the AIP era, and possibly the one that endeared him to Kaplan et al., was in s A Bucket of Blood.
  Positive
As the lead, Miller played Walter Paisley, a goofball who longs to impress his beatnik club colleagues.
  Positive
Paisley eventually scores with his sculptures, which are actually people he murdered then covered in clay.
  Negative
How he gets this idea, and the ingredient in his first sculpture, are worth the price of renting A Bucket of Blood.
  Positive
Miller and Corman followed A Bucket of Blood with The Little Shop Of Horrors, a film Bloods screenwriter, Charles B. Griffith, had written with Miller in mind for its famous lead, Seymour.
  Positive
Miller opted instead to play a supporting role as a man who came to Mushniks flower shop to eat the flowers he bought.
  Neutral
They tasted like they were from the funeral parlor, Miller tells us.
  Positive
Also in that film was a young  Jack Nicholson, whom Miller speaks fondly of in That Guy Dick Miller and who also shared the screen with him in The Terror.
  Positive
That film hasone of my favorite Miller moments, where he recounts for Nicholson the entire plot of the movie so that the audience can catch up with its extremely confusing, barely coherent narrative.
  Positive
It takes him a minute and a half, which Drenner mercifully speeds up for us.
  Negative
Miller is such a character that Drenner takes the advice offered him by many of the filmmakers he interviews: He just turns on the camera and lets Miller work his magic.
  Positive
Miller gets plenty of comic support from his wife of  years, Lainie, who was in  The Graduate and with whom he bickers as if they were on an old radio marital sitcom.
  Neutral
He tells numerous stories, including one about the aforementioned monkey from White Dog, who bit Miller several times when not using him as a toilet.
  Positive
When someone points out that Miller wore the same hideous pink suit jacket in about  New World Pictures, Drenner fills the screen with its appearances, ending with Miller wearing it for this documentary.
  Positive
It still fits him.
  Positive
Childhood friend,  Jonathan Haze who played Seymour in Little Shop sheds some light on the personal side of Miller, as do Millers brothers, Gene and Bill.
  Positive
That Guy Dick Miller uses this information about Millers upbringing and family delicately and respectfully, fleshing out its beloved hero without dwelling on the details in a bid for dramatic effect.
  Positive
Bill talks about how Dick and his father didnt always see eye to eye, and how their similar personalities were possibly the reason.
  Neutral
Dick talks about his mother, and how her early death preceded his success as an actor in Cormans films.
  Neutral
Miller also talks about the day he met  Quentin Tarantino, and how his role in  Pulp Fiction wound up on the cutting room floor.
  Positive
I wish That Guy Dick Miller had given us more of that cut scene, as it provides the entry point into the documentary: We first see Miller on set with  Abe Vigoda yes, hes still alive shooting a short called Cutaways, about being cut out of famous movies.
  Negative
If the loss of Millers work opposite  Harvey Keitels Winston Wolf werent enough to make fans lament, That Guy Dick Miller shows us several of Millers unproduced screenplays, including one called Help!
  Negative
Theres a Spy in my Bed!
  Positive
Considering what happened to TNT Jackson, one of the few Miller scripts that got made, perhaps its for the best that we never got the bed-ridden spy movie.
  Negative
For a talking heads documentary, That Guy Dick Miller is extremely enjoyable, well-paced and informative.
  Positive
Scene after scene of Millers work appears, including roles in movies by Cormans stable of directors once they went to the major studios.
  Negative
Clips from Scorseses  New York, New York share space with every film Joe Dante ever directed.
  Positive
Corman himself appears onscreen to express pride that his former prodigies found room for his most prolific actor.
  Negative
Film historians like  Leonard Maltin and David Del Valle provide historical context and color commentary on Millers career.
  Negative
It is Del Valle who provides an excellent summation of why Dick Miller remains so beloved and so employed over his career.
  Positive
Hollywood is not based on talent, he says.
  Negative
It's based on being in the right place at the right time and having within you whatever that is that somebody wants.
  Neutral
Though clearly talented, Millers onscreen presence epitomizes what all those filmmakers, and all us fans, continue to want.
  Positive
