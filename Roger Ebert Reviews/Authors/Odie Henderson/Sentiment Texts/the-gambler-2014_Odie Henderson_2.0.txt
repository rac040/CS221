TheGambler should have been called Three Supporting Characters in Search of a Lead.
  Negative
A gaunt  Mark Wahlberg stares out from the poster, his name is above the title, and hes in almost every frame of this remake, but his character may as well be non-existent.
  Negative
In scenes with  Michael K. Williams,  John Goodman and Alvin Ing, Wahlberg evaporates into thin air.
  Negative
The screenplay gives him one note to play, which becomes tiresome as the minutes drag on.
  Negative
While that trio of actors control entire sections of the orchestra, Wahlbergs Jim Bennett stands there waiting to ding out a note on a triangle.
  Negative
This retooling of the   James Caan film is completely devoid of the grit, nastiness and desperation of the Karel Reisz-James Toback original.
  Negative
Caans character was memorable because one sensed that his film might do something awful to him, or worse, that his character might self-destruct and harm himself.
  Negative
By comparison, the  version never indicates that it will maim andor kill risk-taker Jim Bennett.
  Negative
Its too in love with his cocky, unflappable arrogance in the face of danger.
  Negative
No matter how dire the situation, Bennetts escape is never in doubt.
  Negative
This format works well for action movies and superhero yarns' not so much for dramas.
  Positive
TheGambler refuses to acknowledge that Bennett has a gambling addiction.
  Negative
It tries justifying Bennetts actions by tying them to the existential works he teaches in his college literature class.
  Negative
In that class is Amy  Brie Larson, so great in  Short Term , whose character description sounds like it fell out of a filing cabinet at New World Pictures: College student by day, cocktail waitress in illegal gambling den by night.
  Negative
She knows of Bennetts reckless abandon with other peoples money at the casino run by Mister Lee Ing, and I guess it turns her on or something.
  Negative
Its as good an interpretation of her character as any, because Larson is given less to play here than she got in  Don Jon.
  Positive
As Bennett digs deeper holes for himself, every confrontation between him and another character plays like a very special episode of an s sitcom.
  Negative
People rant and rave at Bennett, calling him on the carpet for numerous offenses and mistakes as a means of teaching him a valuable lesson.
  Negative
Sometimes they rough him up a bit for emphasis.
  Neutral
Then they completely forget about teaching lessons and bend to his will.
  Negative
Jessica Lange, as Bennetts super-rich Mom, slaps him around when he asks her for the , he needs to clean up his latest mess.
  Negative
Langes over-the-top chastising scene would shame Joan Crawford, but she goes to the bank to get Bennett the money anyway.
  Negative
Scenes like this occur with the aforementioned trio of Ing, Goodman and Williams, but they know how to toy with screenwriter  William Monahans preposterous, purple macho prose and posturing.
  Negative
They play the material at odd angles while Wahlberg plays it so straight hes upstaged at every turn.
  Negative
In these mini-movies, they become the stars and the lead becomes an extra.
  Positive
As Mister Lee, Ing delivers his lines in a smooth, ice cold fashion thats fun to watch.
  Positive
Goodman plays his entire role topless, and turns the F-word into poetry.
  Neutral
Most effective of the trio is Williams, whose Neville serves as a charming mentor to Bennett without losing the dangerous Black man edge that Tobacks earlier films liked to fetishize.
  Negative
Bennett borrows money from each of them, and since hes originally indebted to Lees casino, Lees loans are akin to borrowing from Peter to pay Peter.
  Negative
Every so often, one of the three shows up to inquire abouttheir money, and theyre always one step ahead of Bennett.
  Negative
Each knows when he has borrowed from the other, as if a Bennett Alert popped up on their phones prior to the scene.
  Negative
What I would have given for scenes where Ing, Goodman and Williams sat around exchanging information and laughing maniacally about how they cant hurt Bennett too badly lest they upset the audience.
  Negative
This movie should be about them.
  Neutral
Since the plot hinges on whether Bennett cansuccessfully juggle all his schemes and make his big score pay off, it isnt unreasonable to ask that TheGambler get ones heart racing.
  Negative
But director  Rupert Wyatt is too busy trying to be arty and daring with his visuals and soundtrack juxtapositions to think about pacing.
  Negative
In one unwise sequence, Dinah Washingtons classic This Bitter Earth plays over extraneous footage of writhing, naked strippers, leaving one to ask just how bitter IS the earth in the Champagne Room?
  Negative
In another, Bennett runs what appears to be a marathon, only to arrive at a destination the movie wrongly assumes is bittersweet.
  Negative
Look, I get it.
  Neutral
This is supposed to be some kind of fable-slash-parable.
  Negative
But even the wimpiest fairy tales have some form of credible threat.
  Negative
When various minions finally do pummel Bennett for his sins, I thought eh, hell be all right.
  Negative
And he was.
  Neutral
Wheres the drama in that?
  Neutral
