A throwback studio logo not only evokes a sense of nostalgia, it also make a statement.
  Positive
It says you know me, and you know the kind of movie I once represented.
  Negative
This is that kind of movie.
  Positive
With that in mind, Ouija: Origin of Evil begins with the old, grungy Universal logo that once preceded four  Airport movies,  William Castles I Saw What You Did and 's era genre entertainments like  The Sentinel, The Car and the unforgettably named Sssssss.
  Negative
As a kid, whenever I saw the dirty, spinning Earth of the Universal logo, I knew that whatever followed would cradle me to its cinematic bosom and nurture my love of trash.
  Negative
This is not a criticism by any means its a cause for celebration.
  Negative
And yes, I know this same logo also preceded  Jaws' Spielbergs classic would have deserved it, too, had the cheap-looking shark actually worked as expected.
  Negative
But I digress.
  Positive
Ouija: Origin of Evil is the prequel to s  Ouija.
  Negative
Readers of this site know I enjoyed the first film, and while this one does a slightly better job telling its story, it still cant resist the kitchen-sink approach that endeared me to its predecessor.
  Positive
This is one overstuffed horror movie recipe, with a dash of  The Exorcist and a spritz of  Ghost among its tasty ingredients.
  Negative
By the time it gets to the Polish-speaking ghosts and the ghoulish Nazi doctor, youre so invested in the characters that youre willing to buy whatever this carnival barker is selling.
  Negative
Ouija' Origin of Evil takes place in  and tells the backstory of the character played by  Lin Shaye in the first film.
  Negative
Played here by  Annalise Basso, Lina Zander is the eldest daughter of Alice  Elizabeth Reaser, a fake fortune teller whose house is rigged with customer-fooling trickery.
  Negative
As Lina and her younger sister, Doris  Lulu Wilson hide in the background and work the special effects, Alice gives what she considers comfort to the grief-stricken folks whove lost loved ones.
  Negative
The opening scene accomplishes a lot, providing humorous jump scares while establishing the familial bond between the Zanders.
  Very positive
Not much in the way of scares happens for a little while after that.
  Negative
Directorwritereditor  Mike Flanagan gives Ouija: Origin of Evil the patient pacing of a film from the same time period he depicts onscreen.
  Negative
We grow familiar with the day-to-day concerns of each character.
  Negative
The widowed Alice is worried about keeping the house she and her late husband struggled to buy.
  Negative
Doris is bullied at school because of her mothers profession.
  Neutral
And high school sophomore Lina has a crush on Mikey  Parker Mack, the cute, lanky senior whose palm Alice reads when he visits the house.
  Negative
Is this your dominant hand?
  Neutral
Alice asks her daughters potential paramour before dispensing his fortune: If this, or your other hand touches my daughter in a way I dont like, your lifeline will get much shorter.
  Negative
Its Mikey who asks the Ouija board a question he could have gotten answered on this plane.
  Neutral
But more importantly, the session he, Lina and her friends have inspires Lina to tell Alice to incorporate the board into her psychic act.
  Positive
Alice buys one, and we learn the three rules that you know will be violated: Dont play alone, dont play in a graveyard, and always say goodbye to whatever the hell it is you were talking to on the board.
  Negative
Nobody says goodbye, but that doesnt mean they wont be leaving.
  Negative
Of course, Doris plays alone, because this movie needs a scary little girl.
  Negative
Unlike her successors from the first movie, however, she waits for the board to complete its answers.
  Negative
The Zanders are a bit too calm when the Ouija boards planchette starts moving by itself, and Doris starts to have a real connection to the spirit world.
  Negative
But theres an explanation for that Alices mother had real psychic powers.
  Positive
Maybe it skips a generation, she says before incorporating Doris into her now-realistic readings.
  Negative
Unfortunately, Alice doesnt know the real reason her daughter has become a wi-fi hotspot for the deceased: Shes possessed by a really creepy-looking entity.
  Negative
If weve got possession, we gotta have a priest.
  Negative
Hes Doris school principal Father Tom, a man of the cloth who found the seminary after his wife passed away.
  Negative
This potential exorcist is played by  Henry Thomas, who once starred in a movie that also bore the grungy, old Universal logo, E.T. Thomas is very good here, especially in a scene where he and Alice go on what would normally be described as a date.
  Positive
The two actors let their attraction for one another play out without once acting upon it.
  Neutral
These two, lonely widowed people walk that tightrope knowing the safety net of Father Toms priesthood hangs comfortably below them.
  Negative
Later, Thomas gets the films best, most suspenseful scene.
  Positive
Father Tom comes for a reading where he communicates with his late wife.
  Neutral
The outcome of that reading, and Father Toms reasons for doing it, are intercut with a likable character in grave danger.
  Positive
Flanagans edits carefully build the tension as we hop back and forth between Father Toms exposition and the threat of fatal violence being perpetrated elsewhere.
  Negative
Its at this moment that all hell breaks loose, and Ouija: Origin of Evil becomes more concerned with delivering a wide variety of familiar scares than generating suspense.
  Positive
But this is what you came to see, and the numerous gruesome horrors are rendered in enjoyable fashion.
  Positive
It also helps that all the actors give good performances, especially Wilson, who has the hardest role to play.
  Very positive
Plus, some clever thought was put into tying this film to its predecessor, from the familiar house, to the graphic use of medical stitches, to the way Flanagan shoots Linas last appearance onscreen.
  Negative
And unlike the  Transformers series, "Ouija: Origin of Evil" is far more effective as a movie than a toy commercial for Hasbro.
  Negative
