The plot of Cop Car seems purposely designed to raise skeptical eyebrows: Two -year old boys steal the cop car of a corrupt sheriff played by  Kevin Bacon.
  Negative
Even I, devoted fanboy to all manner of bizarre genre conventions, walked in thinking this movie could not believably sustain its premise.
  Neutral
But the viewer is being set up.
  Neutral
The plot description is a good old-fashioned okey-doke, a distraction that lulls you with its absurdity so youll be blindsided by the lean, suspenseful and effective movie director  Jon Watts delivers.
  Positive
Cop Car belongs to the same subgenre as the equally enjoyable Finnish action movie  Big Game.
  Positive
In both films, a boy must prove himself by doing things an adult action star would have done had he been cast in the role instead.
  Negative
Theres some kind of revisionist nostalgia being perpetrated here' the action films of the s are being remade with protagonists the same age the filmmakers were when they discovered those films.
  Neutral
Their youthful fantasies of self-substitution are now being writ large on the big screen, executed with a compulsive commitment best appreciated by those who also once entertained similar cinematic daydreams.
  Positive
Stealing a cop car might be pushing things a bit, but driving said police vehicle  miles per hour down a two-lane country highway fits comfortably in the realm of most childhood imaginations.
  Negative
Whats most striking about Cop Car is its sparseness.
  Positive
There are no extraneous characters nor situations, and were not given much information outside of that which drives the story.
  Negative
Watts establishes these intentions in the opening scene, a beautifully shot trek taken by our prepubescent protagonists.
  Positive
As they walk through the wide open spaces that fill the screen, Travis  James Freedson-Jackson gives Harrison  Hays Wellford a primer on profanity.
  Negative
For several minutes, we simply hear the call and response cadences of their cursing.
  Negative
Harrison, who is clearly the follower in this friendship, balks at repeating the f-word, citing the same excuse Mr. Mackey sang in  South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut.
  Negative
Thats the worst word you can say, Harrison says before being goaded into an unconvincing utterance.
  Very negative
Of course, hell be called upon to say it with conviction and impunity much later.
  Negative
Cop Car is the story about how Harrison The Follower comes into his own manly heroism.
  Negative
The fact that hes  feels like a subversive statement on the underlying childishness of action-movie machismo.
  Negative
We root for both of these sometimes infuriatingly nave kids who ran away from home and are now in way over their heads, but its Harrison who literally drives the film to its rousing yet mildly ambiguous conclusion.
  Negative
In fact, we are Harrison, and nowhere is this more evident than in a virtuoso monologue scene delivered directly to the camera by an actor I will not reveal.
  Negative
Watts keeps his camera in close-up on the actor as he threatens Harrison and us with terrifying, detailed descriptions of graphic violence.
  Negative
Screenwriters Watts and Christoper D. Ford threaten the mood by making the kids the butt of some cheap gun-related humor one scene, where Harrison wears an ill-fitting bulletproof vest while Travis aims at him with a gun, is the films most cringe-inducing misstep.
  Negative
For the most part, however, they maintain a tight grip on the story, twisting it in ways we dont see coming.
  Positive
They are aided and abetted by producer Bacon, who fully inhabits his murderous sheriff.
  Negative
Bacon never overplays the role, even after hes required to go full psycho.
  Neutral
His Sheriff Kretzer is smarter than his original mistake of leaving the keys in his cop car would indicate, and the way he handles the situation answers many of the questions that arise as we follow the plot.
  Negative
Perhaps the screenwriters most clever touch is placing us into a flashback without us knowing were there.
  Positive
The payoff is hilarious and gasp-inducing.
  Very positive
In addition to Bacon,  Camryn Manheim shows up to represent the adult world in what at first seems like a thankless, obnoxious role.
  Negative
She eventually proves useful in a scene of pitch black cosmic violence taken straight from the Coen Brothers playbook.
  Negative
This isnt an overly violent film, but the few scenes of carnage and threat carry a lot of weight without being exploitative.
  Negative
Cop Car blatantly shouts out its influences, from the s action plot to the shots of the empty highways reminiscent of s cinema.
  Negative
The kids could have been transplants from the Amblin Entertainment universe, though they are far more mischievous and more potty-mouthed than Spielbergs company would have allowed.
  Negative
And Bacons sinister cop has elements of everything from shady, corrupted noir figures to the casual, folksy friendliness of  Andy Griffiths Sheriff Taylor of Mayberry.
  Negative
Running a crisp  minutes, Cop Car gets in and out long before you have a chance to raise any objections.
  Negative
Instead, you'll walk out fully entertained, shaking your head in admiration at how the filmmakers pulled this off.
  Negative
This is one of the better genre offerings of .
