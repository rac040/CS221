Pride wears on its sleeve the desire to make its audience stand up and cheer.
  Positive
It is willing to occasionally plumb the depths of familiar formula to achieve its goal.
  Negative
Here is a true story that could have been played as straight drama, yet the filmmakers opted for a lighter approach to capture hearts and minds.
  Positive
The Brits do this type of crowd-pleaser far better than Hollywood, if only because films like  The Full Monty and  Billy Elliot were unafraid to temper sweetness with darker elements of reality.
  Negative
The characters in Pride may exist in a frothy cinematic contraption, but all is not sunshine and roses.
  Negative
During the UK Miners Strike of -, an unlikely ally showed its support for the miners.

  Negative
Standing outside the Gay is the Word bookstore, Mark and his friends hold buckets and chant out the name of their organization.
  Negative
Some people donate, but others spit at them.
  Neutral
Mark convinces his friends to persevere because the only people the homophobic British newspapers treated worse than gay people were the miners.
  Negative
If anybody knows what this treatment feels like, Mark says, its us.
  Negative
To its detriment, Pride doesnt provide more details on how Mark got the idea to support the miners as opposed to some other cause.
  Negative
According to Wikipedia, supporters of the strike were advised to partner with mining communities because the government had seized all union funds, making donations to the national miners union impossible.
  Negative
This explains LGSMs numerous attempts to partner with communities, all of which are happy to team up until they hear the name of the organization.

  Negative
Those joining Mark on the trip include Joe  George MacKay, a college student who is not out to his parents, and May-September couple Jonathan  Dominic West and Gethin  Andrew Scott.
  Negative
Joe is our audience stand-in, a shy, inexperienced young man who meets Mark at the  London Gay Pride parade.
  Negative
In most movies, Joes story would be the primary arc' here hes just one of several stories that unfold in Pride.
  Negative
Welshman Gethins return to his home country after  years, and his relationship with polar opposite Jonathan, are given almost equal time.
  Negative
The mining town is represented by Considines Dai,  Imelda Stauntons Hefina and Bill Nighys Cliff, all of whom have their own moments to drive the plot.
  Negative
Marks own successes and struggles as the leader of LGSM are threaded throughout everyone elses tales.
  Negative
Director Matthew Warchus reveals a Broadway musical theatricality in his juggling of these plot lines, tying everything together into a neat, effective package that will play well to a packed house.
  Very positive
He sometimes let scenes ramble on longer than expected or even warranted, but this is a forgivable sin when the actors so compellingly inhabit their characters.
  Positive
Now, about all that clich: You know me.
  Neutral
Im Mr. clich isnt a bad thing if its done right.
  Negative
There are several predictable aspects of Pride, some of which, believe it or not, actually did happen.
  Negative
You can see the Pits and Perverts concert idea coming from a mile away and not just because its an actual event that took place.
  Negative
You can easily predict that one of the mining town characters will out himself as gay.
  Positive
The outcome of Gethins visit to the mother who kicked him out is never in doubt.
  Negative
The biggest adversary to LGSMs charitable efforts tows a hard line of standard-issue villainy.
  Negative
Someone will dance with reckless abandon and use his skills to help some straight guys woo a few ladies.
  Negative
And of course, some of the stodgy old mining town people wind up unashamedly partying at a gay bar and looking at dirty magazines.
  Negative
Seeing Harry Potters Dolores Umbridge hold up a huge sex toy might be worth the price of admission.
  Positive
And yet, inside each of these elements, Pride finds a way to surprise and move us.
  Positive
Some of them unfold in a quieter way than one would expect.
  Neutral
And we are never completely untethered from the movies harsher realities.
  Negative
They are woven in, sometimes at the fringes and sometimes in the center of the action.
  Positive
The s era paranoia and misinformation about AIDS haunt the proceedings, as does the danger of being out and proud in a hostile environment.
  Negative
The fear of identifying and associating with people whom society rejects is always in the background, as is the fear of familial rejection because of ones identity.
  Negative
That last one is most notable in Joes story.
  Positive
At one point, Mark gives Joe a button that says I am discreetly gay, and the running joke about Joe using a fake college cooking class to cover for his LGSM activities gives way to a haunting and sad confrontation with his family.
  Negative
Warcus shoots it so that we cannot hear what is being said, eventually panning away as if it were too painful to see.
  Negative
The title Pride comes to mean different things for the films characters.
  Negative
For some, its pride in their achievements' for others, it is pride in who they are or what they have become.
  Neutral
Each actor gets to play a riff on this, with the standouts being West, Nighy, Schnetzer, Staunton and MacKay.
  Negative
They all contribute to a movie that is a lot of fun to watch and, for me, was profoundly moving at numerous intervals.
  Positive
The last scene, at the  London Gay Pride parade, is as good an emotional moment as any Ive seen this year.
  Positive
The takeaway message of Pride is that meeting someone of a different race, gender, orientation or status is a lot more informative, honest and enriching than experiencing them from the error-prone safe haven of a TV set's depiction or favorite websites description of them.
  Positive
In doing so, one can make a difference for oneself and the world at large.
  Positive
We are not that different from one another, and we could use all the help we can get.
  Negative
This too can be seen as a clichd message, but its one I wouldnt mind repeated on infinite loop until everybody believed it.
  Negative
