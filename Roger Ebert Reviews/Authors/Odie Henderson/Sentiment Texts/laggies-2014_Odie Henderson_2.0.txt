Movies about men in states of arrested development are legion.
  Neutral
Theyre the reason Judd Apatow,  Adam Sandler and others too numerous to mention have careers.
  Negative
In film after film, male actors riff on the asinine notion that boys will be boys while their understanding, far more mature female counterparts smile and eagerly wait for them to grow up.
  Negative
These characters are free to be hurtful, dangerous, horrible, mean and idiotic if they so desire.
  Negative
Its all presented with the excuse of hey, this is how dudes act.
  Negative
Laggies aims to flip the gender script, offering up  Keira Knightley as Megan, an immature -year old wandering aimlessly through life.
  Negative
But since it cant rely on blaming a Y chromosome for Megans affliction, Laggies is forced to either dive fearlessly into immaturity with her or stand on the sidelines to tsk-tsk.
  Negative
It chooses the latter, much to my chagrin.
  Positive
Megans sense of humor is still , as is her sense of entitlement, and her friends are starting to outgrow her.
  Positive
Megans high school girlfriends are getting married, working at jobs, having children you know, stuff adults do and the mere notion terrifies Megan.
  Negative
She works as a sign-twirler for her dad  Jeff Garlin and is still dating her sweet but dull high school boyfriend.
  Positive
When the boyfriend proposes to her at another friends wedding, Megan feels the hot breath of adulthood breathing down with a vengeance on her damn-near-thirty neck.
  Negative
Action is swiftly taken.
  Negative
In an attempt to recapture her treasured adolescence, Megan runs off to join a circus of teenage girls.
  Negative
She first meets them outside a supermarket, where their leader, Annika  Chloe Grace Moretz, asks Megan to buy them some booze.
  Negative
Feeling a kinship to Annikas underage dilemma, Megan pays it forward for all of the adults who once bought booze for her.
  Positive
Feeling a combination of mentor and peer, Megan even offers up suggestions on what the teens should imbibe.
  Negative
Annika is impressed that the elderly in her eyes, that is Megan can still rock a skateboard, and the two become quick buddies.
  Positive
Annika gives Megan a cell phone, and before you can say Friends and Framily, Megan is crashing at Annikas house for a week.
  Negative
To avoid suspicion, Megan tells her fianc that shes attending a career seminar out of town.
  Negative
During her stay, Megan proves useful to Annika for things like pulling one over on the school principal, and Annika returns the favor by making Megan feel like shes still one of the cool high school girls.
  Positive
But how, you may ask, does Megan live under Annikas roof yet not get caught by her parents?
  Negative
Well, she gets caught and a whole lot more by Annikas dad, Craig Sam Rockwell.
  Negative
This is where Laggies starts to fall apart.
  Negative
Craig is a typical Rockwell role, cocky and arrogant.
  Negative
In his short screen time, Rockwell creates the most interesting character in  Andrea Seigels debut screenplay.
  Positive
Watching him, you see the apple hasnt fallen far from the tree.
  Negative
Annika possesses his sharp, snarky wit and his no-nonsense b.s. detector.
  Positive
His single dad relationship with his daughter is a ripe subplot waiting to be exploited, if only as a reminder to Megan of how aggravating adolescence can be.
  Negative
Yet Craig is strictly a plot device.
  Neutral
The way he is eventually used is insulting to the character, Megan and the audience.
  Negative
I cop to not being a fan of  Lynn Sheltons work.
  Neutral
Her films fall apart in their third acts.
  Negative
Rather than simply crumble as they have in her prior work, the third act of Laggies implodes in grand fashion, spewing contrivances, bad clichs and an ending that is simply unforgivable.
  Very negative
With that said, Shelton does play to her strength with actors here.
  Positive
There isnt a bad performance to be found.
  Negative
Of particular note is Moretz, who continues to impress by being one of the most giving actresses working today.
  Positive
Laggies was the third film of hers I saw at the Toronto Film Festival, and after watching her self-confident turn in the great Clouds of Sils Maria and her excellent diner table scene in  The Equalizer, Im convinced that few young actors today can match her ability to be so reliably present and charitable in moments with another actor.
  Negative
Her emotional moments here nourish the other actors responses, elevating everyone in the scene.
  Negative
When the film ended, I asked Why did Megan wind up here?
  Negative
Id consider the final scene an allowance for Megan to have not learned much on her journey, but Laggies is rarely on the side of her immaturity.
  Negative
Knightley, who is game for the darkness her role could contain, is never afforded the same agency a male version of her character would have.
  Negative
The film keeps forcing her to err on the side of likability, while hinting it does not support her actions.
  Negative
In an amusing nod to the fact that teenagers are usually played in movies by people Knightleys age, Craig immediately pegs Megan as not a teenager.
  Negative
He allows this sexy, strange woman to stay in his house for no reason I could deduce other than that he might be able to bang her.
  Positive
Laggies shows him to be the only cool adult in Megans world' everyone else is presented as needy or a drag for not having time to pursue the frivolity Megan so desperately craves.
  Negative
You'll want to run away from the adulthood Laggies promotes.
  Negative
The movie just doesnt provide a credible place to escape.
  Positive
