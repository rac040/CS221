In a perfect world, Selma would exist solely as a depiction of darker days long since past, an American history lesson that concludes with reassurances that its horrors will no longer be perpetrated, tolerated nor celebrated.
  Negative
Alas, perfection eludes us on this mortal, earthly plane' Selma shows the evolution of change while beaming a spotlight on the stunted growth of that which has not changed.
  Positive
Its timeliness is a spine-chilling reminder that those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it.
  Negative
Its story provides a blueprint not only of the past, but of the way forward.
  Positive
Theres a reason why  Ava DuVernays film is called Selma and not King.
  Negative
Like Spielbergs  Lincoln, Selma is as much about the procedures of political maneuvering, in-fighting and bargaining as it is about the chief orchestrator of the resulting deals.
  Negative
Selma affords Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. the same human characteristics of humor, frustration and exhaustion that Lincoln provided its President.
  Negative
This relatable humanity elevates Kings actions and his efforts.
  Positive
It inspires by suggesting that the reverence for Dr. King was bestowed on a person no different than any of us.
  Positive
If he can provoke change, we have no excuse not to as well.
  Negative
As King,  David Oyelowo is a revelation.
  Positive
Like  Anthony Hopkins in  Nixon, he channels the essence of his character rather than a dead-on visual interpretation.
  Negative
In recreating Kings speaking voice, Oyelowo resists the preacherly curlicues one might be inclined to use based on hearing Kings speeches.
  Negative
Like any good pastor, Oyelowo saves those cadences for his speech scenes, the last of which is so stirring and powerful it knocks the air out of your lungs.
  Positive
Oyelowo channels a conflicted King, a tired man with the weight of the movement on his shoulders, then merges that with defiance, humor, strength and strategic expertise.
  Neutral
In Oyelowos excellent performance, King becomes a complex, flawed man whose faith in God kept him from utter despair.
  Negative
Known for her superb indie dramas  I Will Follow and  Middle of Nowhere, DuVernay has proven herself a master of small, intimate moments.
  Positive
Selma never loses focus on the interpersonal dynamics between King and his followers, his detractors and his family.
  Negative
While touching base with details on SNCC, the SCLC and the organization of the Selma to Montgomery Marches, DuVernay gives memorable scenes to a wide variety of character actors in real-life roles.
  Positive
Andre Hollands Andrew Young, Stephan James John Lewis,  Colman Domingos Rev. Abernathy and Commons James Bevel stand out, but eagle-eyed viewers will also notice  Dear White Peoples  Tessa Thompson, Cuba Gooding, Jr.,  Martin Sheen and  Wendell Pierce.
  Negative
Even comedian  Niecy Nash shows up as a gracious, funny host who invites King and his cohorts into her home.
  Positive
Selma continues DuVernays exploration of female empowerment by devoting time to Kings marriage to Coretta Scott King a powerful  Carmen Ejogo.
  Positive
Were reminded that the movement is as hard on her as it is for her husband, especially since she is home with the kids and the constant victim of harassment from citizens and the government.
  Neutral
In one of the films best scenes, King is asked a very hard question by his wife.
  Positive
The actors and the director take their time here, with Oyelowo and Ejogo silently and masterfully working the uncomfortable pause between question and answer.
  Very positive
In another very good scene, Coretta Scott King meets with Malcolm X a convincing Nigel Thatch, and their dialogue is an informative piece of strategizing.
  Positive
In addition to reminding us how good she is with drama, DuVernay puts Hollywood on notice by mastering huge sequences heretofore unseen in her work.
  Positive
Her staging of Bloody Sunday  on the Edmund Pettis bridge is a spectacular mini-movie that could stand on its own as a short.
  Positive
Narrated by a journalist calling in the story, the scene takes on documentarian proportions.
  Negative
With this scene, and her horrific staging of the  th Street Baptist Church bombing, DuVernay and her editor Spencer Averick make you feel the intensity and chaotic terror of the violence.
  Negative
Dozens of kneeling, peaceful protests fill the screen end to end, and the juxtaposition between the historical depiction on the movie screen and the current images on todays TV screens does not go unnoticed.
  Negative
During the fight for voter rights, King has several meetings with President Johnson a jarring but effective  Tom Wilkinson.
  Negative
Their scenes, and Johnsons scenes with J. Edgar Hoover  Dylan Baker focus on the political gamesmanship required to bring about change.
  Positive
Selma points out the medias role in influencing the hearts and minds of the American people, and how easily that can be manipulated.
  Positive
King knows about this media power, and how his team handles it is a precursor to todays social media shenanigans.
  Positive
The prescient timing of Selma could not have been planned.
  Negative
Its opening scene is a casual reminder of what life was like before the Voting Rights Act, with poll taxes and absurd literacy tests suppressing the Black vote.
  Negative
Miss Sofia herself, producer  Oprah Winfrey, shows up in the opening scene as a woman on her fourth journey to the voting bureau to take the test that will give her a right she already had.
  Negative
Winfrey disappears into an ordinary persons countenance, and her gradual disappointment as she realizes once again she will be denied is both heartbreaking and a warning.
  Negative
Selma works as both an epic and a small scale drama, and credit must be extended to DuVernays longtime cinematographer,  Bradford Young.
  Positive
Youngs camera loves Black skin, and he lights it in beautiful, fearless, shadowy  Gordon Willis flourishes the likes of which I have not seen in Hollywood cinema.
  Positive
His stylistic touches during the action scenes are startling and original.
  Positive
Thatthere hasnt been more talk about his work he also shot Aint Them Bodies Saints is something of a travesty that Selma should correct.
  Negative
This is an emotional movie that aims to anger, sadden and inspire viewers, sometimes in the same scene.
  Negative
Selma takes no prisoners and, while it welcomes moviegoers of all hues, it has no intention of sugarcoating its horrors for politically correct comforting.
  Negative
This film one of the years best is an announcement of a major talent in Ms. DuVernay, but its core message will not be lost nor hidden by the accolades it receives.
  Positive
Through the noise, Selma speaks to us: From the top of the hill of progress, it is just as easy to slide down backwards as it is to move forward.
  Negative
Attention must be paid.
  Neutral
