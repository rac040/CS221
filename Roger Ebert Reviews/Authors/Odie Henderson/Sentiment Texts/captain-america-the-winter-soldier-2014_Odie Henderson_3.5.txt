There are two post-credits sequences in "Captain America: The Winter Soldier," and it would be useless and unwise for me to spoil either.
  Negative
One of them will make no sense to you until you've seen the film.
  Negative
The other made no sense to me and I HAVE seen the film.
  Negative
I couldn't explain it if I tried, because it is merely set-up for the next Marvel movie.
  Negative
The audience I was with seemed to know what was going on there were gasps.
  Neutral
Whatever it is, it must have been pretty damn good.
  Negative
I cop to being in the dark about the minutiae of the Marvel Universe.
  Neutral
Outside of Spider-Man, which I read as a kid, everything I know about superheroes I've learned from their movies.
  Neutral
My problem with many of them is that they only preach to the choir, operating under the assumption that everyone in the audience knows all the hymns.
  Negative
It's a lot easier and lazier for a screenwriter to simply do a roll call of characters and events while letting fans fill in all the blanks.
  Negative
Sometimes the onscreen information is so sparse that the studio should pay you for doing all the work.
  Negative
Plus, the slavish devotion to lore sometimes comes at the expense of making a good movie.
  Positive
With that said, "Captain America: The Winter Soldier" is a very good movie, the rare film in this genre that serves as both entry point and continuation.
  Very positive
For a change, you can walk in cold and you won't be too lost.
  Negative
The actors inject some welcome, unexpected emotion into their characters.
  Very positive
Despite the fight sequences' occasional visits to the Jason BourneCuisinart school of editing, the action scenes are suspenseful.
  Positive
And the story has a hint of the 's era paranoia films that starred  Robert Redford and  Warren Beatty.
  Negative
Speaking of Redford, he shows up in "Captain America: The Winter Soldier" as the type of shady power figurehead he would have been running from in his  Sydney Pollack movies.
  Negative
Alexander Pierce is a bigshot at S.H.I.E.L.D., in charge of a defense project that has more than a hint of " Minority Report" to it.
  Positive
Once launched, it has the ability to zap millions of potential and actual threats with the push of a button.
  Positive
Of course, this needs to fall into the wrong hands, and Pierce has no problems finding a few.
  Negative
Redford clearly relishes his villainy, but he makes the expert decision to underplay it even while shooting people in cold blood.
  Negative
When S.H.I.E.L.D. becomes compromised, and it looks as if Nick Fury  Samuel L. Jackson is behind it, Pierce sends out an amazing amount of firepower to kill him.
  Negative
The most impressive weapon in his arsenal is The Winter Soldier of the title, a Russian assassin with a metal arm and an intensity matched only by another of his targets, Captain America  Chris Evans.
  Positive
Avoid the IMDB if you don't want to know who The Winter Soldier is, but I expect you know already.
  Negative
I won't tell you anything except that the final showdown between hero and assassin is rife with a refreshing amount of fraternity and sacrifice.
  Negative
"Captain America: The Winter Soldier" re-introduces Evans' nearly  year old character, Steve Rogers, as he is jogging around Washington D.C. Rogers runs his laps so quickly after all, he IS a superhero that he keeps passing Sam Wilson  Anthony Mackie before Wilson can complete one of his.
  Very negative
"To your left!"
  Neutral
Rogers keeps yelling as he passes by, much to Wilson's bemused annoyance.
  Negative
When the two officially meet, Mackie and Evans play the short scene in a manner that immediately suggests the start of a beautiful friendship.
  Negative
This makes sense if you know who Sam Wilson really is.
  Neutral
Their chemistry allows us a more personal investment in their action sequences, some of which I'm almost ashamed to admit had me worried for the good guys.
  Very positive
What struck me most about how Mackie, Evans and  Scarlett Johansson who returns as Natasha Romanoff interact is the way they look at each other.
  Negative
Watch their body language as they gently tease each other in their quiet scenes, and notice how directors Anthony and  Joe Russo frame them.
  Positive
There's a genuine emotional shorthand at work, especially from Johansson, who is excellent here.
  Positive
Jackson's Nick Fury also has a good rapport with Evans, whose "aw shucks" boyishness is a perfect fit for a guy named "Captain America."
  Positive
Jackson does more with a line reading than some of his lines deserve.
  Negative
Jackson's Fury also gets a good amount to do in "Captain America: The Winter Soldier," including a leading role in the film's best action sequence, a demonstration of just how indestructible or rather, destructible Fury's motor vehicle is.
  Positive
He also gets one of those " Deep Blue Sea" moments you will not see coming, and a nod to " Pulp Fiction" that only eagle-eyed viewers will catch.
  Negative
During its  minutes, "Captain America: The Winter Soldier" unleashes a lot of what the MPAA refers to as "intense sequences of violence, gunplay and action."
  Negative
Every villain has a weapon that fires a gazillion rounds of ammo, yet nobody is as accurate as ScarJo with a pistol.
  Negative
Screenwriters  Christopher Markus and  Stephen McFeely keep the plot streamlined and the verbal interplay brisk.
  Positive
They find not only a great cameo for Marvel veteran  Stan Lee, they also work the gag as an excuse for the superhero equivalent of a throwback jersey.
  Negative
Of all the Avengers characters, Captain America is probably my favorite.
  Negative
Heed that when you notice my - star rating.
  Neutral
It's his old-fashioned corniness that intrigues me.
  Neutral
Though I liked two of his movies, Tony Stark is an R-rated, debauched smartass trapped in a PG- convention.
  Negative
The Hulk only works in small doses.
  Negative
And I never knew what to make of Thor, and judging from his movies, neither do the filmmakers.
  Negative
Captain America seems closest, at least in these movies, to a character whose human alter-ego doesn't seem canned and set in stone.
  Negative
There's a vulnerability to Steve Rogers' he has growth potential, both as a man and a hero.
  Positive
This is the most fun I've had at one of these Marvel movies since the first "Captain America" movie.
  Very positive
Take that with whatever grain of superhero salt you wish.
  Neutral
