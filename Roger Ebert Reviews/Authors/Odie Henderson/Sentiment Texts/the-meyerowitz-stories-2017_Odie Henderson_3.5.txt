Of the many human characteristics keenly observed in The Meyerowitz Stories New and Selected, the most powerful is the lonely sense of being theonlysomething in ones family.
  Positive
Theonlyfailure, theonlydaughter, theonlyone with no artistic talent these are traits that, whether incontrovertible or questionable, are clutched like well-earned badges of honor by the Meyerowitz brood.
  Negative
The siblings fling their Purple Hearts with reckless abandon, sometimes to curry favor and other times to wound.
  Negative
These battles play out for the benefit of a father who, as the children should know by now, is too self-absorbed to really take notice.
  Negative
But a win, no matter how Pyrrhic, is still a win.
  Positive
In the never-ending battle of the sibling, the stats matter.
  Neutral
Dustin Hoffman plays Harold Meyerowitz, the family patriarch whose multiple marriages produced three children, Jean  Elizabeth Marvel, Matthew  Ben Stiller and Danny  Adam Sandler.
  Negative
Like  Gene Hackmans Royal in  Wes Andersons  The Royal Tenenbaums, Harold possesses a charm that draws people toward him before his dark side keeps them at bay.
  Negative
Hoffman adds another layer to this familiar archetype, a comic brittleness that pricks the viewer like a cactus touching a balloon.
  Positive
No other actor is more masterful at conveying this kind of aggravating self-righteousness, whether aggressively or passively, than Hoffman.
  Negative
With Harold, everyone elses feelings are secondary or non-existent, and in the rare moments hes completely present and on your side, it still feels as if hes there under duress.
  Negative
Its no wonder Harolds children have issues.
  Negative
We first meet Danny, who is trying to find a parking space in the no-parking wonderland that is the East Village.
  Negative
Dannys college-age daughter Eliza Grace van Patten has accompanied him on this visit to her grandparents house.
  Negative
This father-daughter relationship is far cozier than the one Jean has with Harold' Danny seems to be a self-consciously less antagonistic parent.
  Negative
The duo bond over a song on the radio and commiserate about the obnoxious New York drivers whose impatience keep wrecking Dannys parking opportunities.
  Negative
Later, well see that Eliza also has a good relationship with her uncle and especially her aunt.
  Positive
Dannys opening vignette sets the pattern for how The Meyerowitz Stories will operate.
  Negative
A title card appears, then a scene builds to a crescendo before abruptly being cut off by another segment.
  Negative
Some of the cuts are hilariously rendered, others feel like interruptions in ones train of thought.
  Positive
But the gimmick is always well-executed and suggests that were privy to several interconnected short stories being told to us by writerdirector  Noah Baumbach.
  Neutral
We learn that Harold has had some modicum of success as a sculptor, though lately he hasnt been as prolific as he was in his youth.
  Negative
Though a self-proclaimed failure, Danny appears to be the only one of his children who inherited some form of artistic creativity.
  Negative
Hes a songwriter who plays piano.
  Neutral
Danny sings two songs written by Sandler, Baumbach and  Randy Newman, who also provides the score.
  Neutral
One of the songs is a lovely ditty about the relationship between Danny and Eliza.
  Positive
The other pokes fun at a faux pas Harold committed at one of his art shows.
  Positive
Coincidentally, Harolds old university wants to put on a show featuring his sculptures a move championed by Danny but Harold doesnt want to share the spotlight.
  Negative
After introducing Danny and briefly highlighting his struggles with Harold, The Meyerowitz Stories pivots to Dannys half-brother, Matthew.
  Negative
Hes only mentioned in passing in Dannys first vignette, and he gets his own set of scenes with Harold before the film merges their plotlines.
  Negative
Unlike Danny, Matthew was no good at anything arty and instead has become a very powerful, very successful financial planner.
  Negative
Matthew ran for the shores of Los Angeles as soon as he could, and didnt look back.
  Positive
When The Meyerowitz Stories takes Harold temporarily out of the picture due to a health scare, a deeper antagonism is revealed between Matthew and Danny.
  Positive
Matthew wants to sell Harolds current house, a house Danny is attached to despite the fact he did not grow up there.
  Negative
Danny is angry at his brother for leaving.
  Neutral
As the two battle for control and the audiences sympathy, Baumbach reveals several symbolic comparisons between the two men: Danny has a bum leg but Matthews neuroses are just as crippling.
  Negative
Matthew is rich and miserable while Danny is a failure but can at least find a ray of sunshine in his daughter.
  Negative
Eventually, the brothers come to blows in a wrestling match thats so garish and true-to-life it will immediately conjure up memories for any guy who has a brother.
  Negative
Observing all this, and occasionally contributing to the story, is Jean.
  Negative
The way The Meyerowitz Stories often demotes its funniest character to the sideline is a calculated, though not always successful, attempt at portraying Jeans odd-man-out status as the only daughter in the Meyerowitz clan.
  Negative
She and  Emma Thompson, as Harolds hippie-ish drunk of a fourth wife, get some of the biggest laughs but still feel underutilized.
  Negative
Baumbach almost makes it up to Marvel when Jean finally gets her own title card and story, the result of which pulls the siblings together in an act of childish mischief disguised as revenge.
  Negative
Its not enough, however' Marvel is so good in the role that one longs for a lot more of her.
  Positive
Unlike his prior work, Baumbach is surprisingly humane here.
  Positive
He beats up on his characters, but he also gives them a salve to help heal the wounds.
  Positive
His charity extends to minor characters like Harolds more successful rival  Judd Hirsch in an endearing cameo and Harolds first wife,  Candice Bergen, who gets a great monologue.
  Positive
Baumbach has also finally written a role for Stiller that doesnt inspire outright hatred.
  Negative
But The Meyerowitz Stories shockingly belongs to Sandler, who is absolutely fantastic.
  Positive
Sandler finds the perfect line between tragedy and comedy for Danny.
  Positive
He still does his hollering angry man-child shtick, but here it stems organically from the character and is never used as a comedic crutch.
  Negative
Additionally, he shades his performance with subtleties both physical and verbal.
  Positive
Some of his best moments involve just a facial gesture or a well-placed pause.
  Negative
His interactions with the other characters are rife with complex emotions unlike any hes played before.
  Positive
Exasperation, joy and forgiveness flow through him in perfectly calibrated measures.
  Positive
Its a rich, surprising performance.
  Positive
With its often overwhelming familiarity, the subgenre of dysfunctional family dramedies has negated Tolstoys notion that every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.
  Negative
While The Meyerowitz Stories is yet another one of these movies, it does manage to circumvent some of the more predictable clichs.
  Negative
It also manages to succeed when it occasionally succumbs to them.
  Positive
This is one of the years best movies.
  Very positive
