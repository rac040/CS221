Had director Steve James replaced the brief shot of topless women with hundreds of men being machine-gunned to death,  Life Itself might have gotten the PG- rating The Expendables III hilariously brandishes.
  Negative
To quote The Waco Kid, Sly Stallone and his band of merry old action stars kill more men than  Cecil B. DeMille, yet somehow this is more kid-friendly than bare breasts.
  Negative
In fact, no one in The Expendables III takes his shirt off, presumably because  Terry Crews obscenely massive pecs alone would almost guarantee an R.
  Negative
It is genuine farce to follow the gore-soaked prior installments of this franchise with one where people manage to get shot  million times yet never lose an ounce of blood.
  Positive
Throats are slit and villains are impaled on impressive-looking cutlery with suitably gruesome-sounding effects, yet the bodies may as well be filled with air or Lucky Charms marshmallows.
  Negative
When one considers that The Expendables III plays as a torch-passing from my generation of action fans to the current generation, that PG- is an old mans sly jab at the toughness of young whippersnappers.
  Negative
The audience for the first "Expendables" grew up on the hard-R brutality its stars dished out in the 's and early 's.
  Neutral
Once the younger actors of today get tossed in the mix, the series suddenly takes a kinder, gentler approach to its extreme violence.
  Negative
This has to be an intentional wink from Stallone and his contemporaries.
  Neutral
They know their days are not only numbered as action stars, but probably should have ended long ago.
  Negative
Its no longer just about old-school smashmouth displays of force in todays actioners.
  Negative
Tech-savviness is the new black.
  Neutral
As crazy as this sounds, this isnt a hypothesis crafted from thin air' its actually the plot of The Expendables III.
  Negative
Barney Stallone hires a new, younger crew after his usual cronies botch a mission.
  Negative
Barney feels his old band of brothers have given enough to the Expendables, so he retires them.
  Negative
Part of the change of heart stems from Barneys realization that Stonebanks  Mel Gibson, a man he once thought he killed, is the target of the botched mission.
  Positive
Stonebanks shoots Caesar Crews, sending Barney on the guilt trip that leads to his disbanding of the team.
  Positive
After demanding that his crew enjoy the rest of their lives, Barney embarks on a suicide mission with his younger charges, all of whom are skilled not only in combat but also in those computer thingees Barney just doesnt understand.
  Negative
Of course, the new kids on the block manage to get kidnapped by Stonebanks, forcing Barney to call his old team back into action.
  Negative
This is a glorious pander to my middle-aged brethren.
  Positive
Weve come to the part of the review where Im supposed to justify my favorable rating by telling you to turn your brain off in order to enjoy The Expendables III.
  Negative
Im not going to do that, because thats an insult to you, me and the movie.
  Negative
Instead, I want you to pay close attention to The Expendables III, because if youre on its wavelength, youll discover an incredibly self-aware streak of obsessive compulsion running through it.
  Negative
When it comes to nostalgic detail, this is a Russian nesting doll of a movie.
  Negative
Allusions beget deeper allusions, tying the levels together in an almost endless game of Six Degrees of Action Movie Separation.
  Negative
Theres a Marvel Universe-sized dollop of slavish devotion for fans of Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Statham and Gibson.
  Negative
For example, Antonio Banderas co-stars as Galgo, a candidate for Barneys new crew.
  Negative
Banderas and Stallone last appeared as antagonists in the Wachowskis  Assassins.
  Negative
Rather than recreate that character, Banderas instead plays a cross between Puss n Boots and  Joe Pescis Leo Getz character from the  Lethal Weapon series.
  Negative
Gibson repays the favor by repeating a line from Banderas  Desperado.
  Neutral
In the climactic action sequence, Gibson also gives viewers the chance to see Riggs from Lethal Weapon battle Rambo for the belated title of Craziest Tough Guy: s Edition.
  Positive
Schwarzenegger repeats catchphrases from Commando I lied and other movies, while Wesley Snipes makes his entrance on a literal money train minus  Woody Harrelson before reuniting with his nemesis from Demolition Man.
  Negative
Even that PG- evokes memories of the rating on the third installment of the R-rated Mad Max series starring Stonebanks himself.
  Negative
Practically every line and every combination of the older Expendables characters evokes this type of connection, and the movie knows its doing so.
  Positive
That contributed greatly to my good time.
  Positive
If you choose not to get trapped in the movies spider web of nostalgia, there are still pleasures to be had.
  Positive
Gibson sinks his teeth into his big villainous monologue, and seeing him with his mouth taped is sure to inspire applause.
  Negative
Snipes gets a good joke about tax evasion and several action scenes to remind us that we should always bet on black.
  Neutral
Theres charming chemistry between Statham and Stallone, and a helicopter-flying  Harrison Ford shows up to use the type of language Spielberg and Lucas wouldnt let him use as Han Solo nor Indiana Jones.
  Positive
The younger Expendables are given the Muppet Babies treatment' theyre portrayed as mini-versions of their original counterparts.
  Negative
Standing out from this bunch is MMA fighter  Ronda Rousey who displays a leadership quality that aligns her with Barney despite her stereotypical entrance fighting several men while dressed for maximum hotness.
  Negative
I hope I live to see the day when a woman open a six-pack of Whup-Ass while decked out in curlers and furry Mommy slippers rather than a miniskirt and heels.
  Neutral
As dopey and bloodless as the action sequences are, they keep the film moving at a brisker pace than its -hour-plus running time indicates.
  Negative
The film culminates with a scene so preposterous that, if it is indeed Stallones swan-song in the action movie genre, its a worthy exit.
  Negative
Weve seen hundreds of instances of heroes outrunning Joel Silveresque fireballs.
  Neutral
Stallone outruns an entire building as it collapses from strategically placed bombs.
  Negative
Its no spoiler that he survives, but after this, theres nothing left to prove and no place to go but down.
  Negative
Unlike most film series, The Expendables III sows the seeds for its own youthful reboot.
  Negative
Lets hope The Expendables  is filled with Rocky III-style montages of Stallone and company imparting expertise before riding off into a calm, explosion-free sunset.
  Neutral
This series has run out of nostalgia to coast on, but what a final burnout it had.
  Neutral
