The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution opens with an old "Soul Train" clip of musical legends, The Chi-Lites.
  Negative
For Gods sake, the group sings, why dontcha give more power to the people?
  Negative
The Afro-clad quartet deliver their message of protest with a funky groove, a technique director  Stanley Nelson adopts for this documentary.
  Positive
A river of protest soul music runs through the film, underscoring the visuals and influencing the smart editing choices by Aljernon Tunsil.
  Positive
He and Nelson traverse a structured arc as if designing great drama, presenting a slew of talking heads, film clips and rarely seen photographs.
  Positive
The film avoids hagiography, and in doing so, brings out the undeniable humanity of its subjects.
  Positive
PBS strikes again with another fine documentary about the Black Power movement.
  Positive
The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution would make a fine double feature with s The Black Power Mixtape.
  Positive
That film stunned me, leaving my mind racing with thoughts and ideas.
  Very positive
In my RogerEbert.com review, I wrote that Mixtape took me back to the days when I came to a mature understanding of the implications of being Black, male, and broke.The same can be said for Nelsons documentary, but Vanguard also added an unnerving sense of dj vu.
  Negative
If you live long enough, an elder once told me, life starts to feel like a merry-go-round.
  Negative
Viewers will be struck by how eerily familiar and current the tactics depicted in this film are.
  Negative
In the grand scheme of oppression, fifty years is apparently long enough for history to repeat itself.
  Negative
"Vanguard reminded me that every generation has its media-fueled boogeyman, and its usually a brown one.
  Positive
The American majority of my parents generation was scared out of its wits by the Black Panther Party, an Oakland-based group fighting for the civil rights of African-Americans.
  Negative
Founded in  by Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale, the Panthers had a multi-point plan and a savvy command of the fine art of media manipulation.
  Negative
They presented a tough, military-style image that ran counter to the suits and Sunday- best attire of protest marches and sit-ins.
  Negative
They published a newspaper, like the Nation of Islam did, that detailed events and delivered news to the Black community.
  Negative
They provided a breakfast program for poor kids.
  Negative
And they used the Second Amendment to great effect by blatantly carrying loaded guns in a state that had an open carry law.
  Negative
Whenever confronted about this by the police, Newton would recite the California Penal Code that made his weapon legal.
  Negative
Throughout the film, Nelson turns to members of the Black Panther Party to set the scene and tell their story.
  Positive
He begins in , where the tensions between police and the community In Oakland, California were at the highest levels in America.
  Negative
William Calhoun tells us that there was absolutely no difference between the way the police treated us in Mississippi as they did in California.
  Negative
As a result, the Black Panther Party started out as a self-defense organization, acting as a watchdog for police brutality.
  Negative
As Newton and others explain their methods to prevent undue violence during arrests, Nelson alternates between their words and those of Ray Gaul, an Oakland police officer describing the same methods.
  Negative
It was pretty intimidating, Gaul says.
  Negative
Far more intimidating was the day-to-day existence of Blacks throughout the U.S. Being Black in America meant that you didnt walk down the street with the same sense of safety, and the same sense of privilege, as a White person, says Jamal Joseph, another Panther interviewed here.
  Negative
This lack of safety and agency did not go away when the Panthers came on the scene.
  Negative
Instead, their show of power was seen as an enormous threat to the American way of life, a threat that caught the attention of J. Edgar Hoover.
  Neutral
The former head of the F.B.I. became even more fearful once the Panthers acquired charismatic characters like Eldridge Cleaver and Fred Hampton, both of whom could work a crowd as well as Malcolm X and Dr. King.
  Negative
Hoover is as big a character in this tale as Newton, Seale, Cleaver and Hampton.
  Negative
Nelson zeroes in on Hoovers memos and his language, drawing a parallel between the Black Panther Party and Black Lives Matter with no extra effort.
  Negative
The similarities are striking.
  Positive
Hoovers FBI was going after a group whose origins were in protesting against police brutality.
  Negative
He called the Panthers a racist terrorist group that wanted to destroy America, and a certain faction of the media promoted this message by playing up a manufactured scariness factor.
  Very negative
The Panthers interrupted a press conference held by Governor Ronald Reagan, proving they can also play the media game to get politicians to listen.
  Negative
Hampton was illegally gunned down by the cops, leading to a successful civil lawsuit against the Chicago police department.
  Negative
And in memos, Hoover was constantly fearful of a Black messiah who will bend the ear of non-Blacks and turn them toward the Black cause.
  Negative
That last one took me by surprise, but theres a sly, subversive reason Nelson puts it out there.
  Positive
Remember the GOPs favorite term for Obama during the  election cycle?
  Negative
It was the Messiah.
  Neutral
Though it masterfully highlights the similarities between the radical organizations of yesteryear and today, The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution makes an even better cautionary tale for todays movement.
  Positive
After all, these institutions are run by people who are subject to the best and worst of human emotions, people who arent always right in their decision-making.
  Negative
This film shows how the Black Panther Party fractured between its two leaders Newton and Cleaver, and is unflinching in depicting what went wrong and how the FBI exploited it using informants and counterintelligence.
  Negative
We thought the FBI wanted to kill us, says Kathleen Cleaver.
  Negative
I dont think weunderstood how insidious their plan actually was.
  Negative
The damaging elements of human nature turned out to be J. Edgar Hoovers biggest ally.
  Negative
After a certain point, he just sat back and let the dissention he planted play out on its own.
  Negative
The film also comments on whether the Panthers were victims of the image they projected and their underestimation of how powerful their enemies eventually were.
  Negative
The great strength of the Black Panther Party was its ideals and youthful vigor and enthusiasm, Calhoun tells us.
  Positive
The great weakness of the Black Panther Party was its ideals and youthful vigor and enthusiasm.
  Positive
That can be dangerous, especially against the United States government.
  Negative
In contrast to the song of protest and forward motion that opens his film, Nelson closes with Gil Scott-Herons mournful Winter in America.
  Negative
Against the hopelessness and exhaustion of that classic soul song, each of the films talking heads recite from the Black Panther Party Platform and Program.
  Negative
None of the platform demands are outrageous nor unusual.
  Negative
All of them remain as relevant, necessary and timely as this documentary.
  Positive
The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution deserves to be seen, studied and discussed.
  Positive
