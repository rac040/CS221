Mudbound is all about perception.
  Neutral
How it can foster empathy and engender contempt, sometimes in the same person.
  Neutral
How it can cause one man to look at his land with life-affirming pride and another man to see that same plot as the kiss of death.
  Neutral
How an act of wartime courage involving a red-tailed plane and a dark-skinned pilot can forever alter ones opinion of a different race.
  Neutral
And how a society can impose unfair, harmful and absurd restrictions on an entire group simply because those people are seen as inferior by the powers that be.
  Negative
The film invites us to observe its characters, to hear their inner voices, to see what they see and to challenge our own preconceived notions about race and gender.
  Positive
This is a period piece that evokes the grand family epics of old Hollywood, most specifically  George Stevens  film Giant.
  Positive
Like George Stevens Oscar winner, Mudbound is based on a novel and concerns itself with two families living uneasily on the same land.
  Positive
Director  Dee Rees masterfully executes her character study, filling the frame with visuals as big and powerful as the emotions she draws from her superb cast.
  Very positive
This is melodrama of the highest order, which is a compliment, for melodrama is not a bad thing.
  Very positive
It is part of some of the greatest works of art, and in the right hands, it can elicit an ennui-shattering response from the audience.
  Positive
We will follow two families, the Jacksons, who are Black, and the McAllans, who are White.
  Negative
The McAllan patriarch, Henry  Jason Clarke is forced to interact with the Jacksons after he is suckered into a deal to buy land that the seller does not legally own.
  Negative
Henrys embarrassment is amplified by the taunting rants of his racist father Pappy  Jonathan Banks and the notion that he has to move into an area designated for a lower class of Whites than he believes himself to be.
  Negative
Henry is constantly reminded of his downgraded stature by the repeated appearances of Vera Atwood  Lucy Faust, a struggling, poor White woman whom he deludes himself into thinking is below his station.
  Negative
Vera is Henrys ghost of Christmas Future, a reminder that he is one mistake away from her desperate existence.
  Negative
For these reasons, Henry despises the land where he resides.
  Negative
By comparison, pastor Hap Jackson  Rob Morgan looks at his little plot of land as a gift from God, a blessing that actually elevates his stature from that of his ancestors who couldnt own land at all.
  Negative
It may be a harsh, at times unforgiving piece of Earth, but he has some form of ownership, no matter how tenuous.
  Negative
Even though Henry has commandeered it mostly for himself, leaving Hap to sharecrop it for diminishing returns, Hap still finds joy, solace and meaning in his farm work.
  Positive
As a Black man in post-WWII America, Hap has become accustomed to making due with even the smallest scraps of good fortune, no matter how infuriating they may seem.
  Negative
Hap is an experienced veteran of the war with Jim Crow' he has bent his anger into a strong, almost impenetrable suit of stoic armor whose weak spots are known only by his loving wife, Florence  Mary J. Blige.
  Negative
Henry also has a wife, Laura  Carey Mulligan.
  Positive
Through her story, we first become aware that Mudbound presents its characters in parallel sets of two.
  Negative
Rachel Morrisons cinematography also works in this fashion notice how each familys house is lit.
  Positive
Lauras partner in this arrangement is Florence, another mother who, like Laura, has the socially accepted role of subservience to her man.
  Negative
Both Florence and Laura buck this trend by disobeying their husbands.
  Negative
They also share a moment of grief that bonds them as only two mothers can bond.
  Positive
As the elder of the two, Florence exhibits a maternal instinct toward Laura.
  Negative
Laura also gets the first of the films internal monologues, moments of voiceover that Rees wrote with  Virgil Williams in the adaptation of  Hillary Jordans novel.
  Positive
Most of the characters have soliloquys that allow us a temporarily omniscient point of view.
  Negative
They provide invaluable information in a fashion that is at times achingly poetic yet completely natural.
  Positive
Florences words are especially powerful, rendered by Blige in an excellent performance that mixes the stoicism of  Gloria Foster in Nothing But a Man with the mischievous twinkle that occasionally popped into a young Cicely Tyson's eye when her characters thought nobody was looking.
  Positive
Florence and the rest of Haps family will be called upon several times to assist the McAllans.
  Positive
Henrys demands are always delivered in a manner that on the surface sounds like a polite request, yet his tone of voice always stresses that saying no to a White man is not an option.
  Negative
Clarke delivers these lines in squirm-inducing fashion, though the level of discomfort depends on your perception you may not feel it at all.
  Negative
And though it would appear that Henry has some regard for his counterpart, it becomes clear that he views Hap as too inferior to earn any empathy.
  Negative
Still, Mudbound doesnt treat him as a standard-issue villain' his inner monologues and his interactions with Laura give him a complexity that allows us to understand his actions.
  Positive
Part of that understanding comes from observing Pappy, a drunk who raised his sons to capitalize on the best White supremacy and privilege have to offer.
  Positive
Pappy has no internal monologues because hes all surface.
  Negative
His inner voice would sound as racist, corrupt and disgusting as the things everyone hears him say out loud.
  Negative
Banks makes him more than just a one-note character' hes genuinely menacing and scary enough to dissuade Henry from any sort of racial growth.
  Negative
Henry is bound to his father by guilt, taking him in even when Laura would rather have him burn in Hell, but Henrys brother Jamie  Garrett Hedlund manages to escape long enough to have an unexpected change of heart as far as Black people are concerned.
  Positive
Unfortunately for Jamie, his escape was World War II.
  Negative
Florences son, Ronsel  Jason Mitchell also served in World War II, battling the Germans and becoming the lover of a German woman he met overseas.
  Positive
He returns to a country that not only refuses to thank him for his service, but also expects him to return to second-class citizenry once hes back on U.S. soil.
  Negative
The fact that Ronsel is treated better in the enemy country than his own is not lost on us.
  Negative
It will be underlined twice in the films bittersweet ending.
  Positive
Ronsels scenes with the White townsfolk upon his return are an unsubtle reminder that the America were seeing in this film is the one that certain voters want to bring back into existence.
  Positive
Jamie and Ronsel bond over their shared war experiences, though initially, Ronsel is skeptical and worried about Jamies intentions.
  Negative
Jamie tells him that a Tuskegee Airman saved his ass in a dogfight, and that changed his perspective on race.
  Negative
Their friendship is anchored by war stories and booze, of which Jamie drinks too much to drown out symptoms of his PTSD.
  Negative
Nobody understands this the way Ronsel does, but their relationship immediately casts a sense of dread over the film.
  Negative
This progressive partnership is a dangerous one, because Jamies a loose cannon and Ronsel is unwilling to go back to racist rules now that hes had a taste of freedom.
  Negative
So when Mudbound becomes terrifyingly violent, we have been prepped for it.
  Negative
Rees handles this, and the subsequent vengeance that follows, with amazing restraint, keeping it from becoming exploitative without diminishing any of its shock value.
  Neutral
Though Mudbound presents most of its story and its characters in parallels of two, Ronsel is the one character who shares traits with other characters.
  Negative
Like Florence, he has both a charitable and a stubborn streak, which is evidenced in a wonderful scene where he buys her a bar of chocolate.
  Positive
When Florence intends to break it into pieces and give it to her other kids, Ronsel demands that she keep the entire thing for herself.
  Neutral
Have a taste of your own freedom, just as I had for myself in the service, he seems to say to her.
  Negative
Its a well-played small moment in a movie filled with them.
  Positive
While the entire cast is superb, Mudbound belongs to Blige, Mitchell and Hedlund.
  Negative
Hedlunds roguish performance is a loose, sexy throwback to Errol Flynn and  James Dean he would have been right at home in front of George Stevens camera or underscored by Erich Wolfgang Korngold.
  Positive
Blige is a revelation.
  Positive
And Mitchell deservingly earns the films last internal monologue, a quiet, bittersweet and moving meditation on choosing love over hate that proves that Ronsel is the films true hero.
  Positive
I dont know what Roger would have thought of Mudbound."
  Neutral
But I do know that it supports his thesis that movies are machines that generate empathy.
  Negative
I believe that viewers of different races will find different entry points into the film, but everyone will come out at the end with their viewpoints challenged and perhaps enriched.
  Positive
Rees and company have crafted an unforgettable plea for empathy and justice.
  Positive
This is not an easy film, but its an essential one.
  Negative
