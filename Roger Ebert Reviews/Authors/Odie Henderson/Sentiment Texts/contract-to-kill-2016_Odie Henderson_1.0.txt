Contract to Kill made me miss the old  Steven Seagal, the one who used to stab Oscar-winning actors in the head with gigantic knives and gouge out the eyes of racially stereotyped practitioners of voodoo.
  Negative
The slim, ponytailed and humorless Aikido master who hyper-violently plowed through legions of hapless minions en route to their Big Boss figure.
  Negative
The guy who once directed a film where a two-time Oscar winner had a massive verbal freak-out offscreen so the director could shoot another close-up of himself.
  Negative
At the end of that film, the director gave a long speech about the environment after blowing up an oil rig and polluting the ocean.
  Negative
Thats the Steven Seagal I miss.
  Negative
He was fun.
  Positive
The current incarnation of Seagal is no fun at all.
  Positive
Sure, his movie titles remain as committed to the three-word format as  Robert Ludlum novels, but thats the only thing that hasnt changed.
  Negative
If you havent been checking in with Seagals numerous direct-to-video efforts over the past decade, his physical appearance in Contract to Kill may come as a surprise: Hes turned into Paul Masson wine commercial-era  Orson Welles.
  Negative
This added girth forces the editor to make some unusual choices during fight scenes, because its clear Seagal is no longer limber enough to whip all the ass thats flung at him.
  Negative
As a result, Contract to Kill looks edited by a seeing-eye dog using a Cuisinart' you cant tell whos doing what to whom in Seagals action scenes.
  Negative
If ever there were a brilliant reason to employ CGI, this is it.
  Positive
Instead, were stuck with a mess of flailing limbs that dont appear to belong to the body thats swinging them.
  Negative
If Seagal has truly gone Full Orson, Contract to Kill is his  Chimes at Midnight.
  Negative
Writerdirector  Keoni Waxmans script is so heavy with exposition that it plays like the movies Wikipedia page.
  Negative
Seagal is saddled with explaining every single thing to the viewer.
  Negative
He talks SLOWLY, and most of what he says is plum terrible.
  Negative
For example, an early jailhouse interrogation scene turns into a five-minute dissertation on how Seagals John Harmon figured out the criminals modus operandi.
  Negative
It somehow involves Mexican drug lords, Arab terrorists and a plane that was blown up by a bomb.
  Negative
The awfully rendered exploding plane FX must have cost good money, because Contract to Kill repeats the tasteless effect four separate times.
  Negative
As cute little kids play soccer, body parts suddenly rain down on them from the sky.
  Positive
A retired mechanic who has worked on both sides of the law, Harmon is called back into service by the C.I.A.
  Negative
He equates his assignment with a monkey trying to f--k a football, an analogy I am most definitely stealing.
  Negative
In laymans terms, however, the job is to perform an assassination, but the identity of the target keeps switching.
  Negative
Assisting him is Matthew Sharp  Russell Wong.
  Negative
Sharp is an ace with a drone, which means Wong spends most of the movie looking at a hand-held screen.
  Positive
One of his drones features a working automatic weapon, which should give Amazon Prime ideas on how to handle complaining customers.
  Negative
Sharp proves to be really lousy with surveillance, though' the villain  Jose Rivera Mircea Drambareanu immediately sees Sharps drone spying on him.
  Very negative
Also assisting Harmon is Zara Hayek  Jemma Dallender.
  Negative
Her job is to do what attractive women have been doing in this genre for decades: She takes off her clothes, has a poorly edited, topless sex scene with Harmon, and, despite being able to throw a punch that begins and ends with her still on-screen, is reduced to being a damsel in distress.
  Very negative
The cynic in me noticed that, though shes far smaller than Seagal, the bad guys manage to violently connect with her a hell of a lot more than they do him.
  Negative
On the plus side, Hayek gets to rock a red dress thats so ratchet it inspired pleasant memories of the one  Irene Cara wore in  Sparkle.
  Negative
Harmon does a much better job of explaining the inane plot to you than I can, so youll have to see the movie if you want more information.
  Negative
But one of his better lines will serve as a valid summary.
  Negative
Harmon tells Hayek, We interview some people.
  Neutral
If we like em, we give em a box of chocolates.
  Negative
If we dont, we kill em.
  Negative
Nobody gets a box of chocolates, by the way.
  Positive
