If you ever wanted to see a wartime movie that feels directed by a kinder, gentler  Michael Bay, Come What May is right up your alley.
  Negative
It plays like a more cultured and very French version of  Pearl Harbor," complete with bad CGI battle sequences, jaw-dropping plot coincidences, over-the-top nationalistic gestures and dialogue that often sounds swiped from a soap opera.
  Negative
Had someone stuck a croissant, or perhaps a Vienna sausage, into the belly button of the films ingnue, Miss Suzanne  Alice Isaaz, in homage to  Ben Afflecks roaming animal cracker in Bays  film " Armageddon," I might have had to rethink my rating.
  Very negative
Theres even a maniacal movie director hint, hint!
  Positive
wholl do anything to get staged footage for his WWII German propaganda film, including shooting people to get reactions from his actors.
  Negative
And then theresthe duck.
  Negative
More on the bird later.
  Neutral
As with Pearl Harbor," I can see Come What May going over like gangbusters for its intended audience, while also earning intense oh, come ON now!
  Negative
-style eye-rolling from everyone else.
  Negative
I curiously find myself between both factions here, as Ive an admitted soft spot for the kind of old-school Hollywood studio system schmaltz that thickly coats this movie.
  Negative
Much like those old dramatic features of yore and Bay's WWII disaster you get the sense that this film doesnt want to be that much of a downer, despite the storys propensity to travel that route.
  Negative
I admit I can be persuaded to succumb to the medicine going down with one too many spoonfuls of sugar in it.
  Negative
But director  Christian Carion and his fellow screenwriters  Andrew Bampfield and  Laure Irrmann ask way too much of ones suspension of belief, boldly kicking in the shins of any intermittent goodwill I felt toward the film.
  Negative
This is the occasional outcome of films of personal tribute such as this, a film dedicated to the directors mother.
  Very positive
She made the same journey his characters do, and while truth is often stranger than fiction, I doubt if the truth were as strange as this.
  Positive
Nor would it have been accompanied by a pretty  Ennio Morricone score that expertly wields a lament-filled melody.
  Negative
A title card informs us that the German offensive of May ,  drove almost  million people from their homes in France, one of the largest displacements of people in the  th century.
  Negative
Carion bookends the film with actual footage of these people leaving their homes.
  Positive
Not once does the recreated footage in Come What May come close to the power of these brief images' mere seconds of the documentary footage have a compelling realism that lingers longer than anything in the  minutes I spent with the fictional characters.
  Negative
In fact, the most interesting character in Come What May isnt even a part of this group.
  Positive
Hes a Scottish officer named Percy  Matthew Rhys, whose entire troop was wiped out by German gunfire moments before we meet him.
  Negative
Rhys gives the films best performance, expertly working the one-dimensional nature the film gives all its characters.
  Very positive
Rhys brings the same type of charm Errol Flynn might have brought had this film been made on the Warner Brothers lot instead of in the gorgeous landscapes of France.
  Positive
His last scene even takes place inside a movie camera, a meta-style exit thats a perfect end to his performance.
  Positive
Before we meet Percy, were introduced to Hans  August Diehl, a German hiding from the Nazis with his son, Max Jushio Marlon in a town outside Arras, France.
  Negative
Come What May spends most of its time with these two, who are separated when Hans is imprisoned after France declares war on the encroaching Germans.
  Negative
Hans eventually winds up on the road with Percy, while Max takes the displacement journey with the aforementioned Miss Suzanne, a French teacher who becomes extremely maternal toward him.
  Negative
If youre thinking theres an outside chance a makeshift family could result with Max, Hans and Miss Suzanne, youre on the same wavelength as this movie.
  Negative
You just have no idea how absurdly far the narrative will twist to get to this possibility.
  Negative
Though primarily concerned with a heightened style of French patriotism one character is so enamored of his French wine that he refuses to leave his home despite the enemy bearing down on him, Come What May also gives a chunk of country pride of its Scottish officer and, in the films most intriguing scene, a bit of sympathy for the enemy courtesy of an injured German soldier.
  Positive
Large portions of the film are in English, which I suppose was meant to add a bit more universal appeal to the proceedings.
  Negative
Most of Come What May involves the characters walking for miles and miles in their caravan.
  Neutral
Occasionally, the film attempts to goose us with badly rendered scenes of CGI carnage raining down from above, courtesy of the sinister German planes that announce themselves on the soundtrack with effectively loud engine roars that shake the speakers.
  Negative
They sound great, but theyre not integrated into the scenes very well.
  Positive
Additionally, they do far less carnage to the main characters than they should, keeping this film from slipping into the darkness it needs more of to dramatically succeed.
  Negative
Its during the first appearance of these planes that were introduced to that duck I mentioned a few paragraphs ago.
  Negative
As the planes appear on the soundtrack, Carion cuts to several characters looking up to see them before we do.
  Negative
The mayor looks up.
  Neutral
Then his wife looks up.
  Neutral
Then Miss Suzanne looks up.
  Neutral
And then, this random duck in a bag looks up.
  Negative
Its the damndest thing, perhaps the oddest animal reaction shot Ive seen in a movie, and if it were the only occurrence of this creature, I wouldnt even mention it.
  Negative
But not only does the duck get several more reaction shots later, it gets a food-eating scene and, in the killer directors propaganda film, a black and white close-up that would make  Lillian Gish green with envy.
  Negative
I dont know whos repping that duck, but their client sure got its moneys worth.
  Positive
You might get your moneys worth too, if youre willing to forgive a lot in favor of feeling good.
  Negative
