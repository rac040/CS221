David Thorpes documentary, Do I Sound Gay?is a bit less blunt than its title, but it is just as provocative.
  Positive
It explores the notion of ones voice being a signifier for ones sexuality, raising some interesting observations about why that is, and whether it is even true.
  Positive
The film scratches a lot of surfaces, never venturing too far down the interesting paths it divulges.
  Negative
However, what it does explore makes it a satisfying, lighthearted look at one mans search for perceived vocal machismo.
  Neutral
Up front, Thorpe admits that many gay men affect aspects of what could be considered the standard gay voice.
  Negative
He recalls a visit to Fire Island where, en route, he noticed how his fellow commuters spoke.
  Negative
In some ways, the similarities in everyones cadences annoyed him.
  Negative
Making matters worse, he has just broken up with a boyfriend who decided he wanted someone more straight-sounding than anybody on the train, Thorpe included.
  Negative
As examples of the kind of voice Thorpe is discussing, Do I Sound Gay?
  Negative
brings in  Paul Lynde and  Charles Nelson Reilly.
  Positive
The former delivers a Hollywood Squares punchline thats as politically incorrect as it is hilarious, and the latter is seen rolling his eyes and antagonizing Brett Sommers on Match Game.Since TV wouldnt allow blatant homosexual displays back then, I always thought Lynde, Reilly and others used their voices as a subversive way of communicating with LGBT members who watched them.
  Positive
They were also able to get away with verbal murder simply because of the way they sounded they could say almost anything.
  Neutral
This particular aspect of their voices remains curiously unexplored by Thorpe, though I sense it might be a reason why one would mimic their manner of speaking.
  Negative
Do I Sound Gay?
  Neutral
does ask some thought-provoking questions about where this particular gay-sounding voice comes from: Is it a subconscious mimicry of the female voices of ones relatives?
  Positive
Is it a means of telegraphing so that other gay men know of ones existence?
  Neutral
And is a lisp an early indicator of homosexuality?
  Neutral
One interviewee jokes that his speech therapy classmates proved that it is.
  Positive
Thorpe asks celebrities like  David Sedaris and Dan Savage about these ideas, getting candid responses from each about whether they believe they sound gay.
  Negative
Sedaris makes a memorable, stinging observation about the conflicted feelings that occur when one is misidentified as straight.
  Positive
To get some professional answers, Thorpe enlists a speech coach who will serve as more than just a research reference.
  Negative
Because of the ex-boyfriend debacle, Thorpe decides to alter his voice in the hopes of sounding less perceptibly gay.
  Negative
The speech coach listens to his voice, then sets out to help him not only deepen it, but to lose all the indicators of whats considered a gay voice.
  Negative
She trains him to change vowel and consonant sounds you hold them too long, she says at one point, and gives him flash cards to practice with at home.
  Negative
We hear Thorpe practicing several times, and for a while Do I Sound Gay?
  Negative
seems primed to end with the vocal equivalent of the sports movie big game clich: Will Thorpe successfully pull off sounding more macho than  John Wayne?
  Negative
And will he use his new voice talents to find a man?
  Positive
Of course, you already know how this is going to end.
  Neutral
Do I Sound Gay?
  Neutral
is a paean to LGBT self-acceptance regardless of how one sounds.
  Positive
Despite the predictability of its outcome, this is still a worthwhile documentary.
  Positive
Thorpe is an engaging presence, and he gets really good sound bites from his interviewees, including  George Takei and, most shockingly, Don Lemon.
  Very positive
Thorpe also keeps things moving, clocking in at a way-too-short  minutes.
  Positive
Though were not given enough material to draw a solid theoretical conclusion about why someone would evaluate sexuality based on voice alone, the film still twists the viewers arm, forcing one to question ones own ideas about whether the human voice has telltale signs.
  Negative
It also challenges your own thoughts about whether sounding gay is a bad thing in this day and age, and may even make you ponder the titular question for yourself.
