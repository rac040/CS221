In addition to a being packaged with a virtual reality experience at selected theaters, Notes on Blindness is being released in formats for blind and sighted audiences.
  Negative
I wish Id been sent the former version.
  Negative
I just wanted to close my eyes and listen to the films realistic sounds and the narration by its subject, theologian John Hull.
  Neutral
Hull made an acclaimed series of audio journal entries detailing how he coped with losing his sight.
  Negative
His work received several commendations from organizations for the blind, and it makes for powerful, compelling listening.
  Positive
Butthe central conceit of Notes on Blindness is to emulate Hulls descent into blindness using visuals.
  Negative
When directors  Pete Middleton and  James Spinney do clever things like keeping bits of information and action off-screen while we hear Hulls frustration over having to ask for descriptions of whats happening, the film achieves its goal.
  Positive
But quite often, the filmmakers go for blurry scenery, surreal events and odd camera shots that feel more like gimmicks than an accurate representation of its subjects affliction.
  Negative
My problems with overcoming the Uncanny Valley effect of the films gimmickry may stem from the fact thatI am half-blind.
  Negative
I lost the vision in my left eye due to a retinal detachment when I was .
  Negative
So Hulls discussions about ripped retinas and botched eye surgeries resonated greatly with me.
  Negative
And though I have a decent amount of sight in my good eye, I fully understood Hulls initial unwillingness to accept his new condition.
  Negative
I felt the same way, and my similar fears were supported by the knowledge that my family is genetically predisposed to losing our vision.
  Negative
Its more a destination than an option for us.
  Positive
So Hulls story was indeed inspiring to me.
  Positive
He continued to teach at the university he worked at pre-blindness, and he was devoted to bridging the gap of understanding between the sighted and the unsighted world until his death in .
  Negative
But I couldnt fully abide by the rules Notes on Blindness played by, though I suspect I may be in the minority here.
  Negative
One thing that does work very well is the onscreen re-enactments of several journal entries by actors Dan Skinner and  Simone Kirby, who lip-sync to Hull's and his wife, Marilyns voices.
  Neutral
This could have very easily been a distraction, but Skinner is excellent and Kirby practically vibrates with love for her onscreen husband.
  Positive
When Hull says on the soundtrack that, for the first time, he felt completely useless, Skinner nails the moment onscreen.
  Negative
There are also a few effective scenes with the child actors playing the Hull children' their inquiries about their fathers blindness are answered in a loving, supportive manner.
  Positive
Hulls journal entries contain enough memorable moments to warrant seeking them out.
  Negative
A meeting with a faith healer takes an unexpected turn.
  Positive
And Hulls visit to his parents back in Australia begets the most haunting passages used in the film.
  Positive
He acknowledges that losing his sight has caused him to forget what many once-familiar things looked like, and this is especially distressing once he returns to his childhood home.
  Negative
The powerful nostalgia of his youth has slipped away, disappearing along with his vision.
  Positive
Notes on Blindness has won several awards since its Sundance Film Festival premiere.
  Positive
If the subject interests you, dont let my mildly negative review dissuade you from going to see it.
  Negative
I would like to see it again myself, but this time in the version I can share with several of my relatives whose vision is no longer present.
  Positive
I really think Id like that version more, and Id love to hear what my family thinks of It too.
  Negative
But you can keep the VR element.
  Positive
It cant compete with the real thing for me.
