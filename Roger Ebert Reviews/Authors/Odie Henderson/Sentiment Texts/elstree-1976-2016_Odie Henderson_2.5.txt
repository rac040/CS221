Watching Elstree ," I was reminded of a question that occasionally arose on the Siskel amp' Ebert TV show.
  Positive
During a particularly negative review, Gene would ask Roger, Is this film more interesting than a documentary of the actors having lunch?
  Negative
I've always wanted to see that alternate movie Gene mentioned.
  Neutral
Now I feel that I have, because Elstree  plays like the  Star Wars equivalent of that lunchtime documentary, except the actors around the table arent the films most famous players.
  Negative
Instead, the people profiled are known primarily by diehard fans who attend "Star Wars" conventions.
  Neutral
Director  Jon Spiras goal is to bring these lesser known character actors to the forefront and discuss what theyre doing today.
  Positive
This is a where are they now?
  Neutral
-style feature that might have you asking but where were they then?
  Neutral
The answer is behind various masks, helmets and prosthetics, all of which hid or partially obscured the performers faces.
  Negative
One of the actors profiled is in "Star Wars" for one shot.
  Positive
Another is in the same scene as two different characters, and yet another is entirely on the cutting room floor, his footage the stuff of legend until the advent of YouTube made it available for all to see.
  Negative
Elstree  also gives screen time to  David Prowse, the man behind the most famous masked Star Wars character, Darth Vader.
  Positive
The films title refers to the North London suburb that served as one of Star Warss filming locations.
  Neutral
In ,  George Lucas cast a number of Stormtroopers, X-Wing fighter pilots, security guards, friends of Luke and even a monster named Greedo, who clearly didnt shoot first.
  Negative
Assigned to these roles were British character actors, all of whom had careers in the U.K. or Canada before getting the casting call for a galaxy far, far away.
  Negative
Some had been Shakespearean actors beforehand, while others had TV series roles, modeling careers or appearances as extras in other films.
  Negative
Before he was Lord Vader, the  tall Prowse had a memorable role in Kubricks A Clockwork Orange and a bodybuilding career cut short by the judges hatred of his ugly feet.
  Negative
Another actor, X-Wing pilot  Garrick Hagon, had previously worked on stage with Obi-Wan himself,  Alec Guinness.
  Negative
Everyone tells their Star Wars stories, and Spina uses footage from the film as supplements.
  Positive
We see  Paul Blakes Greedo get blown away by Han Solo and  Anthony Forrests part in the aforementioned cutting room floor footage.
  Negative
Forrest is also revealed to be the Stormtrooper recipient of the Jedi Mind Trick.
  Neutral
Pam Rose is shown in her cantina scene and  Jeremy Bulloch shows up late in the film to discuss his role as Boba Fett.
  Negative
Even the gaffe of the Stormtrooper hitting his head in the Death Star gets highlighted here, with the actor underneath the mask telling us what happened.
  Negative
By now, you are probably asking, "Why anyone would want to hear the stories of these people, some of whom have no lines or have their faces covered to the point of full obscurity?"
  Negative
And I have to admit, I asked myself the same question before watching.
  Negative
Its because this is "Star Wars," a movie series that has had  billion fine-toothed combs run through it by hungry fans eager to devour every morsel of it, no matter how infinitesimal.
  Negative
Several of the talking heads in Elstree  appear at conventions, where the lines to see them have -minute wait times.
  Negative
And Im not just talking about Prowse or Bulloch, either.
  Negative
If you were just in the frame of a shot, people will want to talk to you.
  Positive
This is a level of fandom thats too deep even for a compulsive like me, and I was there on "Star Wars" opening day in .
  Negative
So, at  minutes, Elstree  became a bit of a slog for me.
  Negative
Visually, the talking heads-style of the documentary can be very dull.
  Negative
But two things almost save the film.
  Neutral
The first is that the filmmakers intended to make more than a "Star Wars" documentary.
  Neutral
The big takeaway from this movie is how strange life can be if you happen to be in the right place at the right time.
  Negative
None of the actors on display here had any clue of the worldwide phenomenon "Star Wars" would become.
  Negative
And I doubt you can name another movie where a bit player can be showered with love and affection by fans excited to meet them, even if the actors face never appeared onscreen.
  Positive
The second thing is that I really grew to like these people.
  Negative
Theres an intimacy to the stories of their personal lives before and after their "Star Wars" experiences.
  Positive
The great critic Bilge Ebiri called this film the 'Rosencrantz amp' Guildenstern are Dead' of the ' Star Wars' Universe," and its an apt description.
  Negative
Youre hearing some good stories told from the viewpoints of minor characters.
  Positive
This will hold your attention best if you are a "Star Wars" completist or a super-fan.
  Positive
Add half a star to my rating if you are.
  Negative
