Students of high school or university psychology classes are probably familiar with the Stanford Prison Experiment.
  Negative
Run in  at the behest of the U.S. Navy, the experiment intended to investigate the cause of conflict between guards and prisoners in military correctional facilities.
  Negative
Dr. Philip Zimbardo and his team chose  male Stanford students and divvied them up into guards and prisoners.
  Negative
Turning the basement of one of the student halls into a makeshift prison, Zimbardo placed his subjects under surveillance and watched as the prisoners became passive and the guards exhibited authority by way of sometimes sadistic psychological torture.
  Negative
Zimbardo ended the experiment  days into its -week run, mostly due to the objections of his fiance.
  Negative
She felt Zimbardo had become an unhealthy part of his own experiment.
  Positive
A documentary about this could potentially be fascinating, as some of the actual experiment exists on film.
  Positive
Unfortunately, The Stanford Prison Experiment is a dramatization, and no matter how much it may adhere to the well-documented specifics of Zimbardos work, it is a massive failure.
  Very negative
It prefers to abstract the experiment from any psychological theories or details, opting instead to merely harp on endless, repetitive scenes of prisoner abuse.
  Negative
One particular guard, who thinks hes  Strother Martin in  Cool Hand Luke, abuses the prisoners.
  Negative
The prisoners take the abuse, rebelling once or twice before becoming passive.
  Negative
Zimbardo glares at a TV screen doing nothing while his guards break the rules of the contract everybody signed at the outset.
  Negative
Repeat ad nauseum.
  Neutral
These scenes are supposed to shock the viewer, but they did not work for me, because I just didnt care.The film reduces the entire experiment to a Dead Teenager movie whose slasher just roughs them up.
  Negative
Prisoners are referred to by numbers in order to strip them of their personal identities, and the film keeps them at this level of distance.
  Negative
We never get to know any subject outside of brief sketches, so the victims become disposable.
  Negative
Despite the best efforts of the actors on both sides of the law, the film is completely clinical in its depiction, striking the same note for over  hours.
  Negative
It gets real dull, real fast.
  Negative
I didnt care because this isnt remotely like an actual prison' its a bunch of privileged kids playing dress-up for  a day.
  Negative
Even a priest Zimbardo hires as a prison chaplain tells the doctor its good that these privileged kids experience prison life.
  Positive
The actual reasons for the experiment and its military involvement are never expressed in  Tim Talbotts screenplay, so the priests comment almost serves as the reason for these tests.
  Negative
And the film takes great pains to tell us that nobody in the experiment suffered long term psychological damage after it was abruptly cancelled.
  Negative
Im sure someone who hasexperienced the harsh realities of actual prison life would feel relieved that these young men werent scarred.
  Negative
The best scene in The Stanford Prison Experiment deals with an actual prisoner and serves to highlight my disdain for how the film trades emotion and details for exploitative shocks.
  Negative
The fantastic  Nelsan Ellis last seen in  Get On Up plays Jesse, an ex-con brought in by Zimbardos team as an expert witness to their proceedings.
  Positive
At a mock parole board hearing, Jesse rips into an inmate, treating him as inhumanely as possible while verbally shredding the inmates explanation for why he should be paroled.
  Negative
After the stunned inmate is sent back to his cell, Jesse reveals that he was recreating his own parole board treatment.
  Negative
He tells Zimbardo that playing the role of his own tormentor felt good, and I hated that it did.
  Positive
This, in a nutshell, is what the actual experiment sought to explore, that is, the nature of even the nicest human beings to commit evil.
  Positive
Jesses revelation, and the psychological toll it takes on him, is more effective than anything else the film conjures up.
  Positive
If only the movie had spent more time interacting with the Strother Martin-wannabes own thoughts rather than trudging him out only for sadism.
  Negative
The film reduces Zimbardo to some kind of megalomaniac who doesnt know what he is doing.
  Negative
This makes his research seem half-assed and unethical.
  Negative
He watches the guards strike the prisoners a direct violation of the rules and the film paints him as the biggest villain of all.
  Negative
He challenges anyone who questions his methods and authority, and at one point, he absurdly sits in a hallway like a low-rent  Charles Bronson hoping for the return of a subject who might jeopardize his research.
  Negative
In the actual case, Zimbardo simply moves the prison to a location unknown by the subject.
  Negative
And though his intentions are to feminize the prisoners by giving them dresses that barely hide their genitalia, The Stanford Prison Experiment implies that Zimbardos sole reason for stopping the experiment was the moment when his guards forced the inmates into a gay sex pantomime.
  Negative
Violence and hog-tying inmates were OK, but none of that gay stuff, the movie seems to say.
  Negative
Billy Crudup deserves some kind of medal for his attempt to breathe life into his one dimensional character, as do actors like  Ezra Miller and  Olivia Thirlby.
  Negative
But they are undermined by a poor script, horror movie-style music and ripe dramatizations that exist solely to make the viewer feel superior.
  Negative
I despise movies like this and  Compliance because they pretend to say something profound about their scenarios but are, at heart, cynically manipulative trash designed to make audiences pat themselves on the back for not being like those people.
  Very negative
Had we been forced to identify with anyone, prisoner or guard, the film might have achieved the palpable discomfort of forcing us to look at ourselves.
  Negative
That was one of the goals of the actual Stanford Prison Experiment.
  Neutral
This movie just wants to superficially disturb, and its not even successful at that.
  Negative
