If those little yellow creatures from  Despicable Me and its sequel drove you bananas, youll find no respite at Minions, the third chapter in the series.
  Negative
Gru and his adopted daughters are nowhere to be found, nor are Pharrell Williams catchy songs.
  Negative
Instead, Grus loyal sidekicks step into the spotlight, underscored by a 's era, Beatles-heavy soundtrack that must have cost a fortune in rights.
  Negative
Guided and voiced by co-director  Pierre Coffin, theminionspecies earns an origin story that begins in the primordial soup and ends  years B.G. Before Gru.
  Negative
Since Minions removes the emotional anchors of this series, one might assume that it is a heartless cash grab perpetrated by the greedy folks at Universal.
  Negative
And your assumption would be wrong, because this movie isnt heartless.
  Negative
Minions is relentless, however, and in more ways than one.
  Negative
Its relentless in its depiction of the slapstick-infused shenanigans that will keep the little ones entranced in their seats.
  Negative
Then, sensing the duress that parents were under when their aforementioned crumbsnatchers demanded to see it, the film relentlessly throws every single oldies station pop and rock song it can find at the speakers.
  Negative
Minions opens with The Turtles Happy Together, ends post-credits with The Beatles Revolution and finds time for a number from  Hair that threatens to end the way Act  of that musical did.
  Positive
If that werent enough, the voice talent includes "Mad Men"s  Jon Hamm, "Birdman"s  Michael Keaton and  Sandra Bullock as Grus villainous precursor, the delectably named Scarlett Overkill.
  Negative
Before we get to evil Sandy Bullock, our narrator a droll  Geoffrey Rush takes us through the evolution of theminion.
  Negative
They climbed out of the soup to serve T-Rexes, pharaohs and even Napoleon, who banished them to Antarctica after an unfortunate cannon accident.
  Negative
Fed up with their frigid existence,minionleader Kevin sets out to find a new master for his brethren.
  Positive
He asks for volunteers and gets one-eyed Stuart and goofy runt Bob, who is small even byminionstandards.
  Negative
On their journey, this cute trio occasionally breaks into song, singing in that nonsense mix of Spanish, French, and God knows what else Coffin utters for them.
  Positive
I understood some of their dialogue, which scared the hell out of me.
  Negative
Their lack of an identifiable dialect may be one reason Minions will do gangbusters overseas.
  Negative
This is a film where dubbing of its main characters will prove unnecessary.
  Negative
This is also why, out of all the Despicable Me films, Minions is the most suited for the youngest of moviegoers.
  Negative
Theminionmission is to reach the  Villain-Con conference, where they can hook up with eligible baddies.
  Negative
Their first stop is a gorgeously rendered New York City.
  Positive
From there, they hitch a ride to Orlando with a family of bank robbers ledby Keaton and  Alison Janney.
  Positive
They makes the most of their short screen time, bringing a lively delivery to their lines before the film executes a hilarious clothing sight gag.
  Positive
Keaton and Janney are a lot more fun than Scarlett Overkill, whose goal is also robbery but of a more royal variety.
  Positive
When it comes to defining characteristics, Overkill could have used more of her surname.
  Negative
Despite a great entrance that highlights Bullocks best line reading in the film, shes an incredibly bland villain.
  Negative
Her reputation precedes her shes touted as the ne plus ultra of villainy but all she seems to do is yell.
  Negative
Since theminions main purpose in life is to serve the worlds most evil masters, Scarlett is their Mount Everest.
  Negative
Shes looking for newminionsto help her steal the crown jewels and become Queen of England, so Kevin and his crew eagerly sign up for the audition.
  Negative
Unfortunately for Kevin and company, Queen Elizabeth II wont be an easy victim.
  Negative
Shes a lot more spry in  than shell be in .
  Neutral
She clobbers theminionsin their first meeting.
  Positive
The Queen also comes off as more Swingin Sixties babe than the Oscar-winning  Helen Mirren portrayal, though I suppose she could be channeling the  version of Helen Mirren.
  Negative
In the role,  Jennifer Saunders is absolutely fabulous' along with its colorful attention to its famous locales, shes the movies secret weapon.
  Positive
I can only imagine how the second half jabs at all things British will play in the U.K., but like everything else in Minions, they come as a fast and furious series of non-stop gags.
  Negative
The film ends with the appearance of a famous character from the series, which can be read as either the biggest fan pander or the set-up for yet another prequel that will bridge the gap between Minions and Despicable Me.
  Negative
Id like to see that movie.
  Neutral
In fact, that story should have been the plot ofthismovie.
  Negative
No matter, for we must play the hand we are dealt.
  Neutral
The unquenchable desire to please emanating from the screen is, quite frankly, exhausting.
  Negative
Minions is a big, slobbery dog who licks your face, brings your slippers and humps your leg before turning into an adorable kitten with big eyes and a soulful mew.
  Positive
And, so help me, I couldnt stay mad at it for long.
  Negative
Every time it got aggravating, it would immediately do something that made me smile and forgive it.
  Negative
Bear in mind that, as my " Despicable Me " review mentioned, Im a bigminionsfan.
  Negative
Fandom is a pre-requisite for this movie, and if youre not a fan, your kids probably are.
  Negative
Grin and bear it for them, because like that Pharrell song from the last movie, Minions is probably going to be inescapable.
  Very negative
