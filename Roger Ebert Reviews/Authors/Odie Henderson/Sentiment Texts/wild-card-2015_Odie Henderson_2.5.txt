Jason Statham movies arent known for their dialogue.
  Neutral
People attend his films for their action sequences, which is why so few filmmakers give Statham much to say.
  Neutral
Thats a shame, because when given the rare chance to be chatty, Statham becomes more than just a lethal weapon.
  Negative
Wild Card gives him more opportunities to converse than to clobber, and as odd as this may sound, I really enjoyed listening to Statham talk.
  Positive
His fight scenes have their predictable, violent payoffs, but his rambling monologues are unexpectedly, gloriously entertaining.
  Positive
This films tagline should be Come for the stabbing, stay for the gabbing!
  Negative
With Wild Card, screenwriter  William Goldman takes a third crack at the story of Nick the Vegas chaperone.
  Positive
Goldman wrote the source novel and a  film adaptation starring  Burt Reynolds, both of which were called Heat.
  Neutral
Had the  version starred  Bruce Willis instead of Reynolds, Wild Card would be redundant: Stathams take on Nick evokes Willis in his prime.
  Negative
Hes as quick to cut a villain down with a quip as he is with a sharp object, and a gloomy raincloud of vulnerability seems to perpetually hang over his head.
  Negative
Details of Nicks former life are left vague, though one can assume he has an intimate knowledge of all things violent.
  Negative
His current incarnation is a friendly British chap who does favors for people.
  Positive
Everyone we encounter mentions these favors, and how indebted they are to Nick.
  Negative
His latest assignment requires him to get beaten to a pulp by a pudgy, balding guy trying to impress  Sofia Vergara.
  Negative
The ruse works, and Nick gets  for his troubles.
  Positive
The money helps finance his eventual escape from Las Vegas.
  Positive
Nicks desired getaway locale, Corsica, appears in brief flashbacks that look like Ralph Lauren ads.
  Very negative
Nicks next assignment involves the battered woman dumped out of a car in Wild Cards first scene.
  Negative
Shes Holly Dominik Garcia-Lorido, an escort who once loved Nick.
  Positive
When he hit rock bottom, she nursed him back to health.
  Negative
Now she wants Nick to help her find the man who brutally raped her before his henchmen left her for dead at the hospital.
  Neutral
Since Nick knows everyone in the underbelly of Vegas, including a kingpin named Baby  Stanley Tucci, he easily finds the guilty party.
  Negative
Sadistic Mafioso Danny DeMarco  Milo Ventimiglia and his henchmen cross paths with Nick at DeMarcos hotel suite, ushering in the first instance of Statham doing what you paid to see him do.
  Negative
Rather than kill Danny, Nick merely roughs him up, paving the way for Holly to exact a humiliating, though non-lethal vengeance on Dannys most prized possession.
  Negative
For his troubles, Nick is paid , in hush money from Dannys stash.
  Negative
As Holly rides off into an avenged sunset, Nick heads for the nearest blackjack table to attempt the final big score that will hasten his exit from Sin City.
  Negative
The movie is about  minutes old.
  Neutral
Its here that we realize that Wild Card is two parts The Gambler and three parts  The Equalizer.
  Positive
Its better at the former than it is the latter.
  Neutral
Statham reeks of a compulsive desperation  Mark Wahlberg cant touch, and director  Simon West films the big high stakes gambling sequence with a white-knuckled excitement sorely missing from Wahlbergs remake.
  Positive
It helps that the wonderful  Hope Davis plays Nicks friend and dealer, Cassandra.
  Very positive
Davis does more with a sympathetic glance than pages of exposition could describe.
  Neutral
Theres another assignment for Nick, and Goldman uses it as a rather sloppy way of tying all his plot threads together.
  Negative
A rich, -year old software developer named Cyrus Kinnick  Michael Angarano, channeling a young  Matthew Broderick wants to pay Nick to teach him how to be brave.
  Negative
Show tunes and the return of a very angry, slightly mutilated Danny DeMarco figure in Cyrus lessons.
  Negative
Theres also a fight scene set to the Drifters version of White Christmas, a mobster summit that hinges on seeing a characters penis and Statham finding a use for teaspoons and butter knives that Emily Post wouldnt endorse but  Quentin Tarantino would.
  Negative
Throughout, Statham expertly handles Goldmans sometimes absurd dialogue.
  Negative
The film is at its best when Nick chats with people.
  Positive
Wild Card wisely casts its supporting characters with actors who leave an impression, including Davis dealer,  Anne Heches diner waitress,  Davenia McFaddens information-gathering maid,  Jason Alexanders office mate and Tuccis head honcho, Baby.
  Negative
The folks in Nicks orbit form a self-contained society with its own set of rules and regulations.
  Negative
Wild Card has a finely tuned sense of the Vegas working-class, of people who are off the beaten path, hustling in the harsh light of day that most tourists sleep through.
  Positive
Its kind of a shame that the film feels compelled to interrupt this feeling with violence.
  Negative
Theres less than you might be expecting, and Id be remiss if I didnt say those scenes are fun in the most gratuitously brutal ways one guy gets gruesomely slashed with a credit card.
  Negative
But youve seen Statham do all that before, and it clashes with the novel-like vibe Goldman successfully creates.
  Positive
Perhaps thats why movies give Statham little to say: His gift of gab overshadows his penchant for mayhem.
  Negative
