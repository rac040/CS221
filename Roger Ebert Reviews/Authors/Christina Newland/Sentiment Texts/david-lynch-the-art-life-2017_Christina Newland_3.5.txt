From  HitchcockTruffaut to  De Palma, the film director has been a figure of fascination for documentarians as of late.
  Negative
For cinephiles, these auteur-focused documentaries hit a sweet spot and for the newcomer, they can double as an introductory lesson in film studies.
  Positive
David Lynch: The Art Life may initially appear to be in the same vein as the aforementioned docs, but much like the director himself its of weirder and less accessible stock.
  Negative
Jon Nguyens film, made with a remarkable amount of cooperation and openness from the usually enigmatic Lynch, observes the man while he talks about his formative years, sloshes paint around in his studio in the Hollywood Hills, and plays with his toddler daughter, Lula.
  Positive
Still, this is less a play-by-play of his film career than it is a look into Lynchs lopsided worldview.
  Negative
Most of his major works, from  Blue Velvet to  Mulholland Dr., are scarcely given a mention.
  Negative
Rather, the focus is on Lynchs early life and the experiences which shaped him.
  Negative
He and his siblings grew up travelling from one pleasant middle-class suburb to the next for his fathers career as a research scientist.
  Positive
He grew up nervous, eccentric, and sensitive an aspiring artist who bounced around East Coast cities and art schools without ever fully finding his niche.
  Negative
It wasnt until he turned to film winning an AFI grant to study and work in California that the beginnings of what would be Eraserhead began to come to fruition.
  Positive
As Lynch shares keenly-recalled adolescent memories in voice-over, Nguyen illustrates with a mixture of grainy mm footage from the directors youth and contemporary film of the older Lynch pottering around in his studio.
  Positive
Also included are montages of Lynchs sketches and paintings' often deeply disturbing and confessional.
  Negative
Painting was the directors first passion and driving ambition.
  Negative
One day, apropos of nothing, he hallucinated that one of his paintings was "in motion" and he was inspired to try out animation.
  Negative
Hallucination seems like a fitting start to a film career like Lynchs.
  Negative
And when the director speaks, one gets the sense that even his happiest childhood memories have the stain of the bizarre on them.
  Negative
Although Lynch describes a loving and traditional family upbringing in cheerfully bright Midwestern suburbs, his mind always seems to skew toward the shadow.
  Negative
At one point in the film, as he holds forth in his typically stilted manner, he tells a seemingly mundane anecdote.
  Negative
Before the Lynch family were moving away, they shared a sweet goodbye to their neighbors, the Smiths.
  Positive
But something suggests that their friendly idyll seems to have been broken.
  Neutral
Mr. Smith was bidding them farewell, and then ... I cant tell the story, Lynch says mysteriously, mid-sentence.
  Negative
The way he finds the sinister in the most innocuous of stories is striking largely because this is a prominent theme in so many of his films.
  Positive
In another story, seemingly placed into Blue Velvet directly from memory, Lynch describes happily playing with friends on his neighborhood street when a woman stark naked, hysterical, and bleeding from the mouth emerged from the nearby woods and sat down on the curb nearby, weeping.
  Negative
Being children, they were frightened and unsure of where she came from a local mental hospital, or some more terrible place of confinement and abuse?
  Negative
He describes the experience as "otherworldly" and its not hard to imagine that such a jarring incident would stick out in anyones memory.
  Negative
In spite of these stories, Lynchs essence is still slippery and undefinable.
  Negative
He describes dark, fantastic dreams and big emotions from his younger years, or the rationale of his kind but straight-and-narrow parents, but, for the most part, the rest must be read between the lines.
  Positive
One of the more revealing moments comes when he describes his first weeks alone in an apartment before starting college in Boston.
  Positive
His apprehension about leaving the room became so great that he found himself paralyzed in a chair with only a transistor radio for company.
  Positive
He would get up to eat and then return to his seat for a solid two-week stretch.
  Negative
Clearly, these are not the sort of "movie magic" anecdotes we might get from  Brian De Palma, laughing about the shoot-out scenes in  Scarface.
  Negative
And for that reason, The Art Life may have a considerably narrower target audience.
  Negative
But this cockeyed, oblique attempt to get closer to the worldview of David Lynch one of American cinemas finest oddities is a compelling slice of cinephile inquiry.
  Positive
