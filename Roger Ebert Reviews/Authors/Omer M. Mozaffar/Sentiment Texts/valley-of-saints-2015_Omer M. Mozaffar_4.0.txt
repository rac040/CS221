Musa Syeeds first feature, Valley of Saints is a quiet tapestry of such colorful beauty that it had me sighing and smiling through every scene.
  Positive
Set in the waters of Dal Lake Kashmir, it takes us through the life of Gulzar Gulzar Ahmed Bhatt, who plans to secretly escape his homeland with his best friend Afzal  Mohammed Afzal.
  Negative
He meets a scientist namedAsifa  Neelofar Hamid, and has to decide.
  Negative
At one level, this is a classic love triangle: a man competes with his best friend for a womans attention.
  Positive
At another, this is a film weve never seen before: Syeed explores the heart of a rarely visited landscape, and the souls of the resilient Kashmiri people.
  Positive
This is an amazing film.
  Very positive

The shikaras are cousins of Italian gondolas: long slender, two-seated wooden boats, used to taxi tourists through the lake.
  Negative
Gulzar offers rides to visitors through the tranquil setting.
  Positive
Because of political problems, however, the industry suffers, so their opportunities suffer.
  Negative
Afzal arrives and the two spend their evening together singing, hugging, playing.
  Negative
These are two friends whose love far exceeds any Hollywood bromance, where such tight friendships seem to end with grade school.
  Negative
The two here are one in love, or something deeper.
  Positive
They remind me that a friendship is possible that reaches such a depth that love is not a sufficient adjective.
  Positive
It is as though modernity coerces us to skimp on friendship, though the struggles of modernity nationalist wars orphaned them, bringing them together in the first place.
  Negative
And, then they meet Asifa.
  Neutral
Asifa is an American-trained researcher exploring pollution levels throughout the lake.
  Negative
She is, at first, cold and abrasive to these gentlemen, and that ignites their attraction to her.
  Positive
She is a perfect contrast to them.
  Positive
They are two men rather, boys from a small, sheltered idyllic world trying to break out.
  Negative
She is an expat who has traveled the globe, now returning home to see the environment beneath the greenery, seeing the second side to Kashmir.
  Positive
If a place on the earth can lay claim to paradise, it is Kashmir, and if there is a place that embodies all the dark consequences of humanity, it too is Kashmir.
  Negative
It is a special land of forced contradictions.
  Positive
It is full of colossal green mountains.
  Neutral
Dal Lake is blanketed by lily pads.
  Negative
The people themselves have distinct features' their beauty and quiet almost zen like calm makes them distinct from their fellows across the Subcontinent.
  Positive
But, because of its scenic majesty and location, Kashmir is the subject of a generations long tug-of-war between India and Pakistan.
  Negative
The result, in the film, is an uprising taking place a block away, between separatists throwing rocks and soldiers firing bullets.
  Positive
If that is not enough, the neighborhoods feel like shanty towns filling up the lake with discarded paper and plastic, making much of the water poisonous.
  Negative
There is something complex in Musa Syeeds direction that captures so many contrasts and so many layers.
  Positive
Almost all the performers are non-actors, perfectly cast as simple people with tender dreams, navigating life within a larger narrative far stronger and forceful than they themselves are.
  Positive
They exude a tenderness in disposition and tone that quickly draws our attention and sympathy.
  Positive
The sets are fascinating.
  Positive
Some of the buildings are such ornate wood-carved structures that Syeed gives us just enough to get a flavorful taste.
  Negative
Others, however, are so functional and repulsive that we feel the oppositions in the juxtapositions.
  Negative
Most of all, he has a skill in capturing the quiet moments in life, inviting us to share in the serenity.
  Positive
The film works as a deep commentary on noise, where silence represents all of our ideals and noise represents the shattering of that mythic perfection.
  Positive
The lakes only sound is the trickle of water, sometimes interrupted by the shikara oars.
  Negative
Meanwhile, guns blast from the rifles of fully armed guards, just minutes away.
  Negative
As tensions rise between Gulzar and Afzal, they too fight, splashing the water, removing the calm.
  Negative
All in all, the default sound of the environment is still a deep, almost inviting silence.
  Positive
Meaning, against all the decay, our ideals persist.
  Negative
In the end, as Gulzar and Afzal try to run away, they have to choose between their loves.
  Negative
Is it the love for each other that helps them escape?
  Positive
Are they held back by love for their withering homeland that once seemed to be protected by saints?
  Negative
Or, is there something else?
  Neutral
Syeeds film is a most ambitious, most intimate picture about a most persistent, most modest people.
  Very positive
