  Positive
As he drives on his first assignment, his car hits a stray dog, and from there, the story unravels.
  Negative
The dog here is, for Syeed, a conscious choice as opposed to a cat.
  Negative
Many Muslims regard dogs as so filthy that they do not let them in their homes.
  Negative
Adan has a moment of pause when he has to pick up the dog, but takes him on what becomes a sort of road movie through Minneapolis, looking for a home and a way to part from the dog.
  Negative

  Negative
There is a sequence in the Coen Brothers  Inside Llewyn Davis, in which the title character has to handle a runaway cat, which plays comically.

  Negative
Syeed takes us deep into the communities, showing us exactly what we should expect: people making ends meet while they find their place in their new world.
  Positive
The neighbors are friendly, unlike the overall immigration and security agencies which discard refugees until they spy on them.
  Positive
Films exploring the foreign tend to be exploitative, emphasizing stereotypes, or they tend to be anthropological exercises by liberal westerners exploring the savages.
  Negative
Despite my extensive experience across Muslim America, I have not spent time in these Somali communities.
  Negative
Syeeds work, however, provides a sense of authenticity, through casual conversations, close-ups that are not preceded by establishing shots that soon reveal elements off-screen, and attention to small details, as though we are present in these worlds as much as we are watching them.
  Negative
In addition to being a tender film about a man finding redemption in caring for a canine, Syeeds pious film is refreshing, showing us a corner of America that we never see.
  Positive
