Last year I was briefly in Reykjavik, so briefly that my husband and I elected to do the tourist thing and board a bus tour so we could see a bit of the country.
  Very negative
As the bus rounded a long slope from which I could see several steaming geysers, our guide said that Iceland was a young country so young, in fact, that if you thought of the earth's age as a -hour day, Iceland had been formed in the last seconds of the day.
  Negative
You could see that, he said, in all of the geological fixtures that seemed, to my eyes, a bit frightening: fissures between tectonic plates, gorgeous and deadly waterfalls, jagged cliffs, streams of scalding water shooting from the ground.
  Negative
Perhaps it was a baby landscape, newly born, but it also seemed like a place of primal fury that would just as soon kill you as swaddle you.
  Negative
The tour guide's metaphor thrummed in my mind as we let ourselves get dampened by the steam emanating from cracks in the earth, as we snapped pictures of plants growing in hardened lava flows, as we soaked in a mineral bath surrounded by volcanoes thathadn't erupted in a while: the geological violence that occurs to generate and regenerate the planet.
  Negative
Life, both sacred and cruel, in a cycle punctuated by apocalypse.
  Negative
From the modern world, bent to human existence, it's easy to romanticize that cycle ifyou're not chained to its spokes.
  Negative
But in his stunning debut film, Ixcanul,  Jayro Bustamante indulges in no romance.
  Negative
A mesmerizing, understated tragedy set far from Iceland but in a place shadowed by the same geological reality Ixcanul is the first film made in the Kaqchikel Mayan language and was Guatemala's entry into the Academy Awards last year.
  Positive
Ixcanul is named for the active volcano on which teenaged Mara  Mara Mercedes Coroy lives with her parents  Mara Teln and  Manuel Antn in a small village.
  Negative
They grow coffee and live on the volcano's slopes, mostly isolated from the modern world.
  Negative
Mara has been promised in marriage to Ignacio  Justo Lorenzo, a supervisor, but she wants to run away with Pepe  Marvin Coroy, who is headed for the United States.
  Negative
She is fascinated with stories of America.
  Positive
It's where she wants to be.
  Neutral
In an effort to secure Pepe's desire to have her run away with him, Mara finds him one night as he's drinking heavily with the other village men and easily convinces him to have sex with her.
  Negative
Pregnancy results.
  Neutral
From there, things begin to get complicated for Mara, forcing her into an almost unbelievably unjust confrontation with the modern world aplot point that is based on the real-life, ongoing exploitation of indigenous people in Guatemala, according to Bustamante.
  Negative
Ixcanul combines its fable-like plot with striking realism.
  Positive
Shot luminously by  Luis Armando Arteaga, each frame holds steady on its subject, inviting the audience to calmly observer the daily routines and customs of its subjects in saturated colors that seem almost to glow.
  Positive
They harvest coffee, cook dinner, bathe, kiss, discuss pregnancy in terms of traditional medicine.
  Negative
Bustamante leaves out exposition, building the story in layers of conversation that slowly fill in the world for us.
  Negative
It's an effective technique, especially coupled with its largely non-professional cast, and it means that when the film finally reaches its frenzied climax, it erupts, an intrusion into a world too easily idealized by outsiders.
  Positive
It's a stunning debut for Bustamante who spent many of his early years in the highlands of Guatemala recalling Ciro Guerra's Embrace of the Serpent in its jarring juxtaposition of ancient and modern, though its realism renders its conclusion both less mythical and more universal than Guerra's film.
  Positive
Ixcanul isn't about the destruction of a way of life' instead, it posits that in all cultures, the strong prey upon the weak.
  Negative
As with a number of films from around the world this year, the feminist message is urgent: for a society to be just, women must be granted the freedom to make decisions about their futures.
  Negative
Perhaps most remarkably, the titular volcano inIxcanul remains merely a backdrop to the story, which at its end returns to the same close-up of Mara as she's being prepared for her marriage by her mother.
  Negative
Mara's mother, we understand, has experienced her own tragedies.
  Neutral
Mara's future children will as well.
  Positive
Perhaps the women's calm was formed by generations living in the ever-present shadow of an active volcano, a looming suggestion that life is fragile, that it doesn't regenerate without untameable fury.
  Neutral
